                                            <p>
                                                What are the root causes of social injustice and inequality? How could we change society’s perception of them, and make the actual changes themselves? On this course you will reflect upon the ways in which sociological knowledge can affect real change in people’s everyday lives.

                                                If you have an enquiring, questioning mind and you want to understand more about human societies, social problems, interactions and experiences, you will thrive here. You’ll engage with a diversity of communities and develop a sense of the ways in which a public sociological imagination can meaningfully intervene in real-world political and social events. Many of our staff are actively involved in social justice, and so you will see first-hand how we can bring what we study to life.

                                            <p>If you love theatre and film you can study them both in depth on the only course of its kind in Scotland. The course combines practical work-based learning with a solid grounding in critical studies.You will learn about the histories of theatre and cinema, and examine the key critical cultural and political debates. You will explore the spaces of the stage and studio, stage and screen performances and the genres, narratives and authorship of plays and screenplays. We study the economics and management of theatre and cinema within the creative industries. Alongside the course’s academic core you will have plenty of opportunity to gain production experience from Year One, and can specialise in practice areas in later years.</p>
