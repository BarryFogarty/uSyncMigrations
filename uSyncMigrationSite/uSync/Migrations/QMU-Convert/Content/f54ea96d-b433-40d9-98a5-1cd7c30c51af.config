<ul>
<li><strong>Your theoretical learning will be complemented with practice in our Clinical Simulation Suite and in a variety of health and social care settings.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Small classes mean you will benefit from individual support from our highly experienced course team.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In our approach to learning and teaching, we use a range of creative ways to promote self, your self-development and skills for interacting with others.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/12ilaCnk4NY" data-embed-height="456" data-embed-width="950" data-embed-constrain="true"><iframe width="811" height="456" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12ilaCnk4NY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Master of Nursing (MNurse) at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh"></iframe></div>
<p>On this course you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to register with the NMC and practise as a nurse.</li>
<li>Be able to confidently deliver safe, effective and person-centred nursing care.</li>
<li>Become part of a community of learners, working collaboratively with lecturers, clinical staff, service users and other students on a transformational journey towards registration.</li>
<li>Actively engage in creative and critical ways of working and learning including approaches such as critical inquiry, reflection, contemplation, simulation and practice learning experiences.</li>
<li>Carry out invaluable practice learning experiences (PLEs) that will enrich your learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a nurse, you will be at the forefront of healthcare, meeting a broad range of people who truly need your expertise and empathy. Nurses are involved in promoting health and preventing illness in addition to caring for sick and dying people. This can take place in a variety of environments, which include health centres, homes, residential/care homes and hospitals. A career in nursing can take you into leadership and management, education and research, both at home and overseas. Wherever you choose to specialise in the future, as a nurse you will be an advocate for the people in your care. You will make a difference.</p>
<p>The course content is aligned to both the NMC Standards for Future Nurse Education and the Person-centred Framework for Nursing (McCormack and McCance, 2019). We therefore focus our learning units on parts of the framework which are: Metaparadigms, Pre-requisites, Care Environment and Person-centred Processes. These themes are developed across the four years and include group learning within a learning set and this is where you will build a personal portfolio of your learning in practice and in university.</p>
<p>Students will commence their studies with a view to graduating with a Master of Nursing (MNurse) in four years. There is an option for students to choose a BSc (Hons) route at the end of Year Two and complete the final two years at that level. For both routes, students will be eligible to apply for registration with the NMC as a registered adult nurse. Over the four years you will complete a total of 4,600 hours of theory and practice experience that is split equally. The hours will be the same for the BSc (Hons) and master’s route. The main difference is the credit level of the academic work that will be higher in the master’s to allow for a higher level final qualification.</p>]]></Value>

Introduction of third-sector PLEs and opportunities to work with specialist research nurses are being developed.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employablity PLEs take place across across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location. The additional costs associated with PLE travel and accommodation are the responsibility of the student. Students who receive SAAS funding may be able to claim for some of these expenses to be reimbursed.</p>"
