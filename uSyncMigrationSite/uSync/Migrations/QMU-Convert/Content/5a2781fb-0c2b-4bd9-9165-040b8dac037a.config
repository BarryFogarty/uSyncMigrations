<p><span class="lead">Growing food and drink through innovation</span></p>
<p><em>By David Thomson, CEO of Food and Drink Federation (FDF) Scotland</em></p>
<p>Food and drink is an essential part of everyone's lives and is critical to success of our economy. In Scotland our food and drink manufacturing industry employs 36,000 people, representing over 91% of manufacturing. As we exit the EU it is more important than ever that our economically vital companies are constantly innovating to ensure that they continue to thrive in changing environment. </p>
<p>Businesses could, for example, find ways to reduce their environmental impact which could also save them money; invest in new technology or equipment that could increase production; create new products or reformulate existing products to meet consumer demand; or invest in current and future staff. </p>
<p>Up-skilling the workforce and recruiting new talented individuals is essential to driving future innovation and growth. However food and drink is facing a skills gap, particularly in food science, technology and engineering. By 2024 Scottish food and drink manufacturing is going to need 19,000 new talented recruits to meet the skills needs of the sector. At FDF Scotland we view promoting careers in food and drink as a top priority.</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is a great supporter of food and drink innovation, working with companies including East Lothian micro-businesses producers and very large retailers.</p>
<p>The university’s desire for growth is one that supports our own – set out with our Scotland Food &amp; Drink partners as Ambition 2030 – a strategy which aims to sustainably grow the food and drink industry’s turnover from just over £14bn to £30bn by 2030.</p>
<p>Our strategy places innovation at its heart – streamlining the innovation landscape, facilitating collaboration between academia and industry, supporting automation and productivity. An innovation mind-set allows us to seek new markets at home and abroad, and to take opportunities we have not even dreamt up yet. Scotland’s great food and drink industry has a bright future. Queen Margaret University is an important part of that.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Shaping the Future</span></p>
<p>Students and staff at Queen Margaret University recently took the chance to contribute to the conversations taking place across Edinburgh and the Lothians on the vision<br />for the future of the region. Throughout its history, Edinburgh has been a city of innovation and change. Today, East Lothian is part of this successful city region where population is growing more quickly than any other major city in the UK, and whose strong economy and quality of life is recognised across the world. The University has already shared in the consultation experience, making clear our view that measurement of success should not focus solely on economic performance but also on its overall health, wellbeing and happiness.</p>
<p>It is this view that underpins our plans for Edinburgh Innovation Park at East Lothian’s prime employment site in a way which addresses economic development and community needs at the same time.</p>
<p>This view is also reflected in our plans for a commercial hub between the existing University buildings and Edinburgh Innovation Park.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Next Steps</span></p>
<p>A three way public/private/community partnership approach to the proposed development will be key to its successful delivery. Working closely with East Lothian Council, QMU is now working on a detailed development pathway</p>
<p><span class="lead">More Information</span></p>
<p>More information available via  <a href="http://www.edinburghinnovationpark.co.uk" title="Edinburgh Innovation Park">Edinburgh Innovation Park</a>  The website features detailed site plans and places the innovation park in context, including details of the associated commercial hub which will provide retail and leisure facilities for the local community, innovation park users, and QMU students and staff.</p>
