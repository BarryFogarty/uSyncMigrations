      "title": "1 Summative online examinations",
      "content": "<p>Online examinations, using the Tests tool in the Hub, provide you with an additional assessment instrument and a potential alternative to paper-based examinations. This document provides a guide to issues that you should consider when organising online examinations in QMU.</p>\n<p>An online examination requires careful, detailed planning and time. You need to liaise with the Centre for Academic Practice (CAP), Information Services, Room Bookings, your School Office, Registry, and at least one colleague.</p>\n<p>The benefits of online examinations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the time that you spend marking</li>\n<li>Providing quicker feedback to the students</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important: Please do not be discouraged by the length of this guide. Online Exams using the Tests feature in the HUB can make a dramatic improvement to both your marking workload and the student learning experience. To gain these benefits requires some upfront investment in time to and to help, we have written this guide to make the path as easy as possible. This guide contains crucial information and guidance about setting up exams in the HUB, as well as the administrative and practical factors that you need to consider in your planning.</p>\n<p>Like any examination, the results from online examinations will still need to be presented at a Board of Examiners before the results are confirmed. Announcements or email sent to students advising them that the results are released through the Hub must state that they are subject to Examination Board approval.</p>\n<p>To hold an online examination, you will need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create three online assessments (examinations) within the Hub:\n<ul>\n<li>a mock examination (with multiple attempts allowed)</li>\n<li>the examination plus emergency copy</li>\n<li>another examination for reassessments</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these need to be checked by a colleague; this is, in addition, to the moderation of examinations required by QMU regulations. The CAP will help you with the creation of the examination in the Hub.</p>\n<p><strong>1.1 Essential steps</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure the ‘My Grades’ Tool has been made available / enabled for the module, without this you and your students will not be able to see the results of their tests. This is done by the following set of actions in the left hand menu Course Management &gt; Customisation &gt; Toll Aavailability &gt; MyGrades (click the box in the ‘Available’ column). NB: But do not make this tool visible in the left hand module navigation menu.</p>\n<p>Tutor guide to summative online examinations using Hub@QMU - 6 -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend time designing and preparing the examination, setting up the examination with appropriate marks allocated for each question and checking these with a colleague</li>\n<li>Prepare your students and ensure that they are familiar with the Hub environment and have used the mock examination</li>\n<li>Ensure that students cannot see the examination results until they have been moderated and you are ready to release them</li>\n<li>Work, with the School Office and Registry, where necessary, to organise invigilators, and assessment arrangements. Examination booklets are not printed unless specifically required, for example, where a student cannot look at a computer screen for extended periods. If necessary, CAP can print out a paper copy of the online examination, but this will not include any images</li>\n<li>Be at the online examination to support your students and the invigilators</li>\n<li>Know how to change high contrast / text size settings in the Hub</li>\n<li>Check the results and inform the School Office so they can transfer the marks from the Hub to ISIS</li>\n<li>Organise for your external examiner to have access to the online examinations in the Hub before the Board of Examiners and contact the School Office to ensure the external examiners have a QMU account</li>\n<li>Organise reassessments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This guide explains each of these steps in detail. We recommend meeting with a member of the CAP if you have not held an online examination before.</p>\n<p>Please note: Registry will only assist in running your online examination if the examination is during official University Examination Weeks that usually occur in December/January, April/May and August/September. If your online examination is during this time, Registry will book computer workshops, assist with students with assessment arrangements, and with invigilators. If your online examination is not during University Examination Weeks, you will need to book computer workshops, organise for students with assessment arrangements and book rooms yourself. Always check this with the CAP.</p>\n<p> </p>"

      "title": "2 Designing, creating and managing online examinations and questions",
      "content": "<p>The first thing to check is that you have the My Grades tool enabled in your Hub Module, without this the Test Tool will not work. To enable this go to Customisation in the left hand menu and then &gt; Tool Availability &gt; and then select the option to make My Grades available in the list of tools by clicking in the box. See diagram below:</p>\n<p>As you make more use of online tests you will come to realise that that there is a whole lifecycle of activities involved in the successful adoption of these kinds of Computer Assisted Assessment (CAA). This short section is intended to introduce you to some of the main elements of the CAA lifecycle. The TELTRAINING area for staff in the Hub has some useful guidance to get you started as well as sources of further information for your own development.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 Designing your questions</strong></p>\n<p>It is worth putting time into the design of your questions before creating them in the Hub. Always make sure your online examination is aligned with the learning outcomes of the module. We would recommend that you design your questions in WORD first and also collect any images you are going to use for questions and place them in folders on your computer with your questions.</p>\n<p>There is a useful set of introductory guides on the subject of online exams and tests in the staff training area of the HUB called TELTRAINING: Technology Enhanced Learning Training Area.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Creating your questions</strong></p>\n<p>To create an online examination in the Hub you use the Tests tool (Course Tools&gt;Tests, Surveys and Pools&gt;Tests). There are many different question types available including: multiple choice, fill in the blank, short answer, image hot spot and numeric calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>2.3 Managing your questions with (Question)</strong></p>\n<p>Pools Question Pools help you manage your questions. With these tools you can collect copies of questions from your tests as well as import questions from elsewhere and edit them and tag them for different purposes. It is best to think of pools as a kind of personal library or archive that can hold your questions from where you can gather and create your own customised question banks and copy them to create new tests – all without destroying or altering the original questions. The Pools function can be accessed from the Control Panel &gt; Course Tools &gt; Tests, Surveys and Pools &gt; Pools.</p>\n<p><strong>2.4 Evaluating and reviewing your questions test results</strong></p>\n<p>You can review the test results and feedback for each student in the Grade Centre. In addition, the item Analysis Tool provides detailed feedback about how your test has performed after an examination with information broken down for each question in an easy to view manner. This review activity is an essential component of the online testing lifecycle (as it is of teaching in general). You can access this tool by going to Control Panel &gt; Test, Surveys and Pools &gt; Tests &gt; Select your Test &gt; and then from the white chevron dropdown menu &gt; Item Analysis &gt; Select Your Test (choose from dropdown list) &gt; Run. Be sure to read the More Help notes for this tool as you are provided with information about average scores, questions which were and were not answered and levels of difficulty.</p>\n<p>The pools function allows you to easily alter questions in the light of how they have been answered by your students and lets you edit them to rapidly create new questions and substitute them into tests – or create new tests</p>\n<p><strong>2.5 Setting the marks for each question in the Hub</strong></p>\n<p>Each question is provided with a separate mark and in some circumstances, for example, in Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), you may consider using negative marking (for instance to discourage guessing). This means that if students select the wrong answer, they receive a minus mark. Check this with the programme leader to ensure it is appropriate for the particular programme as there are both advantages and disadvantages with negative marking. It is also possible to give partial marks, for example, 1 out of 2.

      "title": "3 Preventing marks being released accidentally in the Hub",
      "content": "<p><strong>3.1 Making the marks invisible in the Hub via the Grade Centre</strong></p>\n<p>When you create a test in the Hub it automatically creates a column for that test in the Grade Centre. It is vitally important that you make this column unavailable to students otherwise it is possible that marks may be visible before they are officially released. To do this go to Grade Centre&gt;Full Grade Centre and locate the column for the test. Click the dropdown menu next to the column header and choose Show / Hide to Users. When the column is hidden to users an icon will be visible in the column header, which looks like a grey circle with a diagonal red line through it. See diagram below:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The marks from any test or assignment in the Hub may also display as part of the Total and Weighted Total columns. These columns may be visible in the Hub mobile app and it is recommended that these columns are also made unavailable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Weighted Total column can be made unavailable the same way as the column for the examination using the Show / Hide to Users option.</li>\n<li>To hide the Total column, click the drop-down menu next to the Total column header and choose the option to Edit Column Information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Then, in the next screen, (in Section 4 of that screen) change the option to Display to Student to No and click Submit to save</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Remember that you will need to create three examinations: the mock; the examination (plus the emergency copy) and the resit. You do not have to hide the Grade Centre columns for the mock examination.</p>\n<p><strong>3.2 Making the marks invisible in the HUB via the Test Feedback Options</strong></p>\n<p>You also need to choose the Test Feedback options as part of the general Test options when setting your test in the Hub (see section 4.6 for detailed guidance about this). This governs what the students will see immediately after the end of the test regardless of whether or not you have hidden the Grade Centre column. Thus, if you do not deselect the Scores option in the feedback settings the students will see their scores immediately at the end of their test. Even if you have hidden the Grade Centre column, if you do not deselect the Score setting in feedback the student will see their score immediately at the conclusion of their test. But, they will not see their score afterwards, if they return to the test after leaving it.</p>\n<p>A good way to conceptualise this interaction between the Grade Centre column and the Feedback settings is that the Hub Grade Centre records everything about the test and the Feedback settings control what the student sees of that recording and the Grade Centre controls whether or not the student can see the recording or not after the test.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What feedback the student sees immediately at the conclusion of the test is governed by the feedback settings.</li>\n<li>Whether or not the student can see that feedback after a test is governed by the Grade Centre column settings. In addition the tutor can choose to hide everything in feedback from the student at the end of a test.</li>\n</ul>"

      "title": "4 Setting up the test in the Hub (Test Options)",
      "content": "<p>This section steps you through the process of setting up your examination in the Hub using the Edit Test Options controls, in the order that they appear on the Edit Test Options page.</p>\n<p>For students to access the test it must be deployed to a Content area on your Hub module. This can be done in any Content Area page where the Assessments Tab appears; it is probably best for you to place the test in the standard assignments area.</p>\n<p>Click on Assessments/Tests and select the appropriate test. There are a number of Test Options that control how the assessment is delivered and displayed, these are described below in the rest of this section where the secondary 4.X headings correspond to the numbered main sections of the Edit Test Option page in the order that they appear.</p>\n<p><strong>4.1 Test Information</strong></p>\n<p>This is where you enter the name of the Test and any descriptive text that is needed. There are options here to choose how to show the description of the Test and the Test Instructions to the students – generally, we recommend, not checking these boxes – so that the description and the instructions appear at the same time as the test.</p>\n<p><strong>4.1.1 Open Test in a New Window</strong></p>\n<p>This is recommended so that only the Assessment window is visible when students complete the assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2 Test Availability</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.2.1 Make the Link Available</strong></p>\n<p>In order for the students to see the assessment this needs to be set to Yes. You will be inputting availability dates later in the options in which case the assessment will only become available after the Display After date. However, for an extra layer of security you may wish to leave the Make Link Available option set to No but you must remember to edit this to Yes before the examination.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2.2 Add a New Announcement for this Test</strong></p>\n<p>For summative online exams, only, this option should be left to the default of No. This is to avoid stressing students as they might construe a sudden announcement in the Hub as an unscheduled examination.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2.3 Multiple Attempts</strong></p>\n<p>For summative exams students should only be able to have one attempt so leave the Multiple Attempts box unchecked. If you are setting up a formative exam then you may wish to allow multiple attempts. In this case, a dropdown menu option becomes available with the name of ‘Score attempts using’ and the options from the menu decide how the scores are recorded, we suggest for a formative exam that the option of ‘Last Graded Attempt’ is chosen from this dropdown menu. This way the students will see the score from their latest attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2.4 Force Completion</strong></p>\n<p>This option forces the assessment to be submitted once it has been started. This means that students are unable to save their answers, leave the examination and return to it later. It is recommended that this option is checked so that students cannot save their answers, leave the examination and restart outwith the examination room.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: If the Force Completion option is not ticked then the instructions to the student as they begin the test should state that test may be saved and resumed later. However, if the examination is timed (as most summative exams are), the clock does not stop but continues to run down until it expires or the student submits the test. The means the student can leave the test with the clock running and go elsewhere in the Hub and then return to the test. This could be confusing for students; we recommend not leaving this option unselected, in order to prevent this scenario occurring.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2.5 Set Timer</strong></p>\n<p>The timer function should be set for the total time of the examination, including any reading time.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2.6 Auto-Submit</strong></p>\n<p>The auto-submit option, if checked, will save and submit a student’s attempt when the time has expired. If the auto-submit option is not checked, students will be able to continue after the time has expired and will need to manually submit their attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Although the auto-submit function is useful, it is our recommendation that this is NOT used for summative examinations. In the event of a fire alarm or other circumstance where the students would be allocated extra time once the examination has started, the auto submit function would prevent the ad hoc extension of time by the invigilator - as it cannot be rescinded once the exam has started. Likewise, further time added to the test settings once a student has begun the test, will not be reflected on the student timer. Not selecting the auto-submit option means that it is up to the examination invigilator to ask students to stop, save and submit their answers manually. This gives the invigilators the flexibility to deal with unforeseen events.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2.7 Display After / Display Until</strong></p>\n<p>These dates and times should be set to allow students access to the online assessment for a limited time. It is recommended that the start time is set to 15 minutes prior to the actual start time in the computer lab (students will not be able to begin the examination until they have received the password). It is recommended that the end time is set to about 30 minutes after the examination to include late arrivals. This provides flexibility for the invigilator</p>\n<p><strong>4.2.8 Password</strong></p>\n<p>An online examination in the Hub should be set with a password to aid security. This password is only released to the students a few minutes before the examination by the invigilator. It ensures that students cannot access the examination from outwith the examination room, as the tutor, you can set passwords. It is best to choose a word that is relatively easy for the students to type. To increase security, make sure that different examinations use different passwords.</p>\n<p><strong>4.3 Test Availability Exceptions</strong></p>\n<p>This allows you to release the same test to different users and groups, but with different timing settings –very useful for students with special needs, see section 6.3. Essentially, with this option you can create customised versions of the same test for different individual or groups of students. Another application of this option is for splitting large cohorts of students into manageable groups in order to hold an online examination (for instance to assign the groups to different computer labs or other facilities).</p>\n<p><strong>4.4 Due Date</strong></p>\n<p>For summative assessments, it is not necessary to put in a due date.</p>\n<p><strong>4.5 Self-Assessment Options</strong></p>\n<p>These options should either be left as default or the option to include in Grade Centre Calculations should be unchecked. It will depend on whether you wish to use the calculated column functions within the Grade Centre which option you choose. If you are not using the calculated function then it does not matter which option. DO NOT select Hide Results for this Test Completely from Instructor and the Grade Centre option as this will prevent the scores being stored in the Grade Centre.</p>\n<p><strong>4.6 Show Test Results and Feedback to Students</strong></p>\n<p>The options in this section will determine what students see after they have submitted their answers. There are a number of choices in this section that govern when the results can be released and what is released..</p>\n<p>There are two sets of options that allow tutors to set up rules to govern when and what to show for the results and feedback to students. Used together, these rules can provide sophisticated control over the timing of the visibility and the amount of results and feedback that are shown to the students. However, for our purposes we recommend it is best to keep things simple, in order to avoid undue complexity and confusion. Therefore, we shall only use the top set of rule options for showing test results and feedback to students (indicated in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For a summative examination, in most cases, you will just want to reveal the score to your students, but only after checking the submissions and liaising with the School Office first. In this case, this will mean taking steps to hide the score and feedback from students at the end of the exam</p>\n<p>For mock examinations, you will need to reveal more than the just the score to the students, you should provide feedback as well, using these controls.</p>\n<p>If you are using an online test for formative assessment in your module in order to assess your students’ current level of understanding, you may wish to provide more feedback than just the score.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>The following rule options are available – working from left to right:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 252px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 147px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 18.75%; height: 147px;\">When</th>\n<td style=\"width: 81.25%; height: 147px;\">This has a number of options but do not use the After Submission option for summative online examinations as the tutor must check the results before releasing.

It is recommended that On a Specific Date is chosen and that a date at least four weeks after the online examination is chosen.

This can be a suitable setting for a mock exam but not for a summative examination, as this would potentially invalidate it for future use by releasing it into the public domain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Please Note for summative online examinations:</p>\n<p>To reiterate, it will be best not to release all the possible and submitted and correct answers as this will put the examination potentially into the public domain and affect its viability for future use.</p>\n<p>For mock examinations, as opposed to summative examinations, it is appropriate to release all the Scores and Feedback (Score plus All Answers plus Correct Answers plus Submitted Answers). The rationale for this is that a mock examination exercise should provide rich feedback to students in preparation for their summative examination.</p>\n<p>For summative examinations, it may be appropriate just to release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the score</li>\n<li>the submitted answer (which will have a tick or cross next to it to indicate right or wrong)</li>\n<li>any tutor feedback. The exact amount and format of feedback chosen is the responsibility of the tutor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It will be best for you to experiment with a test examination to develop what kind of feedback you want to release, when, and under what conditions. A useful example of what the feedback can look like to the students is provided below in section 4.6.1.</p>\n<p>There are also other parts of the Blackboard / Hub system that can control and affect access to test results by students (these should be checked when debugging a test that does not operate properly), these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check: Test Options&gt;Adaptive Release Settings for the Test</li>\n<li>Check: Grade Centre&gt;Full Grade Centre&gt;Test (Name) Column&gt;Show /Hide to Users</li>\n<li>Check: My Grades Availability&gt;Customisation&gt;Tool Availability&gt;My Grades</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the tutor, you will check the Test submissions in the Grade Centre. This allows you as the tutor to either manually grade questions where applicable, or in the case of solely automatically marked questions (such as MCQ) it allows you just to check the submissions before releasing the marks and feedback to the students. Once the submissions have been checked and / or marked and you are ready to release the scores you can use the controls in the Edit Test Options &gt; Show Test Results and Feedback to Students as discussed above.</p>\n<p>4.6.1 Example of Test Results and Feedback to Students</p>\n<p>Below is an example of how a simple 2-question MCQ test results and feedback will appear to students immediately after submission with every option for Result and Feedback activated. There are 2 questions in this test and they are as follows (with the correct answer indicated by an *</p>\n<p>Q1 What is John’s favourite plant?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rose</li>\n<li>Parsley</li>\n<li>Dandelion</li>\n<li>Lavender *</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Q2 What is John’s favourite beverage?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tea *</li>\n<li>Water</li>\n<li>Beer</li>\n<li>Irn Bru</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the results and feedback shown below the student has given a correct answer for Q1 but has given an incorrect answer to Q2. The results and feedback appear in 2 stages, shown in the next 2 section below<strong>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.6.2 Test Results and Feedback Stage 1</strong></p>\n<p>Below is what the students see after they have saved and submitted the test:</p>\n<p><strong>4.6.3 Test Results and Feedback Stage 2</strong></p>\n<p>Below is what the student sees after they have clicked on ‘OK’ in the preceding step:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4.7 Test Presentation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.7.1 Display All questions at Once / One at a Time Option</strong></p>\n<p>If the students are allowed reading time then in order for them to view all the questions, it is recommended that the Presentation Mode is set to All at Once – all questions will be displayed and it is easy for the student to move back and forth between them. The other option is to release the questions one at a time to students; this may be appropriate in some circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>4.7.2 Prohibit Backtracking</strong></p>\n<p>There is a further option available if you have selected to display questions one at a time and that is the option to prohibit backtracking to previous questions – so the student can only work forwards through the test. This is not recommended for summative examinations.</p>\n<p><strong>4.7.3 Randomised display of questions</strong></p>\n<p>Option This allows questions to be displayed in a random order for each student, helping to prevent cheating in the examination.</p>\n<p><strong>4.8 Tracking students</strong></p>\n<p>It is recommended that after you have deployed the test, you use the statistics tracking functionality. On the drop-down menu next to the test, select Statistics Tracking (On/Off). If there are issues if students have or have not taken the examination, this will provide further information.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>6.1 An emergency copy of your examination</strong></p>\n<p>It is strongly recommended that you create an emergency copy of your examination which is not deployed to the students and called Emergency ‘Exam Name’. Just in case, you quickly need a new version of the examination, for example, if a student’s computer crashes and they need to start the examination again.</p>\n<p><strong>6.2 Additional resources such as transcripts, source material</strong></p>\n<p>You may be using materials that students need to read prior to answering a question such as a case study or an article. Make sure that these are provided and linked to the appropriate questions. In some cases, you may wish to make this supporting material available to students prior to the online assessment so that students can print out on appropriate coloured paper or adjust formatting.</p>\n<p><strong>6.3 Supporting students with ILPs / Special Needs</strong></p>\n<p><strong>6.3.1 Time</strong></p>\n<p>Some students may be allocated extra time for the assessment (this is usually 25%, that is, 15 minutes per hour, but in some cases can be as much as 50% extra time). Other students such as international students may also require extra time. In this case, the Hub enables you create the test and then in the Edit Test Options you use Test Availability Exceptions to set up customised time version of the same test for individual students or groups of students (see section 4.3 of this guide for more information).</p>\n<p><strong>6.3.2 Readers and scribes</strong></p>\n<p>In a minority of cases, for example, when a reader or scribe is necessary, a separate room is required. If the examination falls within the University examination weeks, Registry will organise this. If the examination is outwith the University examination weeks, you will need to organise a separate room and reader/scribe. You could use the small rooms in Student Services for this purpose. Remember to visit these rooms on the day as part of your invigilator role. Students with a reader and scribe are always awarded extra time.</p>\n<p><strong>6.3.3 Paper versions</strong></p>\n<p>If you have randomised the order of questions/answers and a student has requested a paper copy in addition to using the online examination, you should be aware that the order of questions/answers will be different between the paper and online version. You may need to counsel the student in advance of the examination about whether a paper version only may reduce any confusion. However, it is strongly recommended that you do not use a paper copy unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>6.4 Reading time</strong></p>\n<p>It is common for reading time to be added to the overall time for the assessment. It must be made clear to the students and the invigilator that this time is included in the timer for the examination. As students may all be starting at slightly different times, the reading time will be specific to each student’s timer and so it can confuse the students if the invigilator is using the clock on the wall to determine when the reading time has expired. It is advised that the invigilator prompts the students to check their timer to check when the reading time is over.</p>\n<p><strong>6.5 Use of dictionaries and calculators</strong></p>\n<p>You need to advise students if they can bring these into the examination.</p>\n<p><strong>6.6 Statistics tracking to monitor student attendance</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6.7 Dealing with late arrivals and emergencies</strong></p>\n<p>Arrange a space in the computer lab / exam room where late arrivals may be accommodated without disturbing the other students. Because the test options recommended here suggest setting the Display After / Display Until to about 30 minutes after the official end time, this gives the invigilator the option to start an examination for late arrivals, up to half an hour late. If appropriate, the invigilator can use the emergency examination that has not been deployed.</p>\n<p><strong>6.8 Dealing with very large cohorts</strong></p>\n<p>It is possible to assign students to groups and using the Test Availability Exceptions options to set up customised time versions of the same test for each group – section 4.3 of this guide</p>"

      "content": "<p>This section explains how to prepare your students for an online examination. For many students, this is still a new experience and to alleviate any concerns, it is essential to provide the students with a mock examination. The mock ensures that students become familiar with the Hub Test tools and the online examination procedures at QMU:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a range of questions that mirror the ‘real’ examination. For example, if you are using a mixture of short paragraph and Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) ensure that both of these are included in the mock</li>\n<li>Explain to students how to save questions and emphasise that they must save each question as they progress through the examination. It is possible for students to return to a saved question and change their answer</li>\n<li>Describe how to submit the examination using the Save and Submit button</li>\n<li>Ensure that students are informed of date, time and their respective computer workshops locations i.e. room number via the Hub announcements and other communication channels such as email and at lectures etc. If it is an Examination during official Examination week, the information should be available on the Examination timetable issued by Registry</li>\n<li>Inform the students of when the results will be released. Remind them that any results will need to be validated by the Board of Examiners before they are finalised</li>\n<li>Give students the guide to operating the assessment in Appendix 1 and ensure they are attempting the mock exam by using the “statistics tracking” facility in the Hub or check attempts directly from the Grade Centre</li>\n<li>Remind students to bring their matriculation card because they will not be able to take the assessment without this</li>\n<li>Suggest that students may wish to bring water as the computer workshops are often very hot and dry</li>\n<li>Explain about using passwords for the assessment. This is to protect them as much as you and the Institution. If students are provided with the password just before the assessment, it is another check that students are taking the examination in QMU rather than outwith.</li>\n<li>Show students how to reset the text size in a browser such as Internet Explorer. The size of text displayed in the online assignment can be increased to help students read from the screen. Some students will not be aware of this functionality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From time to time, you may find that some students are very reluctant to take an online examination; they may feel that they are being penalised because of their typing or technical skills. To avoid this, make sure that students know from the start of the module that they will be taking an online examination. It is very tempting to provide a paper copy of an online examination but research has shown that this is not the same experience as taking an online assessment. Please contact the CAP if you would like further information about this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7.1 Off-Campus students taking an online examination at QMU</strong></p>\n<p>From time to time distance learning students may be asked to attend an on campus online examination. Remember, if these students have to travel to the campus for the first time in order to take an online exam this is likely to be rather stressful for them – so these measures are intended to alleviate the stress and manage the situation. In this situation the following points apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will need to allow extra time to arrange for the students to receive ID cards so they can enter the LRC computer labs</li>\n<li>The students will be logging into the campus based system for the first time – so extra time needs to be allowed for this and extra staff should be on hand to deal with any issues</li>\n<li>You should arrange a short ‘warm up’ examination of the same kind you are setting just to check that the system is working normally. This is in addition to the mock examination that the students will have accessed previously. Comfort breaks are also recommended before starting the examination.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7.2 Taking an online examination outwith QMU</strong></p>\n<p>It is possible to organise an online examination, for example, for re-sits outwith QMU. Please contact the CAP to discuss. In discussions with students remind them that they will probably need to pay for a location accepted by Registry, for example, British Council premises, and invigilators.</p>\n<p> </p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>8.1 Working with Information Services (IS)</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure that you contact IS at least several weeks in advance and that they are fully aware of any online examination. You will need to consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘IS At risk time’ – check with IS when the ‘at risk period’ is during the week. This is the time when IS perform weekly maintenance of IS systems. Currently the ‘at risk period’ is Friday 7 am to 9 am. Email ishelpdesk@qmu.ac.uk for further information.</li>\n<li>‘Planned maintenance’ It is worthwhile checking with IS on ishelpdesk@qmu.ac.uk if there is planned maintenance near to your examination time.</li>\n<li>LRC support. Ask LRC if they could have a member of their team available just before the examination (within or outwith Examination Week) to help with passwords. They could also be asked to check the computer workshops so that all the computers are working for the online assessment. Please remember that the earlier they are informed, the more likely that LRC can help</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8.2 Working with room bookings</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure that you have booked sufficient workshops for the assessment. If you have a large number of students, you will probably need to book several of the computer workshops and therefore, it is essential that you do this as early as possible. The computer workshops can accommodate 30 students: to ensure there is sufficient space for 60 students, book 4 computer workshops i.e. 15 students per computer workshop. Don’t forget to book the computer workshops for as long as required by all students including those with specific requirements.</p>\n<p>Student Services Rooms can be booked by contacting studentservices@qmu.ac.uk for students who have specific requirements.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8.3 Working with Registry</strong></p>\n<p>If the examination is within the Examination Week then you must inform Registry of the date and time of the examination and they will book computer workshops, organise assessment arrangements for students with disabilities with an ILP and organise invigilators. In some cases, one tutor will be responsible for liaising with Registry for their subject area regarding students with an ILP. Always check in your subject area. Don’t forget to tell Registry that you will not need paper copies of your examination unless in special circumstances a student’s ILP requires this. In this case you should liaise with CAP who can work with you to provide a paper copy of the online examination.</p>\n<p>If the examination is outwith the Examination Week then you will need to book computer workshops, organise assessment arrangements for students with an ILP and organise invigilators.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8.4 Invigilators</strong></p>\n<p>All invigilators will need to be prepared about the online examination: do not assume that they will have experience of online examination.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8.4.1 For online examinations within Examination Week</strong></p>\n<p>Registry will try to organise for invigilators who are familiar with online examinations but this will not always be the case. Please remember that for all Registry-run assessments, you will usually be provided with one invigilator for each room, and where possible an extra invigilator who can take students to the toilet, etc.</p>\n<p>As the tutor, you will be expected to be in the computer lab at the start of the online assessment to answer any student or invigilator queries</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8.4.2 For online examinations outwith Examination Week</strong></p>\n<p>If you are holding an online assessment outwith the normal examination period then you will be responsible for invigilation arrangements.</p>\n<p>The invigilators will need a list of students and sufficient attendance slips. Invigilators will need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The length of the examination and how the start and stop times of the exam will be handled;</li>\n<li>The special password for the assessment;</li>\n<li>That students will use their ‘usual’ password to log into the Hub;</li>\n<li>That students need to be told to save regularly throughout the online examination and must submit at the end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please remind all invigilators that they will need to collect the attendance slips after the students have signed them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8.5 CAP</strong></p>\n<p>Alert the CAP about the online examination as far in advance as possible so that they can provide technical support on the day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8.6 Checking your Hub area</strong></p>\n<p>Before the online examination, it is worth checking if there are any materials that you would not wish the students to access during the online examination. This might include hand-outs, the online mock examination or discussions. You can hide such materials and tools in the Hub during the online examination and then release them afterwards. It is also recommended that you disable/hide chat and online discussions for the duration of the online examination.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have also made the columns for the test(s) in the Grade Centre hidden and (see Section 3.2 of this document: ‘Preventing marks being released accidentally in the Hub’</p>"

NB: But do not make this tool visible in the left hand module navigation menu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.2 What happens if a student arrives late through no fault of their own, for example, a student is delayed by the Forth Road Bridge closing?</strong></p>\n<p>The online examinations in the Hub are timed by the invigilator from when they give the students the password to begin. If a student is late arriving they can still begin the examination and will have the same time to complete the examination as those who started at the correct time.</p>\n<p>An Important Note About Exam Timing:</p>\n<p>Because we do not enable the ‘Auto-Submit’ function the Timer in the HUB Test is just that ‘a timer’ – i.e. it presents the time to the student to help them manage their progress through the exam. When the timer counts down to zero the student can still make changes to the exam, if the Auto-Submit’ function was enabled the timer reaching zero would trigger the close of the exam and the saving of any outstanding changes made by the student. It is up to the student to manually ‘Save and Submit’ the exam when they have finished.</p>\n<p>An important Note about Exam Availability:</p>\n<p>Because we use the ‘Display After / Display Until’ controls when setting up the test availability this enables us to hide the link to the test from the students in the HUB until the allocated time slot for the exam. After that the link will disappear. It is important to understand that as long as the student starts the exam before the ‘Display Until’ time, then the exam will remain open for them until they choose to manually ‘Save and Submit. This means in the case of late arriving students the emergency exam copy will only need to be used for students that arrive later than the allocated ‘Display Until’ time, i.e. when the link to the exam has disappeared.</p>\n<p>To make the emergency copy of the exam available will entail the tutor / invigilator / CAP assistant changing the ‘Display After / Display Until’ controls for the emergency exam to make the link available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.3 What are the institutional procedures for students who require extra time for an examination?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see section 6.3 Supporting students with ILPs / Special Needs</p>\n<p>Do not book a specific computer workshop for students who require extra time – this can be viewed as stigmatising students in this category. Only book a separate room if students require a scribe or reader.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.4 What should I do if I can’t find a student’s Test submission information in the Hub after the online examination?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if the student attended the online examination by checking the attendance slips</li>\n<li>If the student has signed the attendance slip, check if the student logged into the Hub using the tracking reports in the Hub. These are available from Evaluation&gt;Course Reports</li>\n<li>If Statistics Tracking has been enabled for the assessment (see Section 6.6) it is possible to check if the student clicked on the link to the assessment in the Hub. In the drop-down menu next to the link to the assessment, choose View Statistics Report</li>\n<li>Check with IS if the student logged in. IS keeps logs of workshop use for several days and they may be able to check if the student logged into the system that day at QMU.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.5 What happens if a thin client terminal crashes?</strong></p>\n<p>If a terminal crashes any student answers that have been saved are recorded as a submission and that attempt can no longer be accessed by the student. There are two possible options on how to deal with such a situation. In either case it would be preferable to liaise with the student to decide which the most appropriate option is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the student has only just started the examination then it is possible to use the emergency version of the examination for them and they can start the examination again, with the timer adjusted as necessary; e.g. for reading time already completed</li>\n<li>If the student has completed a substantial part of the assessment, then they can start the emergency copy of the examination from where they left off (with the invigilator making an appropriate time allowance). This time allowance should allow for the fact that the questions are displayed all at once and are randomised - so the order in the emergency examination will be different.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In both cases, the invigilator should note what has happened.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.6 What should I do if there is a fire alarm during the online examination?</strong></p>\n<p>Appendix 2 has a copy of the QMU’s regulations regarding fire alarms and online examinations. In line with these you should ask the students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure they have saved all the questions that they have answered for the assessment but not to submit them</li>\n<li>To lock their computer terminal</li>\n<li>To leave the room as quickly as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on how long the fire alarm is and how much of the assessment has been completed, the students may return to the workshop and complete their online examination or not (see Appendix 2).</p>\n<p>If the students are to continue the online examination, they must log back into the computers and continue the online examination. The time to log in must not be counted towards the time for the examination. Because the examination has not had the auto-submit option enabled, when the timer reaches zero students will be able to continue (without the timer) until the invigilator manually stops the exam and asks the students to save and submit their answers.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: When the timer runs out a pop-up message appears on the student’s screen asking if they wish to continue or save and submit their answers. It is very important to make students aware that this message will appear and to make sure that they choose the option to continue.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.7 I want to run an examination online. The traditional paper-based examination is not usually organised by Registry. Will Registry supply invigilators?</strong></p>\n<p>Registry will only supply invigilators for examinations that are within the official university’s examination weeks. If you are unsure, contact Registry and check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.8 I want to include a special font in a question. Is this possible?</strong></p>\n<p>It may be possible to convert diagrams or questions with special fonts into image files and then import then into the Hub. Always check this beforehand and, if necessary, contact the CAP for further advice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.9 In my paper-based assessment, students can draw their own diagrams in response to questions. Does the Hub have a facility to allow this?</strong></p>\n<p>This is NOT possible in the Hub.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.10 What should I do if a student becomes seriously unwell or perhaps suffers a seizure in an examination?</strong></p>\n<p>Phone 2222 immediately and inform First Aid staff of your name and the room where the incident has taken/is taking place. If possible give details of the student name and matriculation number and describe what has happened. If you are not a QMU First Aider, you should not attempt to provide First Aid to the student</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>14.11 How does the invigilator cope with students who have different times to complete the online examination?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see section 6.3 Supporting students with ILPs / Special Needs</p>"

      "content": "<p>Dr. Felix Schaeffler has kindly allowed us to share working examples of his online exam documentation. This is to help you prepare your own documentation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>19.1 Student Instructions for S4143</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions for the online exam</strong></p>\n<p>The S4143 exam will be a multiple choice exam. The exam will be performed on a computer, within the QMU HUB environment, in one of the computer workshops at QMU. The exam will have 75 questions with 4 answer options each (and a fifth I don’t know option, explained below).</p>\n<p>There will be 15 questions for each of the five sub-areas of the S4143 module, i.e. Phonology, Phonetics, Syntax and Morphology, Speech Science, and Language Acquisition.</p>\n<p>You will have 3 hours to answer the questions.</p>\n<p>On the Hub, in the Assessment area, you will find a ‘mock exam’ with a selection of questions that exemplify the type of questions you can expect in the proper exam.</p>\n<p>The mock exam looks exactly like the proper exam, but it is shorter, containing only 5 questions per sub-area. The mock exam has a password (‘mock99’) that you have to type in before you can start the assessment (The same will apply to the proper exam, see below).</p>\n<p>Scoring:</p>\n<p>A multiple choice exam permits guessing, so if you have four answer options, you would, on average, score 25% correct, even if you did not know anything about a given topic. This is because you have a 25% chance of getting the right answer just by choosing at random. To compensate for guessing, we are applying negative scoring for wrong answers. Every correct answer will score 1 point, while every incorrect answer will score -0.33 points. This will result in 0 marks for the total exam if you only get 25% of the questions right and answer all others incorrectly. The exam format also allows you not to answer a question at all, if you are too unsure about the answer. In this case, the question will score 0 points.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to not answer a question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leave the question out in the first place – i.e. simply choose not to click on any of the answer options.</li>\n<li>Choose the I don’t know option. This is the only option if you already answered a question, but then decide that you are not sure enough about the correct answer. You cannot completely de-select a whole question once you have answered it. That is why we included the I don’t know option. Don’t be surprised that the I don’t know option isn’t always the first or last one available. Most questions randomise their order of answers for every trial, including the I don’t know option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both 1. and 2. will result in a score of 0 points for this particular question.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>General procedure</strong></p>\n<p>These steps apply to the mock as well as to the proper exam – apart from the path leading to the exam. You will get the path for the proper exam on examination day.</p>\n<p>For the mock exam, go to the S4143 Hub area. Choose Assessment. Choose the link Mock exam. You will see a page with a few instructions. Click on ‘Begin’. The next page asks for a password.</p>\n<p>Type in the password “mock99” for the mock exam. The password for the proper exam will be given to you on the day, in the examination room, shortly before the exam starts. This is to ensure that the exam is not accessed by somebody outside the examination rooms, i.e. it will not be possible to do the actual exam from home during the allocated time (or at any other time)!</p>\n<p>Once you click “Submit”, the completion time starts to run and you have 3 hours to complete the exam (1 hour for the mock)</p>\n<p>You will now see the exam page with the questions. All questions are on the same page and you can scroll up and down to access them.</p>\n<p>You’ll see a heading section containing summary information about the assessment, and there is a light blue horizontal bar containing a timer section and “Question completion status” section. Both sections can be expanded or collapsed by clicking small grey arrow symbols to the left of the section headings. You will see that the horizontal bar moves when scrolling through the questions, so it will remain visible at all times.</p>\n<p>The timer shows the remaining exam time in form of a progress bar and in actual minutes and seconds.</p>\n<p>The question completion status section indicates the questions you have and have not answered. By clicking on a specific question number you can navigate to this particular question.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Answering the questions</strong></p>\n<p>Before you start it is probably best to maximise the window by clicking the maximise symbol, in the top right corner of the Internet Explorer window.</p>\n<p>If you want to change to a larger font size you can change the magnification with the little symbol and drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the Internet Explorer window</p>\n<p>All exam questions are shown to you in a single window, and you can scroll up and down to look at all of them.</p>\n<p>In the exam you will get allocated reading time. During this time you are allowed to look at all questions and ask the invigilator if anything is unclear, but you are not allowed to start answering the questions, i.e. selecting any of the answers per mouse click.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you read every question and answer option thoroughly before answering. You answer a question by clicking your chosen option with the mouse.</p>\n<p>Note that for every question it is clearly indicated which area a question belongs to: Phonetics, Phonology, Syntax (including Morphology), Speech Science or Language Acquisition.</p>\n<p>After answering a question you should immediately save the answer by clicking the “save answer” button to the right of the question. After saving an answer you can change your mind as often as you want by simply selecting another option and then saving the answer again.</p>\n<p>Don’t panic if you inadvertently close the exam window or your browser crashes for some reason (highly unlikely) – ask for help from the invigilator during the exam if that happens. You will be able to restart the exam and your saved answers will be restored.</p>\n<p>Once you are happy with your answers you can submit your exam by clicking the “Save and Submit” button at the top or bottom of the exam page. This is the final step of the exam, and you won’t be able to return to it once you have submitted it. Clicking the “Save and Submit” button will display a pop-up window that provides you with the final option to cancel the submission process. This window will also alert you to any unanswered questions (but keep in mind that not answering questions is a possible option, you don’t have to answer all questions before submitting).</p>\n<p>Once you have clicked ‘ok’ on the pop-up window, your part of the examination is done.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Other useful information</strong></p>\n<p>You can go over the mock exam as often as you want, and you will see the overall score for your attempts, including detailed score for every question (you won’t see your score afterwards in the proper exam). Please make use of this! Being acquainted with the examination procedure might save you valuable time during the exam and will probably make you feel more relaxed too! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>On exam day</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check exam timetable for date, time and rooms beforehand!</li>\n<li>Bring your matriculation card!!!</li>\n<li>Bring something to drink and maybe snacks: The computer workshops are often rather hot and dry, and three hours is a long time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>Felix Schaeffler, 4th of December 2012</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>19.2 Invigilator Instructions for S4143 Online Exam</p>\n<p>S4143 – Invigilator announcements and instructions –Dec 2013</p>\n<p>Announcements (roughly 10 minutes before start of exam)</p>\n<p>a) Please display your matric. card on your desk throughout the exam</p>\n<p>b) No materials (books, calculators, web pages etc.) can be used.
