<p><span class="lead">13. Teaching and learning methods and strategies</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The MSc Hospitality Management and Leadership has been designed to incorporate good practice in the areas of learning, teaching and assessment. Modules will involve elements of inquiry (problem) based learning, while the assessment strategy both covers the breadth of types indicated in QAA and QMU masters benchmarks statements; while also focusing on integrating aspects of modular learning and assessment experiences. The programme will embed research led learning, by requiring students to examine contemporary hospitality management and leadership issues including; Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability; Authentic and Transformational Leadership; Community Engagement and Green Management.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Each of the modules on the programme will draw upon a wide selection of research, professional and industry examples, and contemporary textbooks, and students will be required to relate theory to practice through case studies, experiential activities, inquiry based approaches, web based reflective logs and seminars. Case studies used on the programme will address important topical issues and will draw upon an international context. Alongside the programme team, the programme will be supported by guest lectures from visiting academics and practitioners, and field trips.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The programme team have sought to ensure that module assessments link clearly to the aims and outcomes of the module as described within the module descriptors. A key aspect of integrative assessment has also been to look across the assessment contained within the programme as a whole to ensure that there is a good balance of assessment that exposes students to a wide variety of experiences; that the assessments are inclusive to the diverse student constituency, fair, relevant and reliable and that the assessment responds well to the needs of students.</p>

<p><span class="lead">15. Programme structures and features, curriculum units (modules), credits and award requirements (including any periods of placement)</span></p>
<p>The MSc International Hospitality Management and Leadership programme is a 12 month programme designed as a type 2 (career entry) general masters course, primarily for students with little or no business, management or leadership experience. It is a modular programme, with a single module credited with 15 points at SCQF level 11 (with one module being the community module). The programme has flexible exit points, with students who have taken the required number of credits able to exit with the award of postgraduate diploma. The programme is currently available in full-time mode. EASB will offer delivery of the MSc through 4 intakes a year,. Entry point into the programme will be at the beginning of a 3 month Term, normally these are; February, May, July, and October.</p>
<p>An overview and a summary of the structure of the MSc is presented in Table 1. The following delivery schedule reflects that 2 modules will be taken in each Term, alongside the CIP module that will be run by grouping students by term entry point. The CIP module therefore becomes a capstone module for each intake, and provides a focus for induction and integration of each particular group.</p>

<p>The programme has incorporated and closely follows the most up to date version of the equivalent module delivery at QMU. All modules are credited with 15 points and the Project module (CIP) with 60 credits. The CIP module is seen as creating a capstone experience within the programmes and offers the opportunity to both integrate the wider modular learning programme, develop a substantial piece of original work (in an external setting) and reflect on the project, the academic year and the students PDP for the future.</p>

<p>The regulations for Admission on to the MBA programme through various routes are located on the Quality website <a href="/about-the-university/quality/" title="QMU Website Quality page">QMU Website </a>. These regulations provide the framework for management of the admission of students onto academic programmes, for the progression of students through the programmes and their various exit points. An overview of some of the key elements of the admissions process follows and will specifically address:</p>

<li>Equal opportunities</li>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>International Management and leadership with Hospitality applicants should normally hold an honours degree or equivalent and non business related subjects are considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Market research has highlighted the widening range and evolution of entry criteria that has occurred in both the UK and overseas markets (Identified and discussed in the market research sub section). For example, Cardiff University is now to consider applications “from recent graduates with an Honours degree from an approved university or those with a similar level of qualification gained by other methods.” Additionally, the acceptance of candidates with professional qualifications and substantive business experience is increasing as an entry route especially evident in specialist, industry specific, awards such as MBA Hospitality Management in Singapore.</p>
<p>The team and school have spent an extensive amount of time researching, analysing and debating the entry criteria and changes to the market place. One of the primary influencers has been the changing ‘student’ within the higher education sector. This has been balanced with the clear differentiator of an MBA type qualification. This being the need to bring ‘relevant work experience on which the learning process should build.’ (QAA Guidelines 2015). It is clear that many current/recent graduates are leaving University with substantive work experience and in many cases substantive management experience. It is also important to note that within the Universities admissions criteria section 5.0 the guidelines note: [ broken link ]</p>

<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Based on the market research and analysis of the market place and in line with the Universities guidelines we would welcome applications from candidates who have no formal degree level qualification but can demonstrate substantive professional experience and suitable CPD outcomes, graduates with an undergraduate general degree level qualification who are able to bring and demonstrate substantive work experience/responsibility that will enhance the learning experience across the cohort and applicants who have obtained an undergraduate general degree level qualification but can demonstrate a period of postgraduate work experience and/or CPD.</p>
<p>Non standard entry applications would be considered on the basis of appropriate work experience and supporting CPD type activity, evidence of motivation to study at Masters level and supporting references.</p>
<p>Applicant profiles that fit with any of the described categories will therefore be seen under the universities normal working practices to have demonstrated equal competency and capability to enter the MBA programme.</p>
