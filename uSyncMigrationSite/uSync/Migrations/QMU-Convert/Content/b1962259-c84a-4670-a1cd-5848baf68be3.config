      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">About You</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Where are you from?</span></p>
<p>I am originally from Glasgow but moved to Fife over five years ago.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose QMU?</span></p>
<p>I chose QMU as the University started offering a degree in paramedic science in 2020, and I knew this course would allow me to start the journey towards my dream job as a paramedic. The University itself was a bonus, as the atmosphere is so welcoming, and you feel like you're part of a community here.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How did you hear about QMU?</span></p>
<p>My sister, who went to Edinburgh Napier to study nursing, told me that QMU was starting a paramedic science course and that the University has a great reputation.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">The Course</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What was it that interested you in the course?</span></p>
<p>Helping people is what motivates me to get up every day, and to be a paramedic means I can do that every day as a career. The content and structure of the course is great, and the lecturers are amazing! The course also includes placements which are an amazing opportunity to learn directly from experienced healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What were you doing before you came to QMU?</span></p>
<p>I was studying at Fife College gaining my HNC in Care and Administrative Practice, while working part-time to save up for university. This equipped me with a qualification that was recognised by QMU for the BSc Paramedic Science course and I was delighted to be accepted onto the degree programme.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What have you enjoyed about the paramedic course so far?</span></p>
<p>If I am being honest, I have enjoyed every single bit so far. I loved the fact that we dived straight into learning, and it has been non-stop ever since. Every day is a new day to learn something new and expand your knowledge even further. My peers have been a bonus and I love meeting others that share the same passion as I do. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What are you most looking forward to as the course develops?</span></p>
<p>I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge and confidence, and to going out on placements and applying my skills in practical settings.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What do you love about Edinburgh?</span></p>
<p>I love being so close to the city, as the train from QMU into the city centre is a 6-minute journey so it's literally on my doorstep. Due to the COVID-19 restrictions I haven't been able to go into Edinburgh as much as I would have liked. However, my University has worked very hard to help us continue to have a great student experience with online learning and some face to face learning, as well as good support and socially distanced social engagement opportunities. </p>
<p>The atmosphere in Edinburgh is great. It’s a wonderful place to enjoy student life, as the city really does offer something for everyone.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What do you enjoy about living in student residences?</span></p>
<p>I love that I was able to meet incredible people, to live with them, and now have amazing bonds. I always jump at the opportunity to meet other people, and choosing to live in student residences was the best decision I have made. You get to meet different people from different backgrounds which is so eye opening. The Res Life team has been amazing here at QMU and has always kept us busy despite the restrictions. The Res Life team organises loads of online events and has made the experience of living in halls more memorable.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">The Student Experience</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What are your top tips for anyone coming to QMU?</span></p>
<p>My top tips would be to live in student residences if you can, as you get to meet so many people and it adds to the university experience. Also, to feel at ease and please don't stress too much, university isn't that scary and the support here at QMU is incredible. You truly are never alone and there are people here to talk to if you ever did feel lonely. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What have been your best moments so far?</span></p>
<p>This is so hard to think of some as I feel I have too many! </p>
<p>One of them would have been St Andrew’s Day - QMU had bagpipes outside with people dancing, it was such a nice atmosphere to be around and to see people having fun.</p>
<p>Also for my 21st recently, we decorated the whole student flat for an early St Patrick's Day. We had loads of balloons, games, cake, and we all got dressed up.</p>]]></Value>
