      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Whilst studying for a BA (Hons) International Hospitality and Tourism (2011 – 2015) at QMU, he got involved in many different things which helped to bolster his CV, develop new skills, enhance his social life and improve his confidence.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic about taking every opportunity to engage in university life and gain work experience, Calum became one of the most well-known students within the QMU community. By the time of graduation, he had built an impressive CV having worked at a wealth of university corporate events, held a shift supervisor’s position with the student accommodation team and worked at several external hospitality events. Calum had also spent time working with the Dakota Hotel and volunteering at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games – an opportunity offered to him through his degree course. Calum was also one of the dedicated student team who cooked and served a five course banquet to legendary chef Albert Roux during his visit to QMU. </p>
<p>QMU was known by his lecturers as one of the hardest working and engaged students they had ever had in the department. His efforts paid off when he achieved a first class degree in 2015. QMU’s Students Union also awarded him the title of ‘QMU’s Most Engaged Student’.</p>
<p>Since graduating from QMU, Calum has enjoyed working for several high end hospitality organisations. He worked for a season on the Royal Belmont Scotsman, a luxury train which offers world class cuisine and thrilling excursions. During his time on the train he met many interesting people including Prue Leith, QMU’s new Chancellor and judge of the Great British Menu. He enjoyed serving Prue and her new husband whilst they enjoyed their honeymoon travelling through the Highlands. Calum is now working at the world-renowned Scottish restaurant in Skye, The Three Chimneys. The establishment offers 5-star accommodation and and stunning views over Loch Dunvegan.</p>]]></Value>
