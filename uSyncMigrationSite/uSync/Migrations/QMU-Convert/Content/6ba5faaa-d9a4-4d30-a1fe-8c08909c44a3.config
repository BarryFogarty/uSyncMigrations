<p>The aim of this parking policy is to support the University Green Travel Plan Strategy. The Green Travel Plan Strategy commits the University to promoting sustainable travel and reducing the detrimental effects of greenhouse gas emissions arising from transportation.</p>
<p>The adoption of this parking policy encourages all users of the University campus to consider active travel and low carbon alternatives to sole occupancy car journeys. It also supports the utilisation of more efficient and lower carbon vehicles through emissions based permits. A robust parking strategy is a recognised mechanism for road traffic reduction <em>(Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997) </em>and a major influence on travel choice.</p>
<p>The management of vehicle parking at the University is an important part of the process. The policy is designed to ensure that private vehicle use on campus is regulated and controlled to support health, safety and environmental intentions of the University.</p>
<p>The main aims of this policy are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>encourage sustainable travel choices</li>
<li>ensure that traffic and travel to and from the QMU campus is undertaken in an environmentally responsible manner.</li>
<li>discourage one-person car commuting, where reasonable alternatives are available</li>
<li>ensure the safety of road and car park users</li>
<li>enhance surveillance, control, and management of car parks through sanctions, for breach of the rules and regulations specified in this policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy will ensure that resources for car and other vehicle parking are used to maximum efficiency, and will be as fair as possible to staff and students, to the benefit of the whole University community.</p>
<p>The policy will administered by the Campus Operations department.</p>]]></Value>

      "content": "<p><strong>2. General</strong></p>\n<p>Parking on the QMU campus within core periods is by permit only other than authorised visitors. The core periods are defined as between the hours of 0800 and 1730, Monday to Friday from 1 September to 31 May.</p>\n<p>Permits charges are levied in line with the vehicle’s emissions, and will be applied for online via the University Parking Management System portal. </p>\n<p>Payment will be required where charges are applicable before the permit comes into effect, and can be made online via the portal.</p>\n<p>No permit will be issued to anyone who has an outstanding Parking Charge Notice (PCN).</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 Classes of permits</strong></p>\n<p>In the case of applications for disabled parking permits the process defined in 2.1.2 will apply.</p>\n<p>All other staff and students will be allocated permits based solely on need, following a process of criteria analysis, covering distance from campus, availability of public transport and child care or other caring responsibilities.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, such as shift workers there will be a shift permit paid for and retained by the department, in recognition of the lower frequency of public transport provision during certain times of day.</p>\n<p>General student parking is not available to students living in the on-site student residences and they must not bring cars onto the campus, during the core periods of permit operation. In exceptional circumstances students in halls of residence may be allocated a permit e.g. on course-related or medical grounds where supported by appropriate evidence.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1.1 Designated Parking Spaces</strong></p>\n<p>Disabled Parking spaces are solely for use of blue badge holders and authorised disabled users. Anyone not displaying a blue badge or a valid disabled permit will received a parking charge notice.</p>\n<p>Electric Car Charging spaces are solely for the use of electric cars actively charging their vehicle for a maximum period of 4 hours.</p>\n<p>Motorcycle Parking spaces are solely for the use of motorcycles. Motorcycles must not occupy a car parking space.</p>\n<p>Permit holders will not be allocated a parking space, and the issue of a parking permit does not constitute a guarantee of a space. There will be no <em>designated </em>spaces for any member of staff, other than those marked for disabled permit holders, and may on occasion be reserved for temporarily disabled staff or students, and also for visiting groups. These will be identified by Campus Operations staff as required.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1.2 Disabled Parking Permits</strong></p>\n<p>Queen Margaret University is committed to ensuring that disabled staff and students are able to access the University campus and are not discriminated against, in accordance with The Equality Act.</p>\n<p>Staff and students who hold a valid Blue Badge holders may park in disabled parking spaces on campus, however they must apply for a disabled parking permit via the University parking management system. As part of this process, a copy of the applicants Blue Badge must be submitted as supporting evidence. Once this criteria is met, a zero cost permit will be issued.</p>\n<p>Staff and students who do not hold a Blue Badge but still require a permit based on a long term or temporary physical impairment or disability, can apply for a disabled parking permit by contacting Student Services (students) or Health, Safety &amp; Wellbeing Team via HR (staff). Once approved by the applicable department, a disabled permit must be applied for via the parking management system. After suitable checks are undertaken, a disabled parking permit will be issued at zero cost. </p>\n<p>QMU has a commitment to ensure that people who have disabilities have every possible assistance in accessing QMU premises for the purpose of academic study and employment. Disabled parking bays are located as near as possible to the most appropriate entrance of the various buildings, having due regard for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>restriction and directives of current legislation</li>\n<li>the health and safety of persons who have mobility impairments and other users of the premises</li>\n<li>the numbers of people requiring to use the facilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no limit on the number of parking spaces allocated for people who have disabilities, but the allocation will, as a minimum, comply with relevant legislation. Wherever possible, new members of staff or new students who qualify for a disabled parking permit should, if possible, be identified prior to commencing employment or study, and should indicate requirement for parking space.</p>\n<p>Disabled parking permits will be issued at zero cost subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Permits issued are for the benefit of the person who has the disability only and are not transferable. (it is acceptable for the permit to be used by a carer when supporting a staff member / student with a disability)</li>\n<li>Permit holders should park in the designated disabled bays wherever possible.</li>\n<li>The permit must be clearly displayed on the dashboard within the front windscreen of the user's car.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parking for visitors to the University who hold a valid Blue Badge is free. However, as the car park is managed by automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, visitors who hold a valid Blue Badge must register their vehicle at the main reception on arrival in order to obtain this concession for the duration of their visit. Failure to register will lead to a parking charge notice being issued.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1.3 Inadequate public transport</strong></p>\n<p>Points will be allocated to a journey of more than 5 miles from home to campus, which cannot be made, without excessive difficulty, on public transport. Excessive difficulty is where more than 3 different services would be required to make the journey, or where the public transport option would take 45 minutes more than the same journey by car.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1.4 Family commitment</strong></p>\n<p>If it is essential for a member of staff or a student to transport a young child or children to nursery/school, or where it is necessary to be at home at a certain time for childcare purposes and there is no alternative means other than the car, they will be eligible for points.</p>\n<p>Consideration will also be given to those with care responsibilities of an adult dependent relative. Permits are allocated by a cumulative points system, which should mean that those in the greatest need will be most likely to qualify for a permit.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1.5 Essential Business user</strong></p>\n<p>An essential business user (EBU) is a member of staff whose duties require <strong>extensive </strong>offsite travel, that is, virtually every day. Nomination as an essential user will be contingent upon verifiable data supplied by the departments and on request of Campus Operations. Essential user permits are charged at £100 which cost will be borne by the user’s department.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Visitor and non-permit holder parking within core periods</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.2.1 Conferences and other ticketed events</strong></p>\n<p>A limited allocation of parking may be accommodated with advance notice for conferences and other ticketed events. Attendees should contact the organiser to find out if there are any agreed special arrangements for parking. The organiser is responsible for providing vehicle registration details to Campus Operations at least 7 days prior to the event start date to ensure parking can be accommodated. If no parking arrangements have been made in advance the daily parking rate will apply and attendees will be required to pay to park via the PayByPhone app, website or by telephone.</p>\n<p>Any gathering of visitors that is not a meeting will require event planning, please ensure that you have consulted with the Health, Safety and Wellbeing Team before you make hard and fast plans, e.g. for a large number of vehicles a car park marshal and additional signage may be required.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2.2 Registered visitors</strong></p>\n<p>Visitors who have been registered on the University’s visitor management system are eligible to park free providing the host staff member registers the visitor’s vehicle registration number on the visitor management system at least 24 hours’ notice prior to arrival. Where parking is not pre-arranged the visitor will be required to pay the daily parking rate via the PayByPhone app, website or by telephone.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2.3 Unregistered visitors</strong></p>\n<p>Visitors who are not registered on the visitor management system will be required to pay the daily parking rate via the PayByPhone app, website or by telephone. Using these options automatically registers the vehicle's number plate within the University's parking management system.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2.4 Non-permit holder staff and students</strong></p>\n<p>Staff and students who do not hold a valid permit will be required to pay to park via the PayByPhone app, website or by telephone. Using these options automatically registers the vehicle's number plate within the University's parking management system. The daily parking rate will apply.</p>\n<p>The University reserves the right to determine the availability of parking to non-permit holders on any given day taking account of regular permit usage, events and visitor numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2.5 Visiting lecturers</strong></p>\n<p>Visiting lectures are a distinct group of staff. They should contact their School to request parking. If approved, Schools may register the visiting lecture’s vehicle on the visitor management system with at least 24 hours’ notice. Schools may require visiting lectures to apply for parking permits. Where Schools do not wish to do so, the cost of their parking will be calculated using the department’s timetable, and charged to the School at the beginning of the semester. The cost will be charged at the applicable daily parking rate. Visiting lectures will be informed about QMU's Green Travel policy and encouraged to use other forms of transport than cars whenever possible.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2.6 Defined permits</strong></p>\n<p>Essential Business Users (EBU) whose role changes and no longer involves the level of off-campus travel that necessitated the EBU permit must surrender the permit and make a personal application under the regular staff criteria.</p>\n<p>Persons who have had a temporary health or fitness impairment that has necessitated a disabled permit issued by the University, should also reapply for a regular permit once they no longer have the impairment and the temporary disabled permit has been withdrawn.</p>\n<p>Additionally, and by prior arrangement, permission may be given for collection/delivery of bulky items e.g. uplifting of teaching resources, scripts for marking etc., in which case these items must be deposited at the mail room for collection. These can then be collected by car which will be allowed to stop in the service area for the purpose. Drivers must not leave their vehicles unattended in this situation, and will need to notify security as they leave.</p>\n<p><strong>2.3 Appeals</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.3.1 Refusal of Permit</strong></p>\n<p>Appeals in relation to non-allocation of a parking permit shall be made online via the University Parking Permit System portal. Each appeal shall be independently adjudicated by managers within the Campus Services division. Whilst appeals are being processed parking within the car park is not permitted until the appeal is concluded.</p>\n<p>Appeals shall require verifiable supporting evidence for consideration of special circumstances. Staff adjudicating appeals may undertake reasonable enquires to determine the appeal.</p>\n<p><strong>2.3.2 Parking Charge Notice</strong></p>\n<p>Appeals must follow the guidance provided by Open Parking in relation to contacting the relevant authority. Appeals will be reviewed using any evidence gathered as well as the CCTV to review each case.</p>\n<p>The outcome of any appeal will be final and there will be no further route of appeal.</p>\n<p><strong>2.4 Permit costs</strong></p>\n<p>Revenue generated from the permit charges and parking charge notices will be utilised to fund the costs of managing the scheme and the implementation and support of other Green Travel Plan Strategy measures.</p>\n<p>Charges for permits will be reviewed annually and are set out in schedule 1 of the policy.</p>\n<p>A student or staff member surrendering their parking permit for any reason may request a refund by applying to <a href=\"mailto:parking@qmu.ac.uk\">parking@qmu.ac.uk</a> Permit refunds are prorated by month and no refunds will be issued on permits that are within 90 days of expiration.</p>\n<p>Part-time staff may be eligible for a proportional discount based on their contracted hours.</p>\n<p>Parking outside the core periods will not require a permit. Cars left in the car park overnight, must be removed by 8am or they will be subject to a parking charge notice. Vehicles left in the car park for more than ten days without the appropriate permit will be removed, and cost for removal accrued to vehicle owner as defined by DVLA.</p>\n<p>All permits will be subject to an annual application process via the University Parking Management System portal. Once registered via their QMU e-mail address users will be able to utilise their account on an on-going basis.</p>\n<p><strong>2.5 How to apply</strong></p>\n<p>All applications shall be made online utilising the University Parking Management System portal and will be administered on behalf of the University by a registered Independent Parking Committee or British Parking Association parking provider.</p>\n<p>Applications should be made annually during late August for the following academic session. Exact timings and deadlines will be published on the parking section of the University website annually. </p>\n<p>In all cases, evidence will be requested to support the application. The vehicle registration document and a council tax statement / recent utility bill / rental agreement showing term time address will be required, along with evidence of caring responsibilities or medical conditions.</p>"
