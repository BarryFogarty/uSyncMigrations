      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Now that we have entered a new period of temporary lockdown, schools, early learning and nursery services are once again closed other than for children of key workers and vulnerable children. We are conscious that staff with children will again be facing challenges with balancing work with child care and home schooling responsibilities.</p>
<p>Whether your role involves some on campus presence or you are continuing to work entirely from home, we recognise that it may be difficult for those with young children to carry out their full range of responsibilities during their normal working hours and/or to work a full working day. We will continue to provide full pay to all staff in this position, and in return we would ask that staff, where possible, exercise a degree of flexibility.</p>
<p>Further details on the University’s arrangements for staff working from home with caring responsibilities can be found within the following document, COVID-19 Leave and Special Arrangement Guidance Table Please speak to your Head of Division/Service if you have any concerns about your current working arrangements.</p>
<p>This approach differs from our normal arrangements for Emergency Leave for Care of Dependents and further details can be found in the Special Leave Policy</p>
<p>We recognise that some members of staff may wish to take additional annual leave to allow them to fulfil childcare commitments, and we can confirm that line managers will be as flexible as possible in responding to any such requests.</p>
<p>In addition we also recognise that some members of staff may also need time off work to help someone who depends on them (a ‘dependant’) in an unexpected event or emergency. This could apply to situations related to coronavirus. A dependant does not necessarily live with the member of staff, for example they could be an elderly relative who relies on support and help and the member of staff may need to go out and see their relative in their home during the working day.</p>
<p>School and nursery closures</p>
<p>School and nursery closures The school and nursery closures, with the exception of teaching children of key workers, will have an effect on care and working arrangements, acknowledging that given the current circumstances ‘the workplace’ is currently home for most of us. This may be an anxious time for parents in terms of childcare and home schooling.</p>
<p>We would encourage all members of staff to keep in regular dialogue with their line manager and their colleagues and consider adding a suitable out of office message to manage expectations around availability which may be more limited at this time.</p>
<p>Areas to consider:</p>
<p>• Find a suitable place to work while being close to your children to supervise them. Having a set work space helps all the family to know you’re working.</p>
<p>• Take regular breaks to rest and relax.</p>
<p>• Whilst it’s important to have routine and structure, be prepared to adapt and be flexible to suit your family needs.</p>
<p>• Working flexibly and not necessarily within normal working hours or days.</p>
<p>• If you and your partner are both working at home, consider planning time if one is attending a remote meeting and the other is looking after the children, or if there is no one to share the childcare plan in some school work, tv or tablet time.</p>
<p>• Try working once you have set up your children with their school activities provided by the school.</p>
<p>• Try not to have meetings which last too long to allow you to give your children regular attention and provide snacks and drinks.</p>
<p>• Ensure that your children take time for exercise.</p>
<p>• Introduce your children to your work colleagues if you want and need to and remember that many people are dealing with a similar situation.</p>
<p>• Remember it’s acceptable if you need to pause or leave a meeting to attend to your children especially if they are younger or you have children with additional needs.</p>
<p>• Try where possible to keep to a structure for your day.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges can be supervising children appropriately. Some older children can be left on their own but younger children and babies cannot. When your children need you, take time off and return to your tasks later. Give yourself permission to take care of your family and don’t feel guilty for doing so.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember this is a worrying time for everyone and very often unusual and challenging times are often the most memorable. We need to ensure that children have fond memories of all this time that we are currently spending at home, whilst at the same time managing how the children are coping with the news and the wider situation across the world.</p>]]></Value>
