<p>She was known to be a fine scholar with a formidable intellectual capacity, who often debated the affairs of state with the King's noble and clerical advisers. As a deeply religious woman, Queen Margaret was concerned with works of mercy and giving and particularly with the care of the poor.</p>
<p>Among many charitable works she established a ferry across the Firth of Forth for pilgrims travelling to St Andrews in Fife. This gave the towns of South Queensferry and North Queensferry their names.</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is the only Scottish university to have a royal title. The name Queen Margaret was incorporated into the institution’s title in 1972 because the venerated 11th century queen personified the institution’s key values of serving the community and enhancing quality of life.</p>
