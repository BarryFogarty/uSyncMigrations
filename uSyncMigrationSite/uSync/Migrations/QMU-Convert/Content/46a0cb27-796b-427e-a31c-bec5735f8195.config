<p>It is mandatory for all Universities in Scotland to collect information about relevant criminal convictions and live criminal proceedings (charges). We collect this at the post-offer stage and annually on re-enrolment. This allows us to assess risk and maintain a safe and secure environment at QMU.</p>
<p>For certain courses applicants must declare all criminal convictions and in these cases the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. We use this information to assess suitability for certain courses. This information enables us to measure risk and ensure we are safeguarding children and vulnerable adults. We may sometimes be required to disclose this information to competent authorities.</p>

<p>As an international organisation, the University may need to process your personal information in a country other than the one you are studying in, when this is necessary to provide you with academic and support services, meet a legal obligation, fulfil a contract with you, or where we have your consent.</p>

<ul>
<li>Managing collaborations with overseas educational institutions including student exchanges and partnership programmes.</li>
<li>Working with overseas recruitment agencies.</li>
<li>Information posted on our website which is accessible outside the EEA.</li>

<p><strong>Profiling or automated decision making</strong></p>
<p>We do not use profiling or automated decision-making processes. Some processes are semi-automated but a human decision maker will always be involved before any decision is reached in relation to you.</p>

<p><strong>Survey Responses</strong></p>
<p>QMU collects data through student surveys. The information collected in surveys is pseudonymised and stored against a unique personal identifier. Anonymous aggregated reports are shared more widely. Information entered in free text boxes may indirectly identify a student. Where this is the case we go to reasonable lengths to redact any information that acts as an identifier before sharing the results more widely. We encourage students to be cautious of what they enter so as not to identify themselves. Survey results are shared with Deans, Heads of Division and Programme Leads in order that feedback can be acted on.</p>
