<p><strong>Opinion</strong></p>
<p>We have audited the financial statements of Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh (‘the parent institution’) and its subsidiary (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 July 2020 which comprise the Statements of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure, Statements of Changes in Reserves, Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statement of Cashflows and the related notes 1 to 24, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).</p>
<p>In our opinion, the financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>give a true and fair view of the group’s and of the parent institution’s state of affairs as at 31 July 2020 and of the group and parent institution’s income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and changes in reserves and of the group’s statement of cash flows for the year then ended;</li>
<li>have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;</li>
<li>have been properly prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further and Higher Education, and relevant legislation; and</li>
<li>have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and regulation 14 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basis for opinion</strong></p>
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent institution in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.</p>
<p>We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.</p>
<p>Emphasis of matter – Disclosure in relation to the effects of Covid-19 and Property, Plant and Equipment</p>
<p>We draw attention to the Statement of Principal Accounting Policies (Note A) on pages 22-23 of the financial statements, which describes the financial and operational consequences the University is facing as a result of Covid-19 which is impacting the financial and operational position and performance during 2020/21 and beyond.</p>
<p>We also draw attention to the Statement of Principal Accounting Policies (Note N) on pages 26 and 27 of the financial statements, which describe the valuation uncertainty the University is facing as a result of Covid-19 in relation to property valuations.</p>
<p>Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.</p>
<p>Conclusions relating to going concern</p>
<p>We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the University Court’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or</li>
<li>the University Court has not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group’s or the parent institution’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other information</strong></p>
<p>The other information comprises the information included in the Strategic Report and Financial Statements, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The University Court is responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.</p>
<p>We have nothing to report in this regard.</p>
<p>Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006</p>
<p>In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:</p>
<ul>
<li>the information given in the Strategic Report and Financial Statements, which includes the directors’ report and the strategic report prepared for the purpose of company law, for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared, is consistent with the financial statements; and</li>
<li>the strategic report and the directors’ report included within the Strategic Report and Financial Statements, have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Scottish Funding Council's Financial Memorandum with Higher Education Institutions</p>
<p>In our opinion, in all material respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>the requirements of the Scottish Funding Council’s accounts direction have been met;</li>
<li>funds from whatever source administered by the institution for specific purposes have been applied properly to those purposes and, if relevant, managed in accordance with relevant legislation, and any other terms and conditions attached to them; and</li>
<li>funds provided by Scottish Funding Council have been applied in accordance with the requirements of the Scottish Funding Council Financial Memorandum with Higher Education Institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Matters on which we are required to report by exception</strong></p>
<p>In light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have identified no material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report included within the Strategic Report and Financial Statements.</p>
<p>We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Accounts (Scotland) regulations 2006 (as amended) requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>adequate and proper accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or</li>
<li>the parent institution financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or</li>
<li>certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or</li>
<li>we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of the University Court</strong></p>
<p>As explained more fully in the Responsibilities of the University Court set out on page 15, the University Court (who are also the directors of the parent institution for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the University Court determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</p>
<p>In preparing the financial statements, the University Court is responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent institution’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the University Court either intends to liquidate the group or the parent institution or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements</strong></p>
<p>We have been appointed as auditor under section 44(1)(c) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and under the Companies Act 2006 and report in accordance with the Acts and relevant regulations made or having effect thereunder.</p>
<p>Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.</p>
<p>A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.</p>
<p><strong>Use of our report</strong></p>
<p>This report is made solely to the University Court of Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 in accordance with regulation 10 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (as amended). Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the University Court those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh and the University Court as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.</p>
<p>Stephen Reid (Senior statutory auditor)</p>
<p>for and on behalf of Ernst &amp; Young LLP, Statutory Auditor</p>
<p>Edinburgh</p>
<p>26 February 2021</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>1. The maintenance and integrity of Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh’s web site is the responsibility of the University Court; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site</p>
<p>2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.</p>]]></Value>
