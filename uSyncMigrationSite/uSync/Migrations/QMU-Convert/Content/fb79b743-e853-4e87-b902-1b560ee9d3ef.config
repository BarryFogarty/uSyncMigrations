<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>To provide a programme of study that develops a sound understanding of the issues and concepts related to dietetics: health, well-being and disease at individual, community and population levels.</li>
<li>To develop the ability to integrate contributory disciplines in the analysis and interpretation of factors influencing the maintenance or improvement of health and disturbance of the body’s functions in relation to disease.</li>
<li>To develop in students the capacity for critical, analytical, reflective and independent thinking so that they become effective problem solvers and continuing learners both as students and in their subsequent careers.</li>
<li>To encourage a research mindedness on the part of students so that they may better understand and evaluate relevant research, compare merits of alternative hypotheses and be able to undertake research themselves and in turn contributing to evidence based practice to support clinical intervention.</li>
<li>To facilitate the progressive development in students of a range of transferable skills relevant to the world of work including methods of communication, the commitment to life-long learning and a professional and ethical approach to working</li>
<li>To develop experimental and practical skills related to their field of study with associated skills in design of investigations, data collection, analysis and reporting.</li>
<li>To develop a student whose approach is proactive and flexible, has the ability to work within a diverse and multi-professional domain and can recognise and respond positively to changing needs or demographics.</li>
<li>To develop a student who has the ability to work as, and be recognised, as a competent clinical dietician</li>

<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>A variety of teaching and learning approaches are utilised which are tailored to the level of study, the specific learning outcomes of the module and the content of the module. They aim to ensure that the appropriate development of knowledge and transferable skills occurs. Approaches used through the programme include lectures, tutorials, laboratories, workshops, case studies, role play, problem based learning, patient simulations, on line discussions via Moodle, practice placements (competency based practice) and undertaking research/audit projects. Both directed and self directed work (individual and group) are utilised with the aim of developing a student centred and student led approach. Transferable skills are developed such as written and verbal communication, IT, presentation skills, research and dissemination skills, portfolio management and reflective practice.</p>

<p><span class="lead">16. Criteria for admission</span></p>
<p>Admissions to the course are carried out by a selection committee consisting of the Director of the College, the Programme Leader and selected course tutors. Final decisions are made by the selection committee.</p>
<p>All Applicants should have a Lyceum certificate with a grade of 10 or above. Admissions staff will focus on Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Essay Writing grades as more relevant to the course. Applicants must achieve a grade of 10/20 in respect of English language. <span style="font-size: 14px;">Applicants with serious </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">criminal convictions, notably those convicted of violence, sexual or drug offences, may be excluded from entry.</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is available to applicants with other qualifications including the IVT diploma. Qualifications are mapped against the SCQF framework and curriculum content of the Dietetics programme and as such are dealt with on a case by case basis. IVT/IEK (both AMC and non-AMC) qualified Dietetic assistant applicants are offered an advanced entry to level 2 of the BSc (Hons) Dietetics programme).</p>
<p>The applicants will be accepted after a final interview which will take place during the enrolment period. The Programme leader and two tutors will discuss with the applicant regarding the reasons of choosing this programme of studies and this profession.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><em><strong>English Language Requirements for IVT direct entry students</strong></em><br />On admission to the programme “Applicants must be able to communicate in English to the standard equivalent of level 5.0 of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), with no element below 5.0.”</p>
<p>The first two years of the programme will be taught and assessed in Greek and that the 3rd and 4th year of the programme will be taught and assessed in English (with the exception of the placement blocks). Students’ competence in English should be of IELTS (score 6) or equivalent, in order to progress into the 3rd year</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><em><strong>Criminal Conviction Checks</strong></em><br />Applicants with serious criminal convictions, notable those convicted of violence, sexual or drug offences, may be excluded from programmes as they may be unable to undertake certain clinical education placements or find employment on completion of the programme. Exclusion should not however be automatic. Most ex-offenders are essentially law-abiding citizens and will not re-offend. In reaching a decision about an applicant, therefore, programme teams are asked to take into account the age, nature and relevancy of the conviction, the applicants’ attitude to it and his or her achievements since the conviction. Dependent on the case students may be admitted to the programme, but would be informed that, subsequent progression to practice placements and successful registration with the HPC via the International route cannot be guaranteed. Students will be responsible for and required to declare any criminal convictions during their period of registration. All applicants will be obliged to complete and sign the criminal convictions sector in the application form.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><em><strong>Health Screening</strong></em><br />All students admitted to the programme will undergo a formal Health Screen underpinned by an official medical certificate signed by a physician clarifying that they do not suffer from an infectious disease. Students are also advised that any changes in health that occur during the programme between these time points should be notified to the Programme Leader.</p>
<p>Students will be made aware on admission that where necessary and relevant any such information regarding health or criminal records may be disclosed to relevant third parties e.g. Practice Providers.</p>
<p>AMC in line with QMU is committed to the provision of a policy of equal opportunity in student selection. All applicants regardless of race, ethnic origins, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status or age, can expect equal treatment.</p>
