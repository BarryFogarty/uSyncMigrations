In recent years, he has worked on investigating health systems in fragile and conflict-affected settings in the Middle East and Africa, with a special attention to service delivery, political economy of health and health system governance. Dr Bou-Orm also led research projects to investigate cancer screening behaviours in Lebanon and the burden of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes as a high-burden disease in Lebanon and their risk factors. His research portfolio has relied on different research approaches and methods including systems thinking, health policy and political economy analysis as well as quantitative methods and mixed-methods. He is also affiliated to the UK-FCDO funded project ReBUILD for Resilience exploring health system resilience in fragile settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Active research interests: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health Systems in Fragile and Conflict-affected Settings</li>\n<li>Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Prevention and Control</li>\n<li>Universal Health Coverage and Primary Healthcare</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Research Methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participatory research methods</li>\n<li>Political economy analysis</li>\n<li>Quantitative methods</li>\n<li>Evidence synthesis</li>\n<li>Mixed-methods</li>\n</ul>"

It will generate evidence on the main sources of healthcare in the region and the interaction of communities with different sectors to address their health needs. The project builds on a growing collaborative work with UOSSM France and other partners in Northern Syria. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Exploring approaches for complementary private sector engagement in the health sector in Northern Syria </span></p>\n<p>In collaboration with UOSSM France, this project aims to explore more sustainable and long-term approaches to health service provision by engaging (or not) the private sector in the provision of health services. In addition to knowledge generation, this research grant would inform heath actors in the conflict zone of Syria about best practices to serve communities during this crisis and beyond.</p>\n<p>Learn more about this project <a href=\"https://www.rebuildconsortium.com/projects/private-sector-health-syria/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Assessment of the provision of Mental Health Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) services to health workers and community members in Northwest Syria</span></p>\n<p>Funded by WHO Europe, this project explored the responsiveness of MHPSS services towards host communities, internally displaced persons, and health care workers with a special focus on access to MHPSS care, as well as experiences of service users. This work also aimed to identify how to improve integration of services for better continuum of care, service efficiency and person-centeredness.</p>\n<p>A blog about a presentation of key findings is available <a href=\"https://www.rebuildconsortium.com/the-reality-of-mental-health-and-psychological-support-in-northwest-syria/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Rebuild for Resilience</span></p>\n<p>ReBUILD for Resilience examines health systems in fragile settings experiencing violence, conflict, pandemics and other shocks.
