      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong> Who can apply?  </strong></p>
<p>QMU Students who identify as female, in their 1st year of Undergraduate study at QMU (studying any subject).* <br />Demonstrates want, willingness and commitment to learning a 2nd language.  <br />Preference may be given to students from a widening access background (as defined by QMU) but applications from all backgrounds are welcomed.  </p>
<p>*Preference may be given to 1st-year Undergraduate students but direct entrants (those joining QMU directly in to 2nd or 3rd year) are encouraged to apply.  </p>
<p><strong>How many scholarships are available?</strong></p>
<p>There are up to 4 scholarships available.</p>
<p><strong>What do I receive as an Alison Scott Scholar? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Year 1 </strong></p>
<p>A premium subscription to the Babbel Learning Language App. </p>
<p><strong>Year 2 </strong></p>
<p>A premium subscription to the Babbel Learning Language App. <br />Access to live group or 121 online classes through the Babbel Learning Language App.  <br />Introduction to a female business/career mentor. </p>
<p><strong>Year 3 and 4 </strong></p>
<p>Continued access to language app and group or 121 online classes through Babble. <br />Continued mentoring. <br />Opportunity to apply for further funding to fund a trip abroad to attend a European international language school (c.4-6 weeks). <br />Support applying for graduate roles incl. applications, assessment centre and interview prep. </p>
<p><strong>How much time do I need to spend learning a language?  </strong></p>
<p>The expectation is to study your chosen language for an average of one-hour per week. Babbel is split into 15min bite-size learning, meaning this would average using the app for 15 mins 4 times per week. </p>
<p><strong>What languages can I study?  </strong></p>
<p>Spanish, German, French or Italian.  </p>
<p><strong>I have already started learning a language, can I still apply? </strong></p>
<p>Unless you are completely fluent at this language already, then we don’t see why not. The aim of the scholarship is to get our scholars to an intermediate level of fluency in time for you graduating. The Babble app allows you to start learning at your current level, whether that be a complete beginner or someone who knows some of the language already.  </p>
<p><strong>What is an international language school? </strong></p>
<p>An international language school is your chance to travel to a country that speaks your chosen language, and study this language (usually for 4-6 weeks). Example – If you are learning French, this would be attending a French Language School, in France.</p>
<p><strong>What is the application process and how do I apply? </strong></p>
<p>Step 1 – The 2023/24 Alison Scott Scholarship is now closed.</p>
<p>Step 2 – Shortlisted candidates will be invited to meet a small panel of QMU staff to chat about the scholarship and your reasons for applying. Applicants may also be asked for an academic reference. These will take place mid to late February.</p>
<p><strong>Does being a scholar guarantee me funding for an international language school? </strong></p>
<p>No. This is something that would likely be in your 3rd or 4th year of study, once you have a good grasp of the language.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to go to an international Language School?  </strong></p>
<p>No. Being an Alison Scott Scholar allows you access to apply for additional funding to attend an international language school. It is not a guarantee of funding, nor a condition that you must attend an international summer school. </p>
<p><strong>What is Babbel?  </strong></p>
<p>Babbel is a language learning app, offering users the chance to learn a language through their phone or tablet. The app offers courses at newcomer, beginner I, beginner II, pre-intermediate, and intermediate levels.  </p>
<p><strong>Who makes this scholarship possible?</strong></p>

They are a passionate advocate for change and widely recognised for their campaign for gender parity; having raised over a quarter of a million pounds for women’s charities across the UK; launched initiatives to better educate women &amp; girls and grow the female talent pipeline; and campaigned to promote &amp; encourage gender equity in private enterprise and public policy.</p>
