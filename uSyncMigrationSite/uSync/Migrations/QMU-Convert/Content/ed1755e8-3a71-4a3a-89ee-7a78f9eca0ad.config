      <Value><![CDATA[<p>he Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships scheme helps students undertake an independent research project in any academic field of study during the summer vacation. It is designed for third year students on a four year honours degree course or fourth year students on a five year honours degree course.</p>
<p><span>The scheme supports eligible students to develop valuable research skills, investigate a topic of particular interest and their academic writing. Scholarships can last between two and six weeks, supported by a grant of £250 per week from The Carnegie Trust.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.carnegie-trust.org/" title="Carnegie Trust">The Carnegie Trust</a> is a charitable organisation founded by Scots-American steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie, in 1901. For over a century, the Trust has funded student fees, scholarships, bursaries and research grants. It operates across all academic disciplines to encourage wider access to higher education and further research in Scottish universities. With annual funding of around £2.5 million, the Trust is one of the largest educational grant giving charities in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span>In previous years, BSc (Hons) Psychology, BSc (Hons) Public Sociology, BSc (Hons) Psychology &amp; Sociology, BSc (Hons) Applied Pharmacology, BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy and BSc (Hons) Occupational Therapy students from QMU have won Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships.</span></p>
<p><span>Susan Gray, 21, from South Lanarkshire, is a final year BSc (Hons) Psychology and Sociology student at QMU and was one of two students supported by the Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships scheme in 2017. The Scholarship enabled Susan to undertake research into ‘The Lived Experiences of Parents with Children on the Autistic Spectrum in Lanarkshire’. Commenting on how the Scholarship helped her, Susan said:</span></p>
<p><span>“As an advocate of neurodiversity, I believe that further action must be taken to ensure that society does not only have a stronger understanding of what autism is, but also an awareness of how it impacts the lives of families. Therefore, my Scholarship project was based upon a Photovoice research design, which offered a small group of parents of autistic children the opportunity to take photographs of places, spaces and objects, which illustrated their own lived experiences. </span></p>
<p><span>“In a subsequent focused group discussion and in a series of individuals interviews, participants shared their photographs and the stories which accompanied them. I'm now currently in the process of arranging an exhibition, so that these photographs can be displayed to an invited audience of community members and policy makers. </span></p>
<p><span>“Albeit, I’m lucky enough to have had both personal and professional experiences with some wonderful autistic individuals, I felt my academic knowledge of autism was somewhat limited and this would still be the case if I hadn't convinced myself to apply for the Scholarship with The Carnegie Trust. </span></p>
<p><span>“During the application process, I was a bit concerned that if I were to get granted a Carnegie Scholarship, it would interfere with my work commitments and that I wouldn’t be able to unwind after the stressful demands of my third year. However, I had plenty of time during the summer to do both as well as my scholarship research!</span></p>
<p><span>“To be able to conduct a research project, which has brought meaning to the experiences of inspiring individuals from within my own home community has been an invaluable experience. </span></p>
<p><span>“I'm certain that this process has also been beneficial in preparing me, both mentally and academically, for my dissertation project. Beginning my dissertation with an understanding of what was required definitely took away a lot anxiety I had about the project. Also, knowing how to prepare for and conduct interviews has been really beneficial! If you are eligible to apply for a Carnegie Scholarship, I would highly recommend it.”</span></p>
<p><span>QMU students should ask their Programme Leader for more information on making an application for The Carnegie Trust: Vacation Scholarships scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Applicants must be Scottish by birth, descent or residence and should submit their applications to Sheena Watson (School Manager for Arts, Social Sciences &amp; Management) E: <a href="mailto:swatson@qmu.ac.uk">swatson@qmu.ac.uk </a>or Jenny Ansett (School Manager for Health Sciences) E: <a href="mailto:jansett@qmu.ac.uk">jansett@qmu.ac.uk </a>by Monday 19th February 2018.</span></p>
