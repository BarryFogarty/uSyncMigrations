I have been overwhelmed with the support, the patience and the compassion they showed. From the initial start of the project to the videos, menu cards and the help creating and finding Irvings Bakery for our Biscuits – this has ultimately been not only the best experience personally but also for our families that we work with.
The experience was interactive and it was so amazing to work with a group of people, whose knowledge and insights were incredible but who were also fully invested in the vision Juniors had 
I only wish we could work together all the time!

Irvings could produce a great tasting product with flexible order quantities at a mutually agreeable price for the charity. The ginger biscuit was available in the desired pack size and could be rebranded with Juniors logo. Irvings and Lesley were introduced during the project and were able to build a relationship for on-going business.</p>\n<p>Concept ideas for the recipe cards were discussed and refined by SCFDI and Lesley. The SCFDI then created and photographed each recipe in the development kitchen at QMU.</p>\n<p>The SCFDI and Lesley set up a focus group with the target audience at Juniors play cafe in Hamilton to gather feedback on drafted recipe cards and discuss potential barriers to cooking. During the visit the team provided knowledge transfer of nutritional facts about seasonal fruit and vegetables. The Juniors café chef provided two additional customer favourite recipes which the SCFDI added to the selection of recipe cards.</p>"

For five of these recipes short, follow-along voiceover videos were created for sharing on Juniors various social media platforms to ensure the recipes are accessible to all.</p>"

They are also currently available in various businesses and local market stalls, raising more revenue for the charity.</p>\n<p>The recipe cards have been given out to Juniors play café customers and local nurseries. Feedback Lesley has gotten on so far on the recipe cards, parents and children cooking the meals together, the recipes are quick and easy to make and parents are adapting their recipes to personal preferences. Sainsbury’s have donated cooking equipment to low-income families to help support families cooking meals at home.</p>"

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Lesley Robertson, founder of Juniors Play Café in Hamilton, supports low-income families and those effected by food poverty via charity ‘Families Like Us’. Lesley sought the assistance of the <a href="http://www.qmu.ac.uk/SCFDI">Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation</a> (SCFDI), to source a snack which could be branded as Juniors and sold to commercial partners – diversifying the income stream of the charity. Lesley also required assistance creating healthy and cost-effective recipe cards for the South Lanarkshire community.</p>
<p>The project was funded via a Standard Innovation Voucher from the Scottish Funding Council, coordinated by Interface.  The SCFDI have expertise in formulation development, nutrition, product costings and have connections to manufacturers in the food industry.</p>
<p>The project resulted in introducing Lesley to Irvings Bakery, based in Castle Douglas, who agreed to manufacture ginger biscuits packs with the Juniors brand,  increasing the awareness of the brand and consequently the charity. The project also resulted in the creation of nine cost effective recipe cards with nutritional facts about fruit and vegetables and five supplementary step by step videos for social media.</p>
<p>The project created a new revenue stream for the charity, increased the awareness of Juniors, increased business for Irvings, increased nutrition knowledge and encouraged home cooking in the local community.</p>]]></Value>
