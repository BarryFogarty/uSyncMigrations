      "content": "<p><strong><span class=\"lead-big\">For students:</span><br /></strong><span class=\"lead\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Why is industrial action being taken?</strong></p>\n<p>The University and College Union (UCU) has called for industrial action nationally over what it regards as universities' failure to make improvements on pay and working conditions. Queen Margaret University is part of a national bargaining arrangement which determines pay across most of the UK university sector. The 2022/23 pay settlement from 1 August 2022 was an uplift of amounts up to 9% for staff on the lowest pay spine points, and an increase of 3% for staff on or above spine point 20. Unions have called for an increase to all spine points on the national pay scale of RPI (RPI was 12.6% in September 2022) + 2%, or 12%, whichever is the higher.</p>\n<p>Within the sector, nationally agreed pay awards are implemented on an annual basis, with effect from 1st August at the start of the respective year. On that basis, the 2023-24 pay offer, of between 8% and 5%, depending on individual staff salary points, has also been implemented. To reflect cost of living pressures, a proportion of this offer was applied early, with effect from 1st February 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Can Queen Margaret University resolve the pay dispute by giving staff more money?</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>No. Trade unions, including UCU, and the organisations which represent university employers, undertake national collective bargaining to agree pay settlements.</p>\n<p><strong>What impact is industrial action likely to have on students?</strong></p>\n<p>UCU Industrial Action: It is hard to determine exactly what impact the industrial action will have. While UCU members make up a proportion of total academic and professional support staff, the membership is unevenly distributed across the University. We do not know how many trade union members will support the call to go on strike. It is likely that the strike action will mean that some classes are cancelled, and coursework may be affected. However, we are asking students to attend classes and engage with course material (whether on campus or online) unless advised otherwise. Beyond the strike dates, classes and exams will continue as normal</p>\n<p><strong>What is action short of a strike?</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>UCU only has also called for action short of a strike (ASOS) from Wednesday 23rd November 2022 until further notice. ASOS will consist of UCU members only working their contracted hours and not volunteering to do more, not rescheduling classes and lectures cancelled due to strike action, not covering for absent colleagues, removing uploaded materials related to, and/or not sharing materials related to, lectures or classes that will be or have been cancelled as a result of strike action.</p>\n<p><strong>Why can’t I get more definite information on how the action short of a strike will affect me?</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Quite simply, because we don’t know the full impact of the decision by some staff to take this action. We will work to minimise the disruption, and have put in place contingency plans, which we hope will, in most cases, fully resolve or minimise any issues. We do not expect that the extended period of working to contract will impact negatively on students.</p>\n<p><strong>Will I still be able to come onto campus during any strike action?</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Yes, the campus – including all learning, social and sports facilities – will remain open throughout the majority of the strike action (see exceptiosn re classes etc on this page). There may be a picket line at the entrance, but students and staff will be able to enter and leave the campus freely.</p>\n<p><strong>How will I know if my classes are to be cancelled?</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Legally, union members do not have to tell the University in advance if they are taking strike action. Consequently, we may not know which trade union members will exercise their right to strike on the days noted above.</p>\n<p>We hope that your lecturers will let you know in advance when classes may be withdrawn or rescheduled. You are entitled to ask them about this, although they are not obliged to provide an answer. We advise you to check your email and Canvas regularly during the affected period.</p>\n<p>We know that, along with all staff, union members genuinely care about the academic welfare of students, and some members may already have told you about their plans. In all cases, you can expect to be able to enter and leave the campus freely.</p>\n<p><strong>What about submission of assessments during the strike dates?</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Unless you are contacted by your School or Division to inform you otherwise, all assessment deadlines of which you have been notified previously will still apply.<br /><br /><strong>When will more information be available?</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>We will provide further updates by email whenever information becomes available.</p>"

No scheme contributions (employee or employer) will be deducted for any period of time spent on strike and, as a consequence, any earnings lost through industrial action are not included in benefit calculations.<br /><br /><strong><span class=\"lead\">What happens if I am on leave during any strike days?</span><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Any leave taken on the strike days must normally have been agreed in advance of the period of strike action. The University has a duty to minimise disruption to students, other staff and its stakeholders by ensuring that there is adequate staffing in place wherever possible. Line managers will be asked to take this responsibility into account with respect to any requests for leave during the strike action period. If you have previously agreed leave with your line manager on any of the strike days, then this will be respected and treated as leave.<br /><br /><strong><span class=\"lead\">Can I work from home on a strike day?</span><br /></strong></p>\n<p>The University operates a hybrid working model. This means that a number of staff may be working from home on the strike days under their locally agreed hybrid working arrangements.<br /><br /><strong><span class=\"lead\">What happens if I am sick on a strike day?</span><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Staff who are unable to attend work due to illness should follow the University’s Sickness Absence Management Policy and Procedure.<br /><br /><strong><span class=\"lead\">What if I do not want to go on strike?</span><br /></strong></p>\n<p>You are not compelled to take action, even if you voted in favour of such action. You cannot be ejected or disciplined by your union for declining to take part in the action.<br /><br /><strong><span class=\"lead\">I am a member of another trade union, can I take part in the UCU strike action?</span><br /></strong></p>\n<p>No. Members of trade unions who have not completed a ballot will not be able to take part in the industrial action.</p>"

      "title": "How To Record Strike Participation",
      "content": "<p><strong>How do I record that I have participated in Strike Action?</strong></p>\n<p>An email will be issued following strike days asking staff who have participated in strike action to confirm their participation via Employee Self Service, instructions will be provided in the email.</p>\n<p><strong>Why has the University changed the method of recording strike participation?</strong></p>\n<p>Given the increase in the number of strike days in 2022-23 it has been necessary for the University to consider how best to request, record and process information on strike participation from staff. The previous method was a very manual process which took up a considerable amount of time for HR and payroll staff. Attempting this for recent and any future days of action is no longer sustainable. Asking staff to record strike participation via Employee Self Service (ESS) reduces the email traffic involved in the process and allows HR staff to focus on reporting strike participation, in the required format, to payroll.</p>\n<p><strong>What will the information I record via Employee Self-Service be used for?</strong></p>\n<p>The information entered via Employee Self Service will be used for the purpose of payroll processing, to ensure that the appropriate payroll deductions in respect of strike participation are made and to make necessary arrangements to mitigate any negative impact on the student experience.</p>\n<p>Asking staff to record strike participation in this way is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). QMU has lawful grounds for recording and processing the data concerned. It has an Article 6 (1) UK GDPR ground for lawful processing namely it is necessary in connection with the performance of the employment contract. The University's <a href=\"/document-migration-august-2022/paul/new-pdf-conveted/hr-privacy/qmu-working-privacy-notice/worker-privacy-notice-update-2023-appendix-to-worker-privacy-notice-of-queen-margaret-university/\" title=\"Worker Privacy Notice and Appendix\">worker privacy notice and appendix</a> makes it clear that employee data may be processed to allow the University (which includes its managers) to administer its contract with its employees, to ensure their employees' compliance with their employment contract as well as for processing payments and benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Who will have access to the information recorded via Employee Self-Service?</strong></p>\n<p>HR and Payroll colleagues will have access to recorded data for the purposes of accurate payroll processing.  Line managers will not receive email notifications advising that direct reports have participated in strike action.  It is highlighted that line managers do have access to the iTrent system for the purposes of managing employees.  It is necessary for line managers to have sight of whether a member of staff has been absent due to industrial action so that they can coordinate a response to mitigate any negative impact on the student experience.  That would include reorganising lectures, classes or any other student learning or related activity.</p>\n<p>Collated lists of staff who participate in strike action are not routinely shared with line managers.</p>\n<p><strong>How long will this information remain on my record?</strong></p>\n<p>To comply with the required payroll legislation, information will remain on an employee’s record for 7 years.  This was the case prior to the change in the method used to record strike participation, however the information provided was entered into iTrent manually.</p>"
