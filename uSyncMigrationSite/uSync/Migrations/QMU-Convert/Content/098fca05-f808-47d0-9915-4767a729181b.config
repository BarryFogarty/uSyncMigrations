<p><span class="lead">Honorary Title</span></p>
<p>The Dean of School will consider applications for Honorary titles and renewal of existing Honorary titles where appropriate.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Procedure for Appointment of New Honorary Titles</span></p>
<p>An Honorary title may be identified by the Dean of School, Head of Division or Academic staff member. The following Honorary titles are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honorary Professor</li>
<li>Honorary Lecturer</li>
<li>Honorary Fellow</li>
<li>Honorary Senior Research Fellow</li>
<li>Honorary Research Fellow</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information on each Honorary title can be found in Appendix 3.</p>
<p>The title of Emeritus Professor is an honorary title, but it is distinct from that of Honorary Fellow, and from the conferment of an Honorary degree, and as such a separate procedure exists within the University.</p>
<p>Where an individual has been identified for an Honorary title, the Honorary Title Application Form (Appendix 1) should be completed summarising the main grounds on which the application is being made. The candidate’s CV must be attached to the form.</p>
<p>Where the application is initiated by an Academic Staff member, they should pass the form to the Head of Division to complete the appropriate section of the form. The Head of Division may wish to consult the Academic staff member or the Dean of School to seek additional information before completing the form. Where the Head of Division does not support the application, they should discuss this with the Academic staff member.</p>
<p>The Head of Division should forward the form and CV to the Dean of School for consideration against the criteria set out in Appendix 3. The Dean of School may wish to consult the Academic staff member or the Head of Division to seek additional information before deciding on the outcome. If supported, the Dean of School should sign the application form and forward it to their HR Partner. HR will write to the individual to confirm the Honorary title and associated terms and conditions. Where the application is not supported, the Dean of School should discuss this with the Academic staff member and Head of Division.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Procedure for Renewing Existing Honorary Titles</span></p>
<p>HR will inform the Dean of School where an existing Honorary title is due for review. The Dean of School should alert the Head of Division to liaise with the original nominator to determine if an extension should be offered. If an extension is required then the academic staff nominator and Head of Division should complete the Honorary Title Application Form, summarising the main reasons for extension. This form should be submitted to the Dean of School.</p>
<p>If the Dean of School concludes that an extension should be offered then they should sign the application form and forward it to their HR Partner to write to the Honorary individual to confirm the period of extension.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Termination of Existing Honorary Titles</span></p>
<p>Where an existing Honorary title is due for renewal and it is determined that an extension should not be offered, the Dean of School should confirm this to their HR Partner who will write to the individual to confirm the end date of their Honorary title.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Withdrawal of Honorary Status</span></p>
<p>Awards of honorary title are expected to last for the full period the status has been granted.</p>
<p>However, there are circumstances under which the title may be withdrawn, as set out below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the requirement for the individual to retain honorary title for the period agreed no longer exists, eg where the contribution they are required to make ceases earlier than expected</li>
<li>Where the individual has accepted a contract of employment with the University (although the honorary title may be awarded again if the individual’s employment with the University comes to an end)</li>
<li>Where the actions of the individual, either within or outside of the University, could result, or have resulted in, negative publicity for the University.</li>
<li>Where the individual has been found to have breached University policies or procedures, and where such breach would have ordinarily led to formal disciplinary action if the holder of honorary status had been an employee of the University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any proposal to withdraw honorary status must be agreed by the relevant Dean of School before it is communicated to the individual concerned.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Remuneration</span></p>
<p>Holders of any honorary title cannot also be paid employees of the University. If the holders of such a status are receiving payment for services to the University, regardless of whether the work is in a different School from where the honorary title was given, the honorary title will lapse. In such circumstances, the honorary titles may be re-awarded once the recipients have completed their paid work for the University.</p>
