<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Clinical Placements</strong></p>
<p>To ensure the quality and effectiveness of practice placements all new and current placements are required to be approved. The module coordinator or a member of the Diagnostic Radiography team will complete a clinical monitoring report, in conjunction with a named representative from each clinical placement (Appendix A). Placements will be monitored on an annual basis, unless there is a major change within the placement provision, or there is cause for concern.</p>
<p>The following individuals have key roles and defined responsibilities with regard to implementing, coordinating and monitoring clinical education programmes.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Module Coordinator</strong></p>
<p>The module coordinator has responsibility for placing students appropriately to ensure achievement of learning outcomes, organising workshops for students, supervisors and assessors as well as coordinating, implementing and supervising the assessment systems. A key aspect of the role of this individual is effective collaboration with managers and clinicians to ensure that common aims and outcomes are established and achieved. Close liaison with clinical tutors / liaison officers is essential to plan and monitor clinical education appropriately. The individual must interact effectively with the students to encourage development of skills in self-appraisal and reflective practice.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><strong>Lecturers / Clinical Tutors / Student Liaison Officers</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In addition to providing pastoral care and support, lecturers / clinical tutors / student liaison officers have responsibility for management and education of students on clinical placement and must adopt a key role in collaborating with practitioners to ensure equity of student experience and learning opportunity. They will contribute to the continuous evaluation and development of clinical education and will establish effective relationships with members of the multi-professional team.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Supervisors</strong></p>
<p>Radiographers are responsible for the teaching and effective supervision of the student on a daily basis as well as monitoring their performance and progress. They have a key role within the continuous assessment scheme, being responsible for the daily appraisal of performance and the provision of continuous feedback to students. All clinical supervisors should undergo training with periodic updates.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Assessors</strong></p>
<p>Radiographers, having undergone appropriate training, who are responsible for planning, implementing and conducting staged assessments in partnership with the module coordinator, lecturers and clinical tutors.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Notification of Concern</strong></p>
<p>Any supervisor or assessor who has concerns about student performance levels in any of the domains of clinical practice has a clear responsibility to notify the module coordinator. A reporting proforma is available for staff completion (Appendix B). After completion, the individual will notify the module coordinator who will arrange a meeting to discuss their concerns and explore possible actions</p>

      "content": "<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University has an obligation to ensure that graduates from its pre-registration healthcare programmes are fit to practise. This means we need to consider whether students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>have a long-term health condition or disability which could prevent them from practising safely without supervision;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have any criminal convictions or cautions which could make them unsuitable for registration;</p>\n</li>\n<li>have demonstrated that they can maintain the standards of conduct expected of a health professional.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The students’ behaviour on placement and in private life has the potential to affect their suitability for registration. If the University becomes aware of an issue regarding a student’s behaviour it may initiate Fitness to Practise proceedings. Where there are serious concerns, a Fitness to Practise panel may be convened. The Fitness to Practise panel has the authority to impose a range of sanctions, including requiring a student to suspend study or even to leave the programme.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the QMU Fitness to Practise Policy (Table 1).</p>\n<p>The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) publishes guidance for students and registrants about Fitness to Practise (Table 1).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Health and Disability</strong></p>\n<p>Students should keep their Personal Academic Tutor or Programme Leader informed of any changes to their health or disability status.

The Continuous Clinical Assessment Programme is designed to describe and monitor these levels of skill and achievement across the students’ range of activity.</p>\n<p><strong>PBL1</strong>, the student starts in clinical practice as a ‘novice’ with minimal clinical experience but some academic knowledge who will observe clinical activity and attempt to link these observations to existing knowledge. As PBL 1 progresses, the learner will gain enough clinical expertise to allow supervised and directed practice. To achieve a pass in PBL 1 the student must demonstrate a minimum rating of ‘C’ overall. Those who do not achieve the minimum required standard will have results presented to the Board of Examiners and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval.</p>\n<p><strong>PBL2</strong>, the student continues to build on their initial practical experience linking activities and elements together to be able to consistently perform routine general radiographic examinations. Students will extend their skills to enable modification and adaptation of routine examinations. As PBL 2 progresses the students will demonstrate increased levels of expertise thus requiring minimal support. To achieve a pass in PBL 2 the student must demonstrate a minimum rating of ‘C’ overall. Those who do not achieve the minimum requiredstandard will have results presented to the Board of Examiners and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>PBL3</strong>, the student will develop a knowledge and skills base in specialist areas to enable participation in specialist procedures. To achieve a pass in PBL 3, a minimum rating of ‘D’ for specialist placements in MRI, CT or Ultrasound, for example, is required. Those who do not achieve the minimum required standard will have results presented to the Board of Examiners and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval.</p>\n<p><strong>PBL4</strong>, students learn to adapt their skills to enable the performance of procedures in routine, non-routine and complex situations. They will be able to plan, organise and prioritise multiple clinical events appropriately. The student will arrange an elective placement to broaden their clinical expertise and versatility.<br />These skills should be considered as elements of clinical competence. As the individual gains experience and knowledge, the basic skills are combined and integrated into overall professional competence which will enable the graduate to apply their skills in a flexible manner whilst responding imaginatively to new and unfamiliar situations. To achieve a pass in PBL4, the student must demonstrate a minimum rating of ‘C’ overall. Those who do not achieve the minimum required standard will have results presented to the Board of Examiners and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval. Elective placements do not form part of the continuous assessment process, but 100% attendance is required.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Domains of Practice</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In order to evaluate and monitor competence in Diagnostic Radiography it is necessary to identify the elements of competent practice. The application of domains of practice allows recognition of professional skills, which are essential components of clinical, technical and interpersonal competence. Using levels of achievement allows for progressive evaluation of developing skills.

<p>Clinical education placements have a theoretical as well as a practical focus. They provide clear opportunities for students to develop, evaluate, organise and build upon academic learning in a progressive fashion. They enable integration of theory with practice and the safe, effective assimilation of the student into the multidisciplinary health care team.</p>
<p>Clinical and academic blocks are integrated programme elements and should not be viewed as standing alone. Lecturers, Clinical Tutors, Student Liaison Officers, Assessors, Supervisors and all members of the multidisciplinary department teams facilitate continuous linking of theory with practice and provide sound student support. Clinical education for students of diagnostic radiography is delivered from imaging departments in Ayr Hospital,Ayr; Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock; Borders General Hospital, Melrose; Forth Valley Royal, Larbert; Leith Community Treatment Centre; Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline; Roodlands Hospital, Haddington; Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh; Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh; St John’s Hospital, Livingston; Stirling Royal Infirmary; Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy; Western General Hospital, Edinburgh; Perth Royal Infirmary, Perth and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. Information regarding staffing and available modalities may be found in the Clinical Placement Handbook.</p>
<p>These organisations provide guided experiential learning through supervised direct patient contact and allow opportunities to develop personal confidence and professional competence. They facilitate the acquisition of clinical judgment skills and the expertise required to become a competent practitioner and effective member of the multidisciplinary health care team.</p>
<p>The clinical education programme includes elements of clinical supervision, clinical workshops, tutorials and clinical assessment and, with emphases on communication and reflection, enables students to acquire the clinical competencies required for registration by the Health Professions Council. Students will also acquire the investigative and analytical skills necessary to enhance the knowledge base of the profession.</p>
