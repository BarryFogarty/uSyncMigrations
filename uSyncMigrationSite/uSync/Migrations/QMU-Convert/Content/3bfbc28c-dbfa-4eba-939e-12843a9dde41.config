      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh?</span></p>
<p>Edinburgh has always been my home and is a fantastic place to study and live and the University really appealed to me.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">The Course</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been your highlight?</span></p>
<p>I have enjoyed the different subjects and how each part of the course is interlinked to business. In IHTM, we have a 6-month placement and I went to Guernsey in the Channel Islands where I took on the role of duty manager. I was responsible for 45 members of staff who I managed during this placement. This was a fantastic opportunity where I learned a lot about myself and future career prospects.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Has there been a particular course activity you found especially interesting?</span></p>
<p><br />I particularly enjoyed finance and strategy as I found these fascinating, these subjects have contributed to my choices in future study.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></p>
<p>Before starting the course, gain as much experience in the industry as possible as this will help with your studies and your understanding of how the industry operates.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Have you won any awards/scholarship/internships, etc., that have helped you develop skills and experience? If so, please tell us about them.</span></p>
<p>During my time at University I have won the Moffat scholarship, Lord Forte Scholarship and a HIT Scotland Scholarship. The Lord Forte scholarship was in partnership with the Balmoral Hotel. I was invited to a conference in Switzerland where I learned from industry experts about the future of hospitality, this was sponsored by HIT Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What university services have you used to support you through your university journey and how have they helped you?</span></p>
<p>I have used the LRC and ELS. These are a fantastic resource to the University who I have used since first year in order to build on my academic experience.</p>
<p><span class="lead lead-big">Life as a Student at QMU</span></p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Are you a member of a QMU club or society? If so, what was the reason behind your choice and what do you enjoy most about it?</span></p>
<p><br />I am an Officer of the Edinburgh University Royal Navy Unit which is a fantastic opportunity to be trained by the MOD and for some fantastic sea time.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What’s your ‘top tip’ for making the most of being a student?</span></p>
<p>Take every experience you are offered and try to make the most of it. University will be the best years of your life and an opportunity to learn and develop as an academic but also as an individual.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What has been the most valuable lesson that you’ve learned at university?</span></p>
<p><br />I’ve learned to be confident in my abilities and to never give up in any aspect of life and if you want something to go and get it. Push yourself to the limit and push further until you succeed.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What are you plans after graduation? Tell us about your ambitions and where you see yourself in the future?</span></p>
<p>My plan after graduation is to complete my MSC in Finance and Accounting. In the future, I hope to move into business consultancy and specialise in finance, business and hospitality.</p>
