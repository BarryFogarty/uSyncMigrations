      <Value><![CDATA[<p>In our opinion, the financial statements: </p>
<ul>
<li>give a true and fair view of the group’s and of the parent institution’s state of affairs as at 31 July 2021 and of the group and parent institution’s income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and changes in reserves and of the group’s statement of cash flows for the year then ended;</li>
<li>have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;</li>
<li>have been properly prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further and Higher Education, and relevant legislation; and</li>
<li>have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and regulation 14 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basis for opinion </strong></p>
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent institution in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.</p>
<p>We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Conclusions relating to going concern</strong></p>
<p>In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the University Court’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent institution’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 20 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.</p>
<p>Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.  However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p><strong>Other information </strong></p>
<p>The other information comprises the information included in the Strategic Report and Financial Statements, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.  The University Court is responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.</p>
<p>We have nothing to report in this regard.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006</strong></p>
<p>In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:</p>
<ul>
<li>the information given in the Strategic Report and Financial Statements, which includes the directors’ report and the strategic report prepared for the purpose of company law, for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared, is consistent with the financial statements; and</li>
<li>the strategic report and the directors’ report included within the Strategic Report and Financial Statements, have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opinion</strong><strong> on other matters prescribed by the Scottish Funding Council's Financial Memorandum with Higher Education Institutions</strong></p>
<p>In our opinion, in all material respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>the requirements of the Scottish Funding Council’s accounts direction have been met;</li>
<li>funds from whatever source administered by the institution for specific purposes have been applied properly to those purposes and, if relevant, managed in accordance with relevant legislation, and any other terms and conditions attached to them; and</li>
<li>funds provided by Scottish Funding Council have been applied in accordance with the requirements of the Scottish Funding Council Financial Memorandum with Higher Education Institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Matters on which we are required to report by exception</strong></p>
<p>In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Institution and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have identified no material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report included within the Strategic Report and Financial Statements.</p>
<p>We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Accounts (Scotland) regulations 2006 (as amended) requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>adequate and proper accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or</li>
<li>the parent institution financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or</li>
<li>certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or</li>
<li>we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Responsibilities of the University Court</strong></p>
<p>As explained more fully in the Responsibilities of the University Court set out on page 15, the University Court (who are also the directors of the parent institution for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the University Court determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</p>
<p>In preparing the financial statements, the University Court is responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent institution’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the University Court either intends to liquidate the group or the parent institution or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements </strong></p>
<p>We have been appointed as auditor under section 44(1)(c) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and under the Companies Act 2006 and report in accordance with the Acts and relevant regulations made or having effect thereunder.</p>
<p>Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. </p>
<p><strong>Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud </strong></p>
<p>Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the University and management.</p>
<p>Our approach was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and parent institution and determined that the most significant are FRS 102 and Statement of Recommended Practice for Further and Higher Education.</li>
<li>We understood how the group and parent institution is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquires through our review of the Court minutes and papers provided to the Audit and Risk Committee at a Group level, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures to either corroborate or provide contrary evidence which was then followed up;</li>
<li>We assessed the susceptibility of the group and parent institution’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management to understand where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their influence on efforts made by management to manage income and expenditure. Where this risk was considered higher, we performed audit procedures to address the risk of fraud and management override. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error;</li>
<li>Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved enquiries of management, those charged with governance and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures; journal entry testing with a focus on journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business and a review of Court minutes to identify any non-compliance with laws and regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  This description forms part of our auditor’s report.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Use of our report</strong></p>
