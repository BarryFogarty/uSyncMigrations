These will be students that are care experienced, carers, estranged, single parents, young students in receipt of the young student bursary, and mature students in receipt of the mature student bursary. Applications are not limited to these students however and will be looked at on a case by case basis.</p>\n<p>Please email <a href=\"mailto:technologysupportfund@qmu.ac.uk\">technologysupportfund@qmu.ac.uk</a> if you wish to apply for the long term loan of a laptop, giving a brief explanation of your circumstances. You will then be sent the link to the short online application form along with information about the evidence you will need to submit to support your application. This will normally be evidence of funding from your funding authority eg SAAS and a recent bank statement.</p>\n<p>Students that cannot apply for a laptop through this initiative are those that have chosen not to take the student loan available to them, research students and students already in receipt of a laptop through Disabled students allowance.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we are unable to make short term laptop loans due to, for example, a student having their laptop repaired.</p>"

If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.</p>\n<p>There is no such thing as ‘money for nothing’, if you move money from an unknown source into your account you are potentially committing a crime with serious consequences. Money Laundering by becoming a Money Mule supports organised crime. These criminal groups may be involved in serious criminal activity such as human trafficking, child sexual abuse and exploitation or blackmail and extortion. It is not a victimless crime. </p>\n<p>Tips to avoid becoming a Money Mule</p>\n<p>1 – Don’t give your bank account details to anyone unless you know and trust them.</p>\n<p>2 – Be wary of job offers where all interactions and transactions will be done online.</p>\n<p>3 – Be cautious of unsolicited offers of easy money.</p>\n<p>4 – Research any company that makes you a job offer and confirm that their contact details are genuine.</p>\n<p>5 – Be wary of job offers from overseas.
