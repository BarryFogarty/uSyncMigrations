Outside these formally timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a range of methods such as written exams, reports, poster presentations, business plans, live pitch, group presentations and negotiation role play.</p>\n<p>You will have the iterative support of Academic Development (AD) throughout your course to enable you to confidently manage the purely academic challenges of your study, and address the diverse technical requirements of your assignments. AD will be available not only as a regular taught component of your study timetable, but in the form of self-study materials available via your module hubs/websites etc. and as ad hoc one-to-one or small group sessions, which can usually be arranged at short notice.</p>\n<p><strong>Experience Semester (placement, exchange opportunity or business plan development)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Placement:</strong> In the second semester of Year Three you will undertake an ‘experience’ semester. You will have the opportunity to undertake an organisational placement, study abroad or you can develop your own business plan with a support from our expert academics. Placements are an excellent opportunity to put your learning into practice. Some of our graduates have secured a graduate role within the organisation they undertook their placement. Students are responsible for sourcing a placement host organisation, which can be in the UK or abroad. We support you to find a placement host.</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong>: Studying abroad through our exchange programme can be one of the most exciting and rewarding challenges for a student to experience. The opportunity to travel and live in another country, learn different customs and traditions, meet new people and future career draws many students into the exchange programme. The tuition fees are covered in the reciprocal arrangements and there are other funding support available to cover other costs. Many of our students get additional funding support through grants and other funding schemes. We help you to apply for funding support in pursuing these opportunities. </p>\n<p><strong>Develop a business plan</strong>: If you are keen to set up your own business in the future, then this is an excellent option.  Expert advice and guidance is available to help you with planning your business – all designed to give you the skills to succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
