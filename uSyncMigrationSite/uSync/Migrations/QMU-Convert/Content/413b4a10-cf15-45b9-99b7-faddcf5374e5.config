      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Studying at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, gave me the opportunity to study in a beautiful country and meet some amazing people. Everyone was very kind and welcoming and all the tutors were willing to help in whatever way they could, to make the transition from QMU to Brock as smooth as possible. This included support with assignments and class work as although studying the same course, the way in which assessments are undertaken at Brock were quite different to that of QMU.</p>
<p>During my time there, I also had the opportunity to see Montreal during our reading week, which was incredible. I would thoroughly encourage anyone going on exchange to see as many places as they can and get stuck in with as many clubs or opportunities that may arise. Obviously there will still be a lot of university work and studying to do, but make sure you enjoy yourself whilst you are there as well!</p>]]></Value>
