      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>APPOINTMENT OF CHAIR OF COURT</strong></p>
<p>Queen Margaret University Court is seeking to appoint a Chair to succeed Dr Frances Dow CBE who retired early in 2020. The position is currently occupied by Linda McPherson, Vice-Chair, in an Acting capacity.</p>
<p>The Court plays a crucial role in the development of the University’s vision and strategic direction. This appointment provides a significant opportunity for an experienced individual to lead the Court, and to work with the new Principal, Sir Paul Grice, on positioning the University’s future strategic direction.</p>
<p>The Chair of the Court is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the Court, and for ensuring that the University is well connected with its stakeholders, including its staff and students. The Chair leads the Court in observing the highest standards of corporate governance, including those set out in the Scottish Code of Good Higher Education Governance. </p>
<p>To fulfil this important role, we are seeking an individual with a distinguished record of successful leadership at a senior and strategic level within a large and complex public, private or third sector organisation. Ideal candidates will be able to demonstrate excellent leadership and interpersonal skills, coupled with a strong commitment to, and affinity for, higher education.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest are invited from individuals with experience of chairing boards and committees responsible for managing strategic issues, with knowledge of the Scottish higher education sector, or with experience of key bodies relating to education in general.</p>
<p>If you share our values and vision, are able to subscribe to the commitments set out in the role specification, and consider you meet the person specification, we would like to hear from you.</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is committed to ensuring that its Court represents the staff, students and community which it serves. As such, we would welcome applications that reflect the breadth and diversity of those communities, and that would further enhance the diversity of the Court. We welcome applications from all qualified candidates regardless of personal background.</p>
<p><strong>Applications should be submitted by 12 noon on Friday, 25 September 2020.</strong></p>
