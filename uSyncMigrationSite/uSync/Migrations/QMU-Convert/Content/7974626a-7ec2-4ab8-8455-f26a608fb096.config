This means that not only do they consume far less electricity than traditional computers; they also generate much less heat, reducing the need for artificial ventilation.

Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a way to apply for partial or full exemption from having to undertake a module, level of study, or assessment. RPL describes the use of prior learning, either as a formative tool as part of personal development, or as a summative tool for the award of credit. The learning may have taken place either as part of a formal educational course or as part of an informal life or work experience outside formal educational settings. This acknowledges that there may be a stage of discussion, reflection and formative assignments, prior to any formal application for the accreditation of prior learning. You should discuss this with your module and/or Programme Leader at your earliest convenience.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>You can view the policy, process and documentation by following this link[broken link]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Equal Opportunities at QMU</strong></p>\n<p>Queen Margaret University welcomes diversity amongst its students, staff, applicants and visitors, recognising the particular contributions to the achievement of the institution's mission that can be made by individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.

A non- native speaker can easily feel uncomfortable among native speaking online communicators, especially in the chat room setting. The University asks you to recognise that different cultures bring different points of reference, different understandings of humour and different expectations of online communication, so:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid using complicated language, terminology, slang, idioms or local acronyms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be aware of differences in date formats and measurements</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be careful with sarcasm and humour, and avoid ridicule</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow extra time for responses, especially in chats</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember that language, fluency and intelligence are very different things</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Admit mistakes and apologise</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Freedom of Information, Data Protection and Complaints Handling Procedure</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Freedom of Information</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Compliance with the Freedom of Information (Scotland) 2002 Act (FoISA) at Queen Margaret University is coordinated by the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement.</p>\n<p>FoISA intends to encourage public organisations to become more open and accountable.

If a student has a complaint, they should discuss this with someone in the area which the student wishes to complain about (for example, for a complaint relating to speech and hearing sciences, this should be discussed with the Programme Leader or Module Coordinator for the module concerned). The complaint will be considered under frontline resolution (unless complex) and a response will usually be given within 5 working days. If the complaint is complicated, it is the student’s choice to take it to investigation stage immediately or it may be referred to the investigation stage by the person the student determined to discuss the complaint with at frontline resolution. Should the complaint be considered under the investigation stage, a response will normally be received within 20 working days.</p>\n<p>Any queries about the complaints procedure or any complaints written on the Complaints Form may be emailed to <a href=\"mailto:complaints@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Complaints Email Address\">QMU Complaints Email Address</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
