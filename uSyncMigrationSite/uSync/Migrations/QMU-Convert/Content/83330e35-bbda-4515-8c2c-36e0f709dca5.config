Susan qualified from Queen Margaret College in 1993 and began working in the NHS, returning to the university as a researcher and lecturer.</p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">Susan has worked across a wide range of mental health services in Scotland and England from high and medium security forensic services to community rehabilitation. During her clinical career Susan’s priorities were always working with service users to find opportunities and support people to participate in meaningful life roles, engaging with evidence-based practice and standardised measures ensured service users strengths and needs were recognised and outcomes could be measures. Susan’s interest in evidence-based practice and the Model of Human Occupation led to opportunities to lead practice development activities in the NHS and informed research and lecturing.</p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">Susan is programme leader for the post-registration MSc Advancing Practice Occupational Therapy Programme, she works on the admissions team as well as leading and contributing to modules and supervision on both undergraduate and post-graduate programmes.</p>\n<p><strong>Affiliations/Memberships to Other Organisations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>British Association of Occupational Therapists 1993-present</li>\n<li>Health and Care Professions Council 1993-present</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Professional Social Media:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter: @SusanOTuk; @ResearchFirefly; @MOHOInt</li>\n<li>Research Gate: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susan-Prior-2\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susan-Prior-2</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research/Knowledge Exchange Centre Membership:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affiliate member of the <a data-id=\"1265\" href=\"/{localLink:1265}\" title=\"Centre for Applied Social Sciences\">Centre for Applied Social Sciences</a></li>\n</ul>"

      "content": "<p class=\"xmsonormal\">In 2008 Susan was appointed as a Lead Research Practitioner at Queen Margaret University to lead a participatory action research initiative redesigning vocational rehabilitation services for people with complex and enduring mental health problems. Recognizing that engagement in employment is often a goal of service users in their own recovery journey providing a great opportunity for clients to participate in society and achieve aspirations in their own recovery journey. In this post she worked closely with clinicians and service users in the NHS.</p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">Susan continues to develop this research interest in vocational rehabilitation through efficacy studies and with new populations. Current research is focused on understanding psychosocial variables which are predictive of service users expressing desire to obtain employment and of eventual employment related outcome. Susan works closely with clinical service in the UK and collaborates with a network of international researchers with similar interests in the Model of Human Occupation and Vocational Rehabilitation. Susan completed her own doctoral studies in 2019 and supervises others in their own doctoral studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Research Interests:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vocational rehabilitation</li>\n<li>Occupational Therapy</li>\n<li>Model of Human Occupation</li>\n<li>Evidence Based Supported Employment</li>\n<li>Mental Health</li>\n<li>Veterans</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research Methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participatory Action Research</li>\n<li>Systematic reviews</li>\n<li>Meta synthesis</li>\n<li>Meta analysis</li>\n<li>Prospective cohort studies</li>\n<li>Multiple logistic regression modelling</li>\n</ul>"
