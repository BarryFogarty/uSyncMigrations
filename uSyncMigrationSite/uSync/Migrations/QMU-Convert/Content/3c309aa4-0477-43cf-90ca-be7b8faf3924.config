<ul>
<li><strong>Designed in collaboration with a professional body which qualifies you both academically and professionally:</strong> This collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cimaglobal.com/">Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)</a> offers the opportunity for students to obtain a master’s degree, a prestigious professional qualification (CIMA Advanced Diploma in Management Accounting) and the maximum 11 exemptions from CIMA’s certificate, operational and management level examinations.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching expertise and care:</strong> The course is taught by professionally qualified chartered accountants and academics with industry and research expertise. With the small class size, you will be able to learn from a caring team of finance professionals who have your career development as a priority. Our recent (2023), QSS results rated postgraduate teaching quality on MSc in Accounting and Finance (with CIMA) at over 97%.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse career opportunities:</strong> By collaborating with CIMA, we are opening up our students to a host of roles in a professional capacity and you are not obligated to becoming an chartered accountant. This management accounting qualification is broad enough to lead to key roles in the areas of information management, consultancy, operations, commercial, executive and, of course, finance.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible study options:</strong> We offer full-time, part-time and single module study options.</li>
<li><strong>An accessible route to a new career:</strong> This course has been designed in a way that allows students without a finance degree to apply but relevant accounting and finance working experience is preferred.</li>
<li><strong>Great location:</strong> QMU is located in the UK’s second largest financial centre. Not only does this pave the way for career opportunities on graduation, but also enables us to offer field trips and enlist guest speakers to enhance your learning experience.</li>
<li><strong>Access to our on-campus <a href="/services-for-business-and-industry/business-innovation-zone/">Business Gateway and Business Innovation Zone (BIZ)</a>:</strong> This provides business incubation space for student/graduate-led start-up companies with access to: desk space, a QMU business address, meeting facilities, Business Gateway support and advice, a profile for your company on the QMU website, support with marketing materials, and access to entrepreneurial networks within QMU and other universities, for example, Enterprise Campus, Scottish Institute for Enterprise, Sporting Chance and Converge Challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Professional links:</strong> The Queen Margaret Business School is a member of the <a href="https://charteredabs.org/">Chartered Association of Business Schools (CABS)</a>. and a signatory member of <a href="https://www.unprme.org/queen-margaret-business-school/">The Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME).</a> Our courses are designed with close collaboration with professional bodies including <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/home">Chartered Institute of Management Accountants</a> and <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/">Digital Marketing Institute</a>. This means our qualifications are recognised by these bodies and upon successful completion of our courses, you can fast track your professional qualification should you wish you achieve one.  </li>

The module aims to develop excellent project and client management skills alongside high-level writing skills that include excellent reflective abilities.</li>\n<li><strong>The Business Incubation Programme (60 credits):</strong>The aim of this module is to critically evaluate a range of nascent, micro and family businesses and to develop, through inception, investigation and planning, a new start-up business or social enterprise of your own design. You will work with mentors, QMU’s Business Innovation Zone (BIZ) and the on-campus Business Gateway to take your business from idea to reality</li>\n<li><strong>Accounting or Finance Dissertation (60 credits): </strong>To enable students to develop, plan and critically evaluate a piece of research in the relevant degree subject related area, written up in the form of a dissertation.
