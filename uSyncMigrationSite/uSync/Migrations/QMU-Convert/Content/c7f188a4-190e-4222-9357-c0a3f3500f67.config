He wished to acknowledge also the exceptional support provided by the Scottish Government to the sector in response to the pandemic, reporting that there had been extensive opportunities for engagement with Ministers. The return to campus in semester one was identified as a particular highlight of the past year. Other more recent highlights included the Fireside Chat between Dame Prue Leith, Chancellor and Carolyn Currie, QMU’s Entrepreneur in Residence, as mentioned earlier in the Chair’s report (minute 5 refers), and a recent online conversation about the historical figure Queen Margaret as part of the QMU celebrations around Saint Margaret’s Day.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Planning for semester two</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was being kept under close review in the run up to semester two. At this stage, it was not expected that there would be further restrictions affecting the student experience, beyond travel and quarantine requirements. As such, it was planned to continue with the blended learning model in semester two. However, should it become necessary to revert to online provision, contingency plans were in place. The Principal advised that plans were also in place to support students remaining on campus over the festive closure period.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Staff updates</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Principal provided a further update on staff wellbeing initiatives. A University-wide stress risk assessment had been conducted, and was available to all staff. The stress risk assessment would inform the staff Wellbeing Strategy, which was being developed for publication in 2022. In recognition of the exceptional pressures on staff during the pandemic, the Senior Leadership Team had agreed a number of additional wellbeing days for all staff, the next of which was scheduled just prior to the festive closure period (Thursday, 23 December). Members were advised that strike action was scheduled from 1-3 December 2021, following a University and College Union (UCU) ballot. The strike action would be followed by action short of strike. At this stage, it was too early to gauge the impact of the action on the student experience.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Scottish Funding Council (SFC) Review of Coherent Provision and Sustainability</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Chair had reported previously on this item (minute 5 refers). The Principal added some further reflections, noting in particular that the recommendations from the Review were closely aligned with QMU ambitions for widening participation and collaboration. More generally, he considered that appetite for collaboration was a particularly strong feature of Scottish tertiary education, and this would be conducive to positive engagement with the recommendations. The Review also had a strong focus on skills development for employability. Again, this aligned with current University activity, most <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">recently the development of micro-credentials. The Scottish Government had broadly welcomed the recommendations within the review, including those relating to digital investment, sustainability, enterprise and innovation and research.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Principal reiterated the position advised at previous meetings of the Court, namely that it would be important to retain the distinctiveness of individual FE and HE providers, noting also that the funding position remained challenging and this would influence the extent to which the sectors could influence positive change.</p>\n<p>The planned development of a single quality framework for tertiary education had been subject to particular discussion, and presented some cause for concern across both sectors. The Principal welcomed the response from the Scottish Government to this particular recommendation, in that the Scottish Government acknowledged the strengths of the current arrangements. Members were advised that the Scottish Quality Enhancement Framework for Higher Education was well-established, having first been introduced in 2002 with a particular focus on improving the student experience. Noting that there was an ongoing review of the SQA, members queried whether this would influence the timeline for the development of the single quality framework. It was not expected that this would be the case, however.</p>\n<p>Members would have the opportunity at the Court Strategy Day in February 2022 to reflect further on the Review and other external developments, including the Scottish Government’s ‘Programme for Government’, which had been reported on at the previous Court meeting, and the outcomes from the recent COP26 in Glasgow. The Principal committed to continue to provide written updates between meetings to keep members updated on internal and external developments.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

This showed SAAS hardship funds in the balance sheet, matched by an increase in deferred income. Ernst and Young had also issued an updated audit results report.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The year-end accounts showed an underlying surplus of just under £1m, this being an improvement of £160k from the quarter 4 forecast. An explanation of the movements was provided to Court members in Annex A. Ernst and Young had identified a further adjustment on 30 November 2021 relating to deferral of income, but this fell below the materiality threshold and was noted as an unadjusted difference.</p>\n<p>As set out in Annex C, the University had complied with all bank covenants and would have complied also with the pre-Covid original covenants in place before the relaxation granted by Barclays. ‘Below the line’ movements on pension provisions and revaluation loss on buildings were noted, neither of which represented a cash movement. The accounts confirmed overall positive reserves of £73.7 million with a surplus of £10.7million (compared to a deficit of £9.7million in 2020). Unrestricted cash balances had increased by £6.5 million during the year. The QMU Enterprises Ltd Board had met on Monday and approved the accounts for that company.</p>\n<p>Members were advised that, as in the previous year, the Court required to form an opinion on whether the University should prepare its accounts on a going concern basis. Members were provided with the definition of a going concern and the assumptions underlying the current forecast, which were set out in Annex B.</p>\n<p>As previously indicated, Barclays had agreed a relaxation of the operational leverage covenant at 31 July 2022, and Court was asked to approve the acceptance letter of variation ((COURT (21) 34). Three further scenarios had been considered in which adverse sensitivities were applied to the base forecast, and possible mitigating actions then modelled for each scenario. All scenarios, after taking reasonable mitigating actions, indicated that the University could continue in operation for the period through to 31 July 2023, whilst maintaining a minimum £5m cash balance and meeting the other Barclays bank covenants. In addition to the consideration of scenarios, the rolling five-year review of KPIs indicated that EBITDA and the cash indicators were above the long-term average target.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Based on this analysis, Court was invited to agree the Management Assessment of Going Concern, as set out in Appendix A.</p>\n<p>Members were reminded of the Court’s responsibility for the Review of the University’s internal controls. The internal audit annual report (COURT (21) 36) included an opinion that the University’s framework of controls ‘provides reasonable assurance regarding the organisation’s governance framework, internal controls, effective and efficientachievement of objectives and the management of key risks’, this being the highest level of assurance possible. The external audit annual report (COURT (21) 35) included an assessment of the control environment with just one low rated observation around review of fully deprecated assets. The annual report from the Audit and Risk Committee (COURT (21) 38) noted that the Committee’s assessment that ‘the University’s systems provide a reasonable basis for maintaining control and for ensuring the achievement of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, subject to the satisfactory implementation of the recommendations of the internal auditors within a reasonable timescale’. It was noted further that the accounting policies were the same as those in place last year and continued to be considered appropriate.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>As a standard part of their audit procedures, Ernst and Young sought management representations from the Court. An updated letter circulated on 23 November 2021, <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">and a signed ’back to back’ letter from the Principal and Director of Finance and Corporate Strategic Development had been lodged with the Chair and the Secretary.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Chair thanked the Director of Finance and Corporate Strategic Development for the comprehensive overview and detailed set of papers.

Introducing the paper, the Head of Planning advised that the commentary focused primarily on information that had not been available at the time of the 2020-21 quarter four report, or had been updated since then. The main updates from the report were as listed below:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>The percentage of applications from SIMD20 postcodes during 2020-21 for entry in 2021-22 was 15.5%.

The key indicator available was student numbers. Undergraduate student numbers were slightly below target for home fee students, but the potential shortfall in fee income was likely to be offset by strong RUK (including new students from the Republic of Ireland) and international numbers. Postgraduate numbers would be finalised following the January intake. Whilst the January intake appeared healthy, based on the September intake and current projections, there was a risk of falling short of the target on postgraduate numbers (by around 5%). The situation, along with the fee impact, would be clearer at quarter two. Initial calculations indicated that, overall, SFC funded places would be filled.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Financial Position</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>COURT RECEIVED a report on the financial position for the three months to 31 October 2021, and on the 2021/22 financial position.

Key areas addressed were as follows: running and maintaining current functions, including maintaining current productive capacity; developing new or enhanced functions; and investment to support development and growth.</p>\n<p>Particular progress was highlighted in relation to seeking a partner to develop the University’s online offering, and in relation to developing further international teaching partnerships. These activities focused on expanding areas, where there was evidence of demand and where QMU also had a strong track record.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The plans for the five year Strategy recognised also the increasing importance of commercial activity, some of which would be facilitated by the development of the Edinburgh Innovation Park and Hub. Whilst it was important to operate in a cost- effective way, the Strategy would provide for investment in developing and maintaining productive capacity, including staffing and infrastructure, both physical and digital.</p>\n<p>Court members welcomed the more strategic five year approach and looked forward to a more in-depth discussion at the February Court Strategy Day. It was suggested that it could be helpful to provide some more granular detail on the academic portfolio to help evaluate growth capacity. In relation to this, the Deputy Principal advised that the growth areas identified were premised on developing existing areas of expertise in new markets, rather than moving into new academic disciplines.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

The audit had resulted in a largely positive report, within which a number of areas of good practice were identified. The report also highlighted one area for improvement, this being the need to develop a fully comprehensive risk management process, including a risk escalation process. In making this recommendation, the auditors had acknowledged that many aspects of such a risk management process were already in place, including risk impact thresholds, a tolerance matrix and assessment process.</p>\n<p>The development of the Strategy also included consideration of risk appetite at University level and across strategic risk areas, the latter of which had been the subject of a workshop facilitated by the University’s internal auditors (Azets). This year, the Corporate Risk Register had also been updated to take into account the Risk Management Strategy. The Risk Register now included specific links to the University’s Strategic Plan and suggested acceptable levels of risk for the risk areas identified.</p>\n<p>The main points to note in the Corporate Risk Register were highlighted as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Actions for further control had been reviewed and would now only show where specific additional actions were necessary to manage a risk.</li>\n<li>The revised Risk Register included both reactions to circumstances and risks associated with new activities and developments being undertaken by the University.</li>\n<li>Covid remained the main risk, and the impact of Brexit remained a high risk.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The risk associated with securing student placements had increased. This was due to a combination of the Covid-19 impact and the University being asked to </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">increase activity in allied health profession areas. In response to this latter point, it was noted that programme teams were actively considering alternative placement opportunities to the more traditional NHS settings, for example in care homes. In relation to scheduling placements, the Student President requested that, where </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">possible, Wednesday afternoons be kept free from timetabled activities to allow students to participate in sports and other co- and extra-curricular activities.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Court welcomed the improved clarity within the Risk Register. Members sought clarification on the relationship with the Outcome Agreement, in response to which it was advised that the risk of not complying with Outcome Agreement targets had been carefully considered and was reflected in the Register. The appetite for innovation and investment in environmental and social responsibility was welcomed, although members noted that budget constraints which were referenced explicitly under this area, applied more broadly across the Register.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
