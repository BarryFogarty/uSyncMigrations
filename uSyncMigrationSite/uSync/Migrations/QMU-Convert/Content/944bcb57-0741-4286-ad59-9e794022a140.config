      <Value><![CDATA[<p>In our opinion, the financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>give a true and fair view of the group’s and of the parent institution’s state of affairs as at 31 July 2020 and of the group and parent institution’s income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and changes in reserves and of the group’s statement of cash flows for the year then ended;</li>
<li>have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;</li>
<li>have been properly prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further and Higher Education, and relevant legislation; and</li>
<li>have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and regulation 14 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basis for opinion</strong></p>
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent institution in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.</p>
<p>We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Conclusions relating to going concern</strong></p>
<p>We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the University Court’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or</li>
<li>the University Court has not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the University’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.</li>
</ul>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Other information</strong></p>
<p>The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 2-21, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.The University Court is responsible for the other information.</p>
<p>Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.</p>
<p>In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.</p>
<p>We have nothing to report in this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006</strong></p>
<p>In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:</p>
<ul>
<li>the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial <span style="font-size: 14px;">statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and</span></li>
<li>the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.</li>

<p><strong>Opinion on other matters prescribed by the terms of our engagement</strong></p>
<p>In our opinion, in all material respects:</p>

<p><strong>Matters on which we are required to report by exception</strong></p>
<p>In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.</p>
<p>We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (as amended) requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or</li>
<li>the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or</li>

<p><strong>Responsibilities of the University Court</strong></p>
<p>As explained more fully in the Statement of the Responsibilities of the University Court set out on page 15, the University Court is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the University Court determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</p>
<p>In preparing the financial statements, the University Court is responsible for assessing the University’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the University Court either intends to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><strong>Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements</strong></p>
<p>We have been appointed as auditor under section 44(1)(c) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and under the Companies Act 2006 and report in accordance with regulations made under those Acts.</p>
<p>Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.</p>
<p>This report is made solely to the University Court of Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and with section 44 (1)(c) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and regulation 10 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (as amended). Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the University Court those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh and the University Court as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.</p>
