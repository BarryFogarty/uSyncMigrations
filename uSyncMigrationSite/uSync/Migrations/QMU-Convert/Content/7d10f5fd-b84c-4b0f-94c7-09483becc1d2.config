      "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>You will study for four years to become qualified to work as a primary school teacher. Progression into Year Two will be dependent on successfully completing all modules, a community-based education placement and a reflective report in Year One. If, after the first year you decide not to pursue teaching there is an option to transfer to our Education Studies course. This is a broad based social sciences degree with an emphasis on broader aspects of education.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will learn through lectures, seminars, workshops, enquiry-based, student-led activity, independent study, online group tutorials, school experience/community placements. An innovative feature of the course is the incorporation of outdoor learning skills, as well as the opportunity to undertake a British Sign Language course. Assessment methods are varied, including essays, reports, presentations, blogs and audiovisual submissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p><strong>School experience:</strong> School experience is a core element of the course. You will complete a total of 30 weeks school experience split into three blocks across the four years. School placements are allocated through the Student Placement System (SPS) which is automated and administered by the General Teaching Council, Scotland (GTCS). Placements are allocated by matching students to schools based on information provided by universities, local authorities and schools. Placements are based on a student’s term-time address and students may be required to travel up to 90 minutes each way to a school placement. Students are not permitted to seek placements independently. Students are continually assessed throughout each school experience by maintaining a professional development portfolio. All students are supported on placement by school and university tutors.</p>\n<p><strong>Community experience:</strong> Undertaking a community-based education experience is a unique aspect of this course and enables students to learn about the integration of formal and informal education through a range of community projects. In Year One you will complete a 5-day (or equivalent) community-based education experience. You can engage with a community-based organisation as part of school placement. Students are responsible for sourcing the placement host organisation. To help with the process, we hold a recruitment event on campus to help pair you with a suitable organisation.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>\n<p>For more information, please also visit ‘<a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/how-we-teach-and-how-youll-learn-undergraduate/\" title=\"How we teach and how you'll learn - Undergraduate\">How we teach and how you’ll learn</a>’.</p>\n<p> </p>"
