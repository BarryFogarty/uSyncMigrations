<p>This paper has been crafted to inform sector stakeholders in participatory arts of the results of this research. It collates feedback about the quality approach and tools from organisations and freelance participatory arts practitioners in Scotland, Wales and Portugal for the purpose of sharing among international practitioners in this field the experiences of peers in generating quality outcomes.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>For those already using the toolkits or coming to them for the first time this paper shares insights into how others engaged in similar work have applied this quality approach and where and how they find value in it for their practice.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Respondents in this study have highlighted a desire for more information on how the tools can be used in different contexts (see section 5). In capturing key impacts for best practice and presenting detailed testimonies from many practitioners, it is intended that this paper contributes towards that.</p>

<p>This working paper presents interim findings from a study of how participatory arts practitioners have applied a new holistic model, developed by Rachel Blanche of Queen Margaret University to support quality, that has been implemented in the form of the Is This The Best It Can Be? toolkit and framework in Scotland and the Quality Principles for Wales.</p>
<p>Evidence gathering for this study is ongoing across three countries where the model has been implemented: Scotland, Wales and Portugal. In due course a full analysis and discussion of the findings will be presented in an academic journal publication.</p>
