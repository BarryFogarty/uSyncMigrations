      "content": "<p>If you want to take a broad approach to your learning, you can enrol on our MSc Global Health. This approach offers you a thorough grounding in this multidisciplinary field and you can later decide to specialise your studies if you wish. If you wish to develop a set of relevant practical skills that can be applied to global health  programming and Interventions, you can enrol on our new MSc Applied Global Health. This degree will give you the skills and competencies you need to promote health of populations through contextually appropriate health policies, services and interventions.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can choose a more focused pathway at the outset, with either our MSc Sexual and Reproductive Health or MSc Mental Health and Psychosocial Support. You can also choose to study for one of our PgCert qualifications such as in Health Interventions in Fragile and Conflict Affected Settings or Mental Health and Psychosocial Support. These can be a good option if you have time, work or other commitments that would conflict with studying for a full master’s. We have deliberately designed our courses to be as flexible as possible, so you can apply for the course that best suits your career needs and later revise your choice before progressing to the dissertation  stage (this is subject to you having studied the appropriate modules).</p>\n<p>The global health field has become more complex in the past two decades with the dramatic increase in donor funding channelled through global health initiatives, the rise of more complex patterns of co-morbidity, emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, anti-microbial resistance and the impact of conflict and migration on health and health systems. These issues are targeted through a wide range of health and social development interventions that are implemented by diverse partners in multiple countries and regions of the world. Many global health funding agencies, governments and nongovernmental organisations increasingly seek short-term as well as longer-term consultant advisors and technical experts. Practical expertise in developing, planning, implementing and evaluating both research projects as well as interventions through a range of approaches and methods are essential for graduates hoping to find employment in the applied global health arena. This MSc is geared to provide you with these skills to find employment in global health. This course will equip you the skills and competencies to promote the health of populations in low, middle and high-income countries and settings through the development of effective and relevant health policies, services and interventions.</p>"
