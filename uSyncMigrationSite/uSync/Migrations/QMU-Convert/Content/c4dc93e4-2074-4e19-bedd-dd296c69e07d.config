      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Queen Margaret University (QMU), Edinburgh, is the first higher education institution in the east of Scotland to host the Children’s University, which aims to help school children, aged between seven and 14 years of age (and five and six-year-olds with their families), become confident learners and broaden their horizons.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Hope Wilson (6) from Dalkeith and Cameron Seath (11) from Mayfield, have already signed up to the new initiative, which strives to raise children’s aspirations, encourages them to learn in different ways, and rewards them for taking part in a wide variety of learning activities outside of school hours. The Children’s University ethos is clearly aligned with the aims of the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence in terms of helping children become successful and confident learners, responsible citizens and effective contributors.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Children build up credits the more they engage in learning activities. They can also and can also work towards bronze, silver and gold certificates. The more the children engage in learning activities, the more credits they build up.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Hope attends King’s Park Primary School and Cameron attends Newbattle Community High School, both in Dalkeith. The duo from Midlothian are already becoming junior scholars by taking part in a wide range of fun, educational activities with their parents around Midlothian and beyond, including acting, basketball, singing, tap dancing, ballet and hip hop dancing, as well as taking part in a book bug challenge and science week activities.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Highlights of the Queen Margaret Children’s University for Hope and Cameron include learning about volcanoes on the highest point of Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh, drama and singing at the Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts, discovering new wildlife at Butterfly &amp; Insect World in Lasswade and finding out about local history at the Scottish National Mining Museum in Newtongrange.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Commenting on her experience at the Queen Margaret Children’s University, Hope said: “I really enjoy finding out about new things with my family. The Queen Margaret Children’s University makes learning fun and means I can earn credits at the same time.</p>
<p>“I was surprised how many things you can do and interesting places you can visit on your own doorstep. There’s still a lot I’d like to explore and I’m already getting my friends involved too.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Cameron, added: “The Queen Margaret Children’s University gives you the opportunity to learn new things and is a great way to get awarded for learning new things outside class time. You might surprise yourself by what you end up enjoying.</p>
<p>“I’m keen to learn more about theatre and drama, so I’ve been lucky enough to get some behind the scenes experience at the Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">QMU has taken the lead in establishing the Children’s University in the east of Scotland by initially working in partnership with schools via East and Midlothian Councils.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">For more information on the QMU Children’s University and to sign up, contact Hayley Jones, Children’s University Education Liaison Officer at QMU on 0131 474 0000, ext. 4751 or email <a href="mailto:childrensuniversity@qmu.ac.uk" class="txtMainTextLinks">childrensuniversity@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>]]></Value>
