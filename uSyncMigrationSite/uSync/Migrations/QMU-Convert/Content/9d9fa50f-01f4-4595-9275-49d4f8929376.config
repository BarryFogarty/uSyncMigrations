      <Value><![CDATA[<p>There are countless reasons why our students choose QMU, but we’ve narrowed them down to a top ten list of some of the most common answers…</p>
<p><strong>1. Edinburgh</strong></p>
<p>The capital of Scotland, Edinburgh is one of the most exciting cities to live, work and play in. Steeped in history, Edinburgh seamlessly blends old and new and is the perfect place to experience the sights, sounds and tastes of our diverse and vibrant city. There’s excellent night life if that’s your scene, incredible restaurants and cafes for the foodies among you, theatres and live gigs galore, sports clubs and facilities to get your heart racing, and so much more. Check out what Edinburgh has to offer at <a href="https://edinburgh.org/">edinburgh.org.</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Employability</strong></p>
<p>QMU’s courses are industry relevant, meaning your degree will help you get ‘work ready’ and will make you very attractive to prospective employers.  Our graduates can be found in the NHS, education sector, business, hospitality, TV and film, creative industries, as well as in prominent positions all over the globe. Some of our graduates include BBC Radio’s Edith Bowman, The One Show’s Matt Baker, Ashley Jensen of Extras and Ugly Betty fame, and global superstar Susan Boyle!</p>
<p><strong>3. A family affair</strong></p>
<p>We hear time and time again what a welcoming and close-knit community we have here at QMU. And it’s true! The size of the University means that you’re not just another face in the crowd - your lecturers will know you by name and it’s far easier to get the one-to-one support you might want or need. The campus is also welcoming to the outside community – residents of Musselburgh and beyond come to take advantage of our green spaces and trails for dog walking and running. It really is a mini community in and of itself.</p>
<p><strong>4. A home from home</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><img src="?width=800&amp;height=266.6666666666667" alt="Students watching tv together in QMU Halls" width="800" height="266.6666666666667" data-udi="umb://media/49cf080ac417428185c328994177aaee"></p>
<p>With student residences a stone’s throw away from the academic building, as well as a cracking students’ union, well-equipped gym and sport centre, our campus is a bit like a home away from home. We’ve even got a Starbucks on-site so you can get your caffeine fix while catching up with friends or meeting with your tutors. Studying is always easier with a Caramel Frappuccino! <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/512d9a6851014deba4973b51445a2335}" title="Campus Life" data-udi="umb://document/94ea277eb6b84f6d811abf38af04ee62">Learn more about our campus</a>. </p>
<p><strong>5. “QMU is so supportive”</strong></p>
<p>We get how big a deal it is moving away from home. Whether you’re excited by the prospect, a little apprehensive or absolutely terrified, don’t panic. QMU has lots of ways to support you. Our Res Life programme gives people living in student residences opportunities to socialise and make friends. Student Services offer counselling, a welfare service and mental health support, and our ‘Stay on Course’ initiative provides rapid support to students in struggling to staying on top of their studies. Plus, every student has a personal academic tutor who acts as your go-to person for advice and guidance. Remember, you are not alone! <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/8d6c3c6705754477886a789c3bb955c3}" title="Services for Students" data-udi="umb://document/3a3d373946d84e3983c90f09614c2dc6">More on services for students</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. “Staff are so knowledgeable”</strong></p>
<p>Many of QMU’s academics are internationally recognised in their field of expertise, and all staff are actively engaged with industry. Studying at QMU means you’ll benefit from the latest thinking, innovations, and industry knowledge from those with their finger on the pulse. <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/7b046c038048466cbb4d48133e105cb6}" title="About our Staff" data-udi="umb://document/33b8e740271249288031c5e689d864dc">Check out our staff here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7. Going green</strong></p>
<p><img src="?width=800&amp;height=266.6666666666667" alt="QMU Campus Accommodation Grounds" width="800" height="266.6666666666667" data-udi="umb://media/a5ec1ec1032f4e72bde721510ed3a454"></p>
<p>QMU has taken big strides to reduce our carbon footprint. We know that every little helps to cut down on waste, so we introduced cornstarch cutlery for takeaway meals which are 100% natural and biodegradable. We’ve removed all plastic cups from water stations, and offer discounts for people making use of reusable coffee cups. On a grander scale, our campus set a new benchmark in sustainable design when it opened in 2007. The building maximizes energy efficiency and the landscape design encourages biodiversity. We even use biomass heating! <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/7209d05bd0f84a60ac8ea309da3e77a0}" title="Sustainability" data-udi="umb://document/e725f27a01734cc2a81700a38aefa1ba">Read more about our sustainability</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8. A world of opportunity</strong></p>
<p>From mentoring to awards and scholarships, internships, volunteering and paid work to exchange trips and international travel opportunities, there are tons of incredible and exciting initiatives right at your fingertips when you come to QMU. Taking advantage of these unique experiences can help shape your future career and might even have a life-changing effect on you. They can also be a lot of fun and a really rewarding way to use your time at our University.</p>
<p><strong>9. “QMU really cares”</strong></p>
<p><img src="?width=800&amp;height=266.6666666666667" alt="QMU Staff Member Helping QMU Student" width="800" height="266.6666666666667" data-udi="umb://media/f8aace0e02864d9f85a8844bfae58588"></p>
<p>One of the best feelings in the world is knowing that you’re cared for. That’s something we at QMU aim to do for each of our students. The phrase we hear most often from graduates is ‘At QMU you’re more than just a number’. We want students to know that their experience at our University is important to us and so we go above and beyond to ensure that the needs of our student body are met. Whatever your personal situation and challenges, QMU truly cares and will put steps in place to give you all the support you need to achieve your goals.</p>
<p><strong>10. Make a difference</strong></p>
<p>If you’re looking for a meaningful career, then QMU is the place for you. The University prepares graduates for useful careers and equips them with the skills to make a real difference to society. With a commitment to social justice, recognizing equality and diversity in all that we do, QMU strives to be a university of ideas and influence. We want you to be a part of that!</p>
<p>If any of this resonates with you, why not come along to our next open days to meet with staff and students and see for yourself if QMU is for you?</p>
