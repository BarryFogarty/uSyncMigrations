      "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>This four-year undergraduate Master of Speech and Language Therapy (MSLT)/BSc (Hons) Speech and Language Therapy course will equip you with the expertise and practical skills that you need to work as a registered speech and language therapist. You will thrive in our supportive environment, and benefit from placements each year along with practical experience in our specialist clinical facilities on campus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars, practical workshops and laboratories. Outside these timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a range of assessments throughout the course.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Practice placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will attend placements across Scotland in a variety of settings including hospitals, schools and clinics to ensure you gain a range of experience at various locations. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Typically, in Year One and Two you will complete lifespan placements in an early years and primary setting and a community placement in the voluntary/third sector. You will complete practice placements in Years Two, Three and Four. You will attend a block placement in the summer period between Years Three and Four that is typically completed within a four-week period somewhere in Scotland. Summer placements take place across Scotland and the majority of students are required to travel outside the local area, unless they have exceptional circumstances such as caring responsibilities. It is, therefore likely that students will have to arrange alternative accommodation for the three-week duration of their placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">This four-year undergraduate Master of Speech and Language Therapy (MSLT)/BSc (Hons) Speech and Language Therapy course will equip you with all the knowledge and skills that you need to start a rewarding career as a speech and language therapist. You will learn the theory of speech and language therapy, and placements will immerse you in a variety of clinical environments. We are passionate about original research and you will have the chance to explore an area that inspires you.</span></p>
<p>QMU offers two undergraduate pathways of study in Speech and Language Therapy to achieve a recognised qualification. Initially all students register on the undergraduate master’s pathway and study together, then, from the end of the second year, students on the BSc (Hons) pathway follow a slightly different programme of study to those studying for the undergraduate master’s degree. On graduation, both pathways offer eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a speech and language therapist. </p>
<p>Please see the course structure on this page for more information on the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/">benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>]]></Value>
