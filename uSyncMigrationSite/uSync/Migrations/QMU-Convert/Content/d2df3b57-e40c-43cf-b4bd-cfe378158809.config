      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Adam Roe, 22, who attended Langholm Academy in Langholm graduated on the 10 th July with a BA (Hons) International Hospitality and Tourism from Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh (QMU). At the graduation ceremony, he was surprised to learn that he was also being presented with the Dakota Award for Innovation in Hospitality Dissertations for his intriguing final year dissertation which focused on the niche area of edible insects. The award was presented by Dakota Hotels, as part of its financial sponsorship package to talented students studying on QMU’s hospitality and tourism degree programme. Queen Margaret University recently announced that it had joined forces with a high profile boutique hotel group to provide its students with outstanding employability opportunities and financial support.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Adam has had a busy few months. Not only has he been working hard to complete his degree, he was also elected as Vice President of the Queen Margaret University Students’ Union in March and took up his new position in June. </p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The 22 year old was joined by his mother Michele Lowe, sister Abbie Roe and his mother's partner Kenny Derbyshire at an impressive ceremony in the Usher Hall in central Edinburgh. His new role as Student Vice President meant that Adam took his place in the academic procession at both graduation ceremonies held that day.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Delighted with his graduation achievement and his Dakota Hotel award, Adam said: “QMU has been the best experience of my life so far. Unlike larger universities, QMU offers a student learning experience which includes being part of a small community. You don’t get lost in the crowd.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Adam continued: “Through further progression of my passion for sport, academic development and active participation in community projects I have developed bonds with a whole group of friends. Now that I have graduated, I am delighted that I can also consider many of my lecturers as friends – people whom I can rely on for future support. I would highly recommend QMU as a unique place to study and one that offers an excellent student experience.</p>
<p>“It is now time for me to give something back to QMU. Through my new role as Vice President Iaim to increase student participation in sport and activities, ultimately enhancing the student experience on campus.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Marc Robertson, Programme Leader for the BA (Hons) International Hospitality and Tourism degree said: “We are very proud of Adam’s achievement. He has been an excellent student who  has contributed to the University in so many ways – academically and socially. We are pleased that he was selected as the first recipient of the Dakota Hotels Innovation Award for the sterling work he did on his final year dissertation.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Marc Robertson concluded: “We are delighted to have the support of Dakota Hotels. The group is currently offering a range of support packages and internships for QMU hospitality and tourism students. This partnership development makes an important contribution to QMU’s links with industry and helps to strengthen its already robust employability strategy. Importantly, it also provides much needed financial support to our students and provides an element of recognition for their hard work and achievements.” </p>]]></Value>
