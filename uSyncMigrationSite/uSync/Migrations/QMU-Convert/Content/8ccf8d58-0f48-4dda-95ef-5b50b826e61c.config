      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. Interpretation:</strong> Defined terms in these Tenancy Terms and Conditions shall have the same meaning as those specified in the Contract / Tenancy Letter unless specifically stated as otherwise and the Contract/Tenancy Letter (incorporating these Tenancy Terms and Conditions) constitute the "Tenancy Agreement".</p>
<p>2. Prepayment: The Tenant shall pay a £250.00 sterling prepayment with the accepted Contract / Tenancy Letter. The prepayment secures the Accommodation and is deducted from the total Rent due for the full Occupancy Period. This prepayment is NOT a tenancy deposit for the purpose of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006. The Tenant will be charged and invoiced separately for any damages occurring throughout the period of residency. The Landlord accepts payment by bank transfer, credit and debit card.</p>
<p>The Prepayment of £250.00 is non refundable in the event of the Tenant not taking up the allocated Accommodation or the Tenant vacating the Accommodation prior to the Occupancy End Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Landlord reserves the right to pursue the Tenant for any outstanding amounts due under the terms of the Tenancy Agreement.</p>
<p>No interest shall be paid by the Landlord to the Tenant for the prepayment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Payment:</strong> Rent is payable in instalments as notified by the Tenant to the Landlord prior to moving in. If the Tenant elects to pay in two instalments, the rent is payable prior to or on 1st September and 5th January each year. Payment may be made by bank transfer, debit or credit card to the Landlord. Please do not send cash through the post. Alternatively, if the Tenant elects to pay in eight instalments, payment may be made through a direct debit arrangement.</p>
<p>If the Tenant elects to pay for accommodation by semester, rent due for Semester 1 must be paid at time of acceptance of the Contract, and the Prepayment must also be paid by the Acceptance Date specified in the Contract / Tenancy Letter. Payment of Rent for Semester 2 must be paid on or before 5 th January each year. A penalty fee may be charged if payment for Semester 2 Rent is not received by the Landlord by the due date.</p>
<p>If paying for accommodation by direct debit, the completed Direct Debit mandate form (available on the eAccommodation Portal) should be provided to the Landlord on or before arrival, but the Prepayment must be paid to the Landlord by the Acceptance Date specified in the Contract / Tenancy Letter.</p>
<p>Failure to pay the Rent in full, together with any other charges payable by the Tenant in terms of the Tenancy Agreement, may result in the Tenant not being allowed to re-matriculate or graduate until the debt has been cleared. The Landlord also reserves the right to evict the Tenant for persistent non-payment of accommodation fees. The Tenant must not reduce any payment of the accommodation charges by making any deduction for it or by setting any sum against it for any reason.</p>
<p>The accommodation charges set out in the Contract/Tenancy Letter shall include normal residential use of electricity. The Landlord reserves the right to recharge the Tenant for nonresidential, unreasonable or excessive use of such service.</p>
<p>4.1. Period of the Tenancy Agreement and Accommodation: The Room / Flat (as notified to the Tenant prior to moving in and herein referred to as the “Accommodation”) within the block of the Halls of Residence (the "Building") is let to the Tenant for a fixed period as specified in the Contract / Tenancy Letter. The period of the Tenancy Agreement runs through the Christmas and Easter holidays and is independent of the semester dates which can vary by course.</p>
<p>In accepting the Tenancy Agreement, the Tenant is agreeing to pay the full Rent from the Occupancy Start Date to the Occupancy End Date (as detailed in the Contract / Tenancy Letter) as well as any additional amounts due for accommodation requirements that start before the Occupancy Start Date or end after the Occupancy End Date.</p>
<p>The Accommodation is let to the Tenant in accordance with Section 1 and Schedule 1 Paragraph 3 of the Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016.</p>
<p>The Tenant accepts the Accommodation in a clean, tidy and good and tenantable condition at the Occupancy Start Date.</p>
<p>4.2. The Landlord reserves the right to relocate the Tenant from the Accommodation on management grounds to alternative accommodation which is of a standard broadly comparable with the Accommodation and which is in an area from which there is reasonable access to Queen Margaret University’s Craighall Campus of no more than 25 minutes.</p>
<p>4.3. If the Accommodation is unavailable for occupation in terms of the Tenancy Agreement and the Landlord has not provided alternative accommodation in terms of Condition 4.2 above (or emergency sleeping accommodation), then the Tenant shall be entitled to a rebate of rent equivalent to the period that the Accommodation is unavailable.</p>
<p>5. Leaving Halls of Residence: As stated, the Accommodation is leased to the Tenant for a fixed period. If the Tenant remains a matriculated student of Queen Margaret University (“QMU”) (or if applicable such other higher or further education establishment) and chooses to leave the Halls of Residence before the Occupancy End Date as detailed in the Contract / Tenancy Letter, the Tenant will remain liable for the full Rent together with any other charges payable by the Tenant in terms of the Tenancy Agreement. If in spite of this, the Tenant chooses to live elsewhere, the Tenant is obligated to formally advise the Landlord of the Tenant’s new address and date of departure in writing prior to vacating.</p>
<p>6.1 If the Tenant formally withdraws from QMU, whether voluntarily or as a result of being required to withdraw from their course, and ceases his/her course of study at QMU, the Tenancy Agreement shall be terminated and the Tenant must formally advise the Landlord in writing prior to the Tenant’s leaving. To do this the Tenant must formally complete a “Withdrawal Request” form prior to departure. The Tenant will remain liable for the rental due for the full Occupancy Period except in the event that the Tenant formally withdraws from QMU prior to the end of Semester One. In the circumstance that the Tenant formally withdraws from QMU and vacates their Accommodation during Semester One, the Tenant will be liable for the rental due up until the start of Semester Two only together with any other charges payable by the Tenant in terms of the Tenancy Agreement. It should be expressly understood that no further financial concessions shall be made available in lieu of failure to complete the full Occupancy Period detailed at Condition 3 above. Failure to advise the Landlord in writing (using the correct “Withdrawal Request” form) of intended withdrawal from the Halls of Residence will result in the continued application of Rent and all other charges.</p>
<p>6.2 If the Tenant is a student at another higher or further education establishment and the Tenant formally withdraws from such other higher or further education establishment whether voluntarily or as a result of being required to withdraw from their course, and ceases his / her course of study the Tenancy Agreement shall be terminated and the Tenant must formally advise the Landlord in writing prior to the Tenant’s leaving. To do this the Tenant must formally complete a “Withdrawal from Residence” form prior to departure. In this circumstance, the Tenant will remain liable for the rental due for the full Tenancy Period. However, at the Landlord’s discretion where the Tenant is able to find a replacement Tenant from outside the Halls of Residence, charges may be limited to the Rent due up to the next semester together with any other charges payable by the Tenant in terms of the Tenancy Agreement. It should be expressly understood that no further financial concessions shall be made available in lieu of failure to complete the full occupation period detailed at Condition 3 above. Failure to advise the Landlord in writing (using the correct “Withdrawal from Residence” form) of intended withdrawal from such higher or further education establishment will result in the continued application of Rent and all other charges.</p>
<p><strong>7. Damage:</strong> The Tenant shall be held jointly and severally responsible and charged for any loss or damage caused to any part of the Halls of Residence (which expression shall in this Tenancy Agreement for the avoidance of doubt include the Building and the Accommodation where applicable) which may be attributed to him / her or his / her guests. If this arises in shared lockable communal areas (such as kitchens or landings) and no individual can be positively identified then the Landlord may levy appropriate charges jointly and severally between the key holders of such areas.</p>
<p>The amount levied shall be determined by the Landlord and shall reflect the expenditure necessitated. Individuals or groups of key holders will be advised in writing if domes tic standards fail to meet with the minimum required. If the areas identified are not cleaned and tidied to the satisfaction of the Landlord within 24 hours of the issue of a second notice, arrangements may be made to rectify the situation with charges being passed on to the key holders of the area who shall be held jointly and severally liable. In certain circumstances the Landlord may in addition withdraw access to areas which are not being maintained to a satisfactory standard.</p>
<p><strong>8. Overnight Visitors:</strong> These are usually permitted but only by prior formal arrangement with the Landlord, whose decision is final. Maximum stay is 3 nights in any 4 week period. The Tenant is responsible at all times for the conduct of all visitors brought onto the QMU campus or into the Halls of Residence.</p>
<p><strong>9. General:</strong> The Landlord accepts no responsibility for the Tenant’s personal belongings. The Tenant is covered by basic contents insurance provided through Endsleigh Insurance by Queen Margaret University for the period of the Tenancy Agreement. The cover is subject to the conditions, exclusions, limitations and excesses of the policy. The Tenant is expressly advised to ensure that he / she has adequate level of cover by consulting the Endsleigh Insurance website prior to arrival.</p>
<p>If the Tenant brings a television into the Halls of Residence the Tenant is responsible for obtaining a television licence.</p>
<p>Smoking (including the use of electronic cigarettes or vape devices) is not permitted in any part of the Halls of Residence at any time.</p>
<p>The Tenant must occupy the Accommodation that he / she has been formally allocated. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tenant is not entitled at any time during the period of the Tenancy Agreement to change the room that they have been formally allocated. The Landlord may in certain circumstances re-allocate rooms (especially if the Tenant requires an extended stay on account of a longer than standard course) and reserves the right to move a Tenant if required.</p>
<p>The correct postal address is:</p>
<p>Your Name<br />Block / Flat Number / Room Number<br />Student Residences<br />Queen Margaret University<br />Musselburgh<br />East Lothian<br />EH21 6UD</p>
<p>The Landlord is bound by the Data Protection Act 1998 (which includes all subsequent enactments, amendments and modifications relating to the Data Protection Act 1998). The personal information you provide will be held and processed according to this Act. This information will be used by the Landlord to fulfil its part of the contract between it and the student. Information will not be disclosed to any other third parties unless required by law or in an emergency.</p>
<p>10. The Tenant is, in addition to the obligations detailed within the Tenancy Agreement, also obliged to comply at all times with the Halls of Residence Code of Conduct as may be amended from time to time (a copy of which is attached hereto and which forms part of the Tenancy Agreement) and is bound by the Halls of Residence Disciplinary Policy and Procedure as may be amended from time to time (a copy of which is attached hereto and which forms part of the Tenancy Agreement). In the event of any inconsistency between the Halls of Residence Code of Conduct, the Halls of Residence Disciplinary Policy and Procedure and these Tenancy Terms and Conditions, these Tenancy Terms and Conditions shall prevail.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, if the Tenant breaches these Tenancy Terms and Conditions of the Tenancy Agreement and / or without prejudice to the foregoing generality the Halls of Residence Code of Conduct, the Tenant will be subject to discipline in accordance with the terms of the Halls of Residence Disciplinary Policy and Procedure. The Landlord reserves the right to remove a Tenant from the Accommodation and relocate to another room where there has been a serious breach of these Tenancy Terms and Conditions and/or the Halls of Residence Code of Conduct or where the Landlord considers it reasonably necessary to protect the Tenant’s welfare or the welfare of other residents or to prevent damage to the Accommodation.</p>
<p>11. If the Tenant has chosen to accept alcohol-free accommodation, the Tenant agrees not to drink alcohol within the flat. If the Tenant is found to break this agreement, a first and final written warning will be issued to the Tenant. If the Tenant is found to be drinking alcohol within the flat for a second time the Tenant will be moved to another room at the Landlord's discretion. The Tenant will be held responsible for their guests and/or visitors complying with these conditions while they are in the Tenant’s flat.</p>

THIS SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE LANDLORD FROM PURSUING THE TENANT FOR ANY OUTSTANDING DEBTS OR APPLYING CHARGES FOR ANY DAMAGE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TENANT. THE LANDLORD SPECIFICALLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ADMISSION INTO RESIDENCE TO THE TENANT IF ITS RENT ACCOUNT IS IN ARREARS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>13. The Tenant Will Need to Bring (as a minimum):</strong> All necessary bedlinen, duvet, pillows, towels as well as all equipment for the self-catered kitchen, e.g. crockery, cutlery and cooking implements (pots, pans, knives, tin-openers, etc). Some of the rooms are doublebedded, the allocation of which will be notified to the Tenant in advance. The Tenant may prefer to purchase some of the above locally on arrival. The Landlord does not have any bed linen, nor catering equipment to loan.</p>
<p><strong>14. Major Conditions of Contract</strong>: For the avoidance of doubt the following major conditions are accepted by the Tenant as is evidenced by his/her signing of the agreement:</p>
<p>The Tenancy Agreement is for a fixed period and the duration of the period is not negotiable. No rebates or discounts whatsoever are available (save as provided in Conditions 4.3 and 6) even if the Tenant is away from the Halls of Residence for any length of time, including attendance on academic placement which may involve additional expense if the Tenant’s placement is away from Edinburgh and the Tenant has to reside elsewhere to pursue the Tenant’s placement commitments.</p>
<p>If the Tenant chooses to reside away from Halls of Residence for any reason and for any length of time whatsoever, the Tenant must inform the Landlord in writing prior to departure and may be required to return all the issued keys until the Tenant uplifts them on return. Access to the accommodation block will also be restricted on the Tenant’s smart card during such period.</p>
<p>If in spite of accepting the Contract / Tenancy Letter the Tenant decides to live permanently elsewhere, the Tenant must inform the Landlord in writing and complete a “Withdrawal from Residence” form. In addition, the Tenant must return all keys to the Landlord prior to changing address. At this point, access to the Building will be restricted on the Tenant’s smart card. The Tenant will remain liable for all Rent and other charges payable pursuant to the Tenancy Agreement.</p>
<p>The Landlord reserves the right to attempt to re-allocate accommodation to another occupant where the Tenant has not completed the check-in procedures by the Occupancy Start Date. If the Tenant arrives late and has not arrived by the official start in Semester 1, the Tenant will be held liable for Rent from the Occupancy Start Date.</p>
<p><strong>15. When to Arrive / Depart:</strong> Prior to the Occupancy Start Date, the tenant must fully complete the online accommodation induction and book a timeslot for arrival on or after the Occupancy Start Date.</p>
<p>The Occupancy Start Date has been set prior to most course inductions. There are however a few exceptions which apply to some courses where the actual semester start or pre-semester induction commences earlier or later. Please check the information supplied from QMU. If the Tenant is due to start before the Occupancy Start Date please inform the Landlord at point of application. The Landlord does not accept any other earlier arrivals. Please note that the Tenant is bound to pay the full residence Rent detailed in the Contract / Tenancy Letter and the Tenant may prefer to arrive on the Occupancy Start Date even if the Tenant’s course induction is after the Occupancy Start Date.</p>
<p>All Accommodation must be vacated (with all personal effects and belongings removed, the Accommodation delivered up in a good tenantable repair and condition, free from damage and clean and tidy) and keys / smart cards returned to Accommodation Services by 10.00 a.m. on the Occupancy End Date.</p>
<p>The Tenant agrees that the Landlord may remove, store, sell or otherwise dispose of any personal possessions which have been left in the Accommodation at the end of the Occupancy Period, and the Tenant will reimburse the Landlord for any costs incurred in doing so.</p>
<p>If the Tenant’s course ends after the Occupancy End Date, the Tenant may be given the option to extend the period of the Tenancy Agreement (an "Extended Stay"). An Extended Stay will be negotiated prior to the end of the Tenancy Agreement. An Extended Stay will be invoiced separately and are charged at a weekly rate. Also, please note it is not always possible to guarantee that the Tenant will stay in the same Accommodation, especially for an Extended Stay.</p>
<p><strong>16. Keys:</strong> Keys and temporary smart cards for the Accommodation shall be provided on date of arrival. For security reasons it is imperative that any loss of keys / smart cards be reported to the Landlord immediately. A charge shall be levied in respect of any replacement key / smart cards issued – this charge to be reviewed annually and displayed in the Accommodation reception. If at the Occupancy End Date a Tenant does not return the keys before leaving, the prevailing fee per key will be charged to the Tenant.</p>
<p><strong>17. Mail:</strong> The Landlord will accept delivery of the Tenant’s parcels and mail in accordance with its Mail Service for Residents policy which the Tenant accepts by entering into this Tenancy Agreement. Whilst every effort will be made to store parcels securely and safely, the Landlord cannot accept liability for any damage to or loss from any parcels accepted and held on behalf of the Tenant. The Tenant must inform the Landlord, in writing, if they do not accept the Mail Service for Residents policy and the Landlord will not accept delivery of parcels addressed to the Tenant.</p>
<p><strong>18. Access:</strong> The Tenant agrees to grant access to the Landlord or their agents at reasonable times to the Accommodation in order to allow them to carry out periodic repairs, maintenance or inspection of the Accommodation and contents. It is also agreed that the Tenant shall have the right to be present at inspection.</p>
<p><strong>19. Multiple Occupancy:</strong> It is a condition of the Tenancy Agreement that the Accommodation is let to the Tenant and that no overnight visitors other than those approved in terms of Condition 8 of these Tenancy Terms and Conditions are acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>20. Destruction or damage of the subjects:</strong> If the Accommodation or any part of the Building on which the Accommodation relies becomes unfit for use during the Occupancy Period, a just proportion of the charges will cease to be payable; this is to be dependent upon the extent of the damage sustained and the time that the area is unfit for use. This Condition will not apply if the cause of the damage is in any way the result of action taken by the Tenant; this is to include any failure to notify the Landlord or repairs required.</p>
<p><strong>21. Termination Landlord:</strong></p>
<p>21.1. The Landlord may terminate this Tenancy Agreement by serving written notice to quit on the Tenant. The Landlord may serve such notice either:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">21.1.1. to terminate this Tenancy Agreement at expiry of the Occupancy Period;<br />21.1.2. to terminate the Tenancy Agreement where the Tenant has failed to perform any of its obligations under this Tenancy Agreement;<br />21.1.3. to terminate this Tenancy Agreement if the Tenant ceases to be a student enrolled in full time education;<br />21.1.4. to terminate the Tenancy Agreement if the Tenant is excluded or suspended from the Halls of Residence in accordance with the Halls of Residence – Disciplinary Policy and Procedure; or<br />21.1.5. the Tenant is excluded or suspended from the University in accordance with the Regulations Governing Discipline for students.</p>
<p>21.2. In the event that the Tenant fails to remove from the Accommodation at the end of the period specified in the notice to quit, the Landlord can bring legal action against the Tenant to recover possession of the Accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>22. Tenant Acknowledgements:</strong> In signing this Tenancy Agreement and taking entry to the Accommodation, the Tenant:</p>
<p>22.1. confirms that it has made full and true disclosure of all information sought by the Landlord in connection with this Agreement;<br />22.2. confirms that it has not knowingly or carelessly made any false or misleading statements (whether written or oral) which might affect the Landlord's decision to enter into this Agreement; and<br />22.3. confirms that they are a student enrolled in full time education or will be at the commencement of the Agreement and must inform the Landlord immediately if this ceases to be the case.<br />22.4. acknowledges that this Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>23. Notices:</strong> Any notices to be served on the Tenant shall be valid if delivered to the Accommodation or sent to the Tenant’s University email address. Any notices to be served on the Landlord shall be valid if posted or delivered to the address of the Landlord as stated in the Tenancy / Contract Letter (or any replacement address subsequently notified in writing by the Landlord to the Tenant). In either case service shall be deemed to have been effected on the day of delivery or, in the case of posting), 2 working days after the date of posting.</p>]]></Value>
