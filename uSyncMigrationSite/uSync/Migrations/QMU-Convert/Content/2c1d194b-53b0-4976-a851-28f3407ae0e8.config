      "content": "<p>Are you technically minded with an equally strong interest in person-centred care? Are you ready to make a difference? Therapeutic radiography is a rewarding profession that brings together care and technological expertise. It is the skilled application of controlled amounts of radiation to treat medical conditions, mainly cancer and other types of tumour. Therapeutic radiographers work alongside other specialties to create complex treatment plans and deliver precise radiation treatment.</p>\n<p>Therapeutic radiographers work with patients every day to help improve their care and their lives. Therapeutic radiographers are a part of a patient’s journey, from initial referral through planning and treatment to the post-treatment review. Therapeutic radiographers are a valued member of a multidisciplinary team providing a person-centred service.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>be equipped with the knowledge, understanding and critical thinking skills you need in this rewarding career, providing cancer treatment and care in the NHS and the private sector;</li>\n<li>develop your expertise through in-depth theoretical learning, clinical placements each year, and the close support of our very experienced staff; and</li>\n<li>benefit from the interprofessional working focus of this course. We aim for all our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member.\n<p><strong>A short video about this course</strong></p>\n<div class=\"mceNonEditable embeditem\" data-embed-url=\"https://youtu.be/JGbzd0QXMH8\" data-embed-height=\"561\" data-embed-width=\"950\" data-embed-constrain=\"true\"><iframe width=\"950\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGbzd0QXMH8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Train to be a Therapeutic Radiographer with Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>What are the differences between diagnostic and therapeutic radiography?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"mceNonEditable embeditem\" data-embed-url=\"https://youtu.be/zkbz8kpOLHI\" data-embed-height=\"561\" data-embed-width=\"950\" data-embed-constrain=\"true\"><iframe width=\"950\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zkbz8kpOLHI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"What are the differences between diagnostic and therapeutic radiography?\"></iframe></div>\n</li>\n</ul>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>During your first two years, you’ll join a diverse cohort of students, exploring the fundamental principles of therapeutic radiography and gain hands-on practice experience through placement-based learning within health and social care.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will move on to either the BSc (Hons) or the undergraduate master’s pathway depending on your aspirations and performance. Both pathways develop professional skills, knowledge and attributes through a combination of university and placement-based learning. The undergraduate master’s offer an opportunity to delve deeper into areas such as leadership, service improvement, research and public health, at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Upon graduation, both pathways lead to eligibility for registration with the HCPC, opening doors to a fulfilling career in therapeutic radiography.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical workshops. There will be a mix of classroom and online learning. Outside timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of assessment methods (eg written and practical exams, written assignments, presentations and viva voce) at the end of each module.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will complete practice placements in each year. You will attend a variety of placements within the NHS at various locations across Scotland. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern specialist spaces for use by both our <strong>Master of Radiography: Therapeutic (MRad)</strong> and <strong>MSc Therapeutic Radiography (Pre-Registration)</strong> courses. We have a range of equipment available to simulate different aspect of the clinical environment.  Our clinical rooms include positioning lasers and a range of immobilisation equipment to allow us to replicate patient positioning and set up scenarios.  We also have our computer planning suite which allow us plan radiotherapy treatments, explore image verification and patient management. Students have access to numerous anatomical models which are incorporated into their learning during practical sessions and can be used during self-directed study sessions.</p>\n<p>You can view a 'Specialist Facilities' film further down the page.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>\n<p>For more information, please also visit ‘<a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/how-we-teach-and-how-youll-learn-undergraduate/\"><strong>How we teach and how you’ll learn</strong></a>’.</p>"

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Therapeutic radiographers specialise in the planning, administration and aftercare of radiotherapy treatment for patients, most of whom have cancer and tumours. This four year undergraduate master's/BSc (Hons) degree course will give you the theoretical understanding and practical skills you will need to build a rewarding career as a therapeutic radiographer. Practice placements are an integrated part of the course and allow you to put your theoretical knowledge into practice.</span></p>
<p>Whether you aspire to achieve a BSc (Hons) or an undergraduate master’s degree, we’ll guide you every step of the way. Please see the course structure section on this page for more information on the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/">benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>]]></Value>
