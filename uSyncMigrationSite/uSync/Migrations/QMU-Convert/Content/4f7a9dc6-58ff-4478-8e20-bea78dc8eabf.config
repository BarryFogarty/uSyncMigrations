The focus is on learning how to acquire and utilise knowledge for yourself, through identifying existing knowledge as well as discovering new knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Our courses enhance a wide range of transferable skills that will open up an array of job options</strong>. You will be supported to improve your interpersonal and presentation skills, develop effective reading and writing skills, engage in analytical thinking and critical reflection, as well as focus on the development of your research skills.

<p>You will be assessed via traditional exams and essays, but also through scientific reports, critical reviews, and live multimedia presentations and poster presentations. In the later stages of your course, you will be able to develop an emerging area of expertise to give you an edge in future employment or study.</p>
