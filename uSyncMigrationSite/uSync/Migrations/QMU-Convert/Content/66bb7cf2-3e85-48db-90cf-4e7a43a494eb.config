      <Value><![CDATA[<p>So my adventure begins in Toronto where I explored the big city near where I would call home for the next few months. The sun was still shinning on my arrival and over the next few months the weather would remain the same which is not like the average Canadian summer.</p>
<p>Brock university is located near various walks which I explored with some friends on the sunny days we were lucky to have in September. We had a nice walk to decew falls where some of the group decided to got down the falls and some of us remained and relaxed in the late summer heat.</p>
<p>The activities and events Brock put on for the international students for example a trip to a winery and to Niagara falls was an opportunity I could not miss. Trying the local wine and unique ice wine was one of a life time opportunity I could not miss and get myself in for. Since being in Canada I have been lucky enough to visit Niagara falls 3 times and each time was both interesting and different. From a sunny hot day to a cold walk looking at the Christmas lights. Each time was both enjoyable and something I will remember for a long time.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester I went to homecoming which was a hockey game that Brock university were playing in. The atmosphere was incredible and something which was unique to be immersed in.</p>
<p>During reading week i discovered another part of Canada. I went to Ottawa in the french speaking region of Canada. It was completely different to the Canada I was already aware of.The scenery was incredible as it was mostly provinces and parks. I went to algonquin park which was a lot bigger than I first anticipated. The contrast of Canada and the UK in terms of celebrating Halloween is incomparable as Canada produce a tray of unique pumpkins and produce that we do not. As this year Canada are Celebrating 150 years that have various different events happening one of which was a beautiful flower sculptures just at the boundary of Ontario and Quebec which consists of sculptures of Chinese dragons and a grand piano.</p>
<p>A weekend trip to Toronto was a must do for me. We spent the weekend shopping, exploring and eating food. We discovered the beautiful city and all the unique things it holds. The coincidence that we were in Toronto when they had chocolate exhibition was something we could not pass. when we explored Toronto we went to various places like St Lawrence market which was full of unique and tasty produce, the Eaton shopping centre, the harbour and Toronto sign.</p>
<p>We knew we would be returning in a few weeks before exams start to explore the recommended Christmas market. Which was not a disappointment as we were able to taste Canadian specialities such as maple fudge. This was a good way to conclude my unique and incredible experience in Canada I will never forget.</p>]]></Value>
