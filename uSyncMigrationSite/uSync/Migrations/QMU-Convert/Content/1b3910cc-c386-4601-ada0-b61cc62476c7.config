There is specific focus on expressive musicianship throughout the programme combined with musical flexibility and improvisatory skill.  So, whether you are a singer, instrumentalist or beatmaker, your technical musical skills will be assessed on an individual basis and considered in relation to your personal characteristics. Specific exam grades are not required.</p>\n<p>Added to this, one year (or equivalent) of relevant experience working with persons in the community, education or health settings is required. This does not need to be music related and should be in addition to any experience gained during an undergraduate degree. </p>\n<p>For international applicants, with English as your second language, you will be required to provide evidence of your English language, with an overall IELTS score of 7.0 or more, and with no individual component scoring less than 6.5. This is not necessary if you have an honours degree that was studied in English.</p>"

If your application is successful, and the course is full, you will be offered a place on a waiting list.</p>\n<p><strong>When are interviews? </strong></p>\n<p>If your application is successful, you will be invited to interview at the University. They normally take place between January and June. For more information, contact: <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> </p>\n<p><strong>What is the mode of attendance? </strong></p>\n<p>There are two fifteen-week semesters in each year: September – December; January – May.</p>\n<p>In Level 1 (1<sup>st</sup> year) students attend two days at University (Tuesday and Wednesday) and one day (any other day, Mon-Fri) each week on practice placement.</p>\n<p>In Level 2 (2<sup>nd</sup> year) students attend one day at University (Thursday) and two days each week on practice placement (any other days, Mon-Fri).</p>\n<p><strong>Can I work at the same time? </strong></p>\n<p>Although attendance at University and practice placement is part-time (3 days/ week in each year) the programme is full-time so you are required to make up the hours for independent study (equivalent to 2 days/ week).</p>\n<p><strong>Can I do the programme by distance-learning? </strong></p>\n<p>Some aspects of the programme can be studied online and there is much self-directed study. However, attendance at University is compulsory due to the necessity of interpersonal and experiential components.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a part-time route to MSc Music Therapy?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no part time route at the moment. It is offered as a full-time 2 year, fast-track pre-registration (HCPC) programme.</p>\n<p><strong>Who organises practice placements? </strong></p>\n<p>Practice Placements are arranged and allocated by the Professional Practice Tutor at QMU. Students are not expected to find their own placements. Before Level 1 and Level 2, students are invited to complete a form to indicate choice, previous experience and address during Semesters. Wherever possible, practice placements are arranged in, or near to, the city where the student lives but this is also balanced by each student’s learning needs and preferences, which are all taken into consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Are all the practice placements in Scotland?</strong></p>\n<p>We have approved placement sites in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Aberdeen and many other areas in Scotland, but also in England, Northern Ireland and Ireland. Students are placed in a site that we consider will offer the best learning experience. Our good links with managers at various practice placement settings around the UK and Ireland mean that we can aim to offer all students a placement that makes sense geographically.</p>\n<p><strong>What kinds of practice placements are offered?</strong></p>\n<p>The range of practice placements are extensive including placements within hospitals, schools, voluntary sector organisations, child and family centres, drug and alcohol services, hospices, community based health centres, community based mental health teams, day centres for the elderly and for adults with physical and/or learning disabilities. The range of practice placements for Music Therapy students changes from year to year.</p>\n<p><strong>Who supervises practice placement? </strong></p>\n<p>In Level 1, all students are supervised by a music therapist who works on-site. In Level 2, students have the opportunity to work more autonomously and often in a setting where there has previously been no Music Therapy. They are supervised by another professional who works in the setting.</p>\n<p>All students receive weekly clinical supervision at University in small groups and attendance to these is a co-requisite of practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong>When should I start personal psychotherapy?</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to attend personal psychodynamic psychotherapy for the duration of the MSc Music Therapy programme (as all HCPC registered programmes in the UK) and to show evidence of at least 40 hours throughout the 2 year programme. Responsibility for finding a therapist rests with the student and ideally should be in place for the start of the programme.</p>\n<p>In general students are advised to work with a therapist whose orientation is compatible with the psychodynamic orientation of the programme, with a minimum of 5 years’ experience, and registered with UKCP or BACP. Further details are given when students matriculate.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the programme fees?</strong> </p>\n<p>See the Fees and Funding button on the programme website for fees and updated information on possible student funding.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any other costs? </strong></p>\n<p>Fees for personal psychotherapy range on average from £40-60 per session. It is important to bear this additional expense in mind and budget for it.</p>\n<p>All music therapists, including trainees, must have personal indemnity insurance.</p>\n<p>Travel costs to placement are not covered.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there grants, trusts or scholarships for the programme?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no grants available but international students can apply for a QMU scholarship. Some students have sought funding from other sources by consulting information on Education Awards in their local library. Other students have obtained a Career Development Loan from their bank, or received part funding from their employers.</p>\n<p><strong>Do full fees need to be paid at the outset of the academic year?</strong></p>\n<p>No, there are other options. See the QMU website for further details.  </p>\n<p><strong>What sort of tutorial support is available to students? </strong></p>\n<p>Each student on the programme has a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT). The role of the Personal Academic Tutor is to help students integrate the different parts of the progamme, review their work and be aware of any circumstances affecting the student’s learning on the programme. Students meet with their Personal Academic Tutor at least once each semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there support within University for students with disabilities?</strong></p>\n<p>A member of the programme team is an academic disability student coordinator and will meet with students to discuss requirements and offer advice in liaison with the academic disability services. For example students with dyslexia may be advised how to be assessed, where to find technological support, and what sorts of extra support is available.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there help with writing? </strong></p>\n<p>The team within the <a data-udi=\"umb://document/6d3ed42576e3439c9795996e7243cdb5\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/e2cf0dcc90fc4d35884f11705becdf64}\" title=\"Effective Learning Service (ELS)\">Effective Learning Services at QMU</a> offer workshops for all students and on every aspect of academic study, including essay preparation. Tutorials are also offered for students whose first language is not English. </p>\n<p><strong>What support is offered to international students before the programme begins?</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend<a data-udi=\"umb://document/d1c2af821496461fa8204fa9afb698d4\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/4b2aea00b4484c2db6777532e958a802}\" title=\"Pre-sessional Courses\"> pre-sessional programmes to all applicants whose first language is not English</a>. These are FREE and there are 2 options: a 12 week programme from mid-June, and a 4 week programme from mid-August.</p>\n<p><strong>How many students are in each cohort? </strong></p>\n<p>There are up to 25 students in each cohort however workshops, supervision and tutorials are in small groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Do most students find employment after they graduate?</strong></p>\n<p>Our graduates have a high level of employment with some students creating a post from their practice placement in Level 2.</p>\n<p>Employment opportunities vary, with some regions of the UK offering more employment possibilities for qualified music therapists than others.</p>\n<p>Students are offered classes with the Careers Adviser for the School of Health Sciences, to help explore careers options and think about how to approach employment upon graduation, including mock interviews. Students are encouraged to make the most of their local networks, which in turn promote employment.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the research interests of the staff?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see the <a data-id=\"3548\" href=\"/{localLink:3548}\" title=\"OTAT Staff\">staff</a> member's details on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I find out more about Music Therapy? </strong></p>\n<p>Join British Association for Music Therapy.
