      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Drawing on the success of creative ‘hubs’ and ‘incubators’, the two-year multi-disciplinary programme will be open to those who have successfully completed an HND in a range of creative industries subjects, including Jewellery, Photography, Interior Design and Computer Animation. </p>
<p>Students will continue to develop their creative practice under the guidance of a mentor while undertaking modules that explore finance, marketing, design thinking, project management, and social enterprise. </p>
<p>The course, delivered at the College’s Glenrothes Campus, will be led by staff with international enterprising business experience in the creative industries. Their lived experience will ensure that all of the content is tailored towards the realities of working as a freelancer or running a small business within the creative industries. </p>
<p>From day one, students will be encouraged to start developing their business and each module has been designed to support them in creating a business model that will work. As such, in the final year, students will also create a fully developed business plan rather than a dissertation for their honours project. </p>
<p>Dougi McMillan, Director of Creative industries at Fife College, said: “The creative works we produce and consume are a reflection of our individual identities, local and national culture, and international trends. The BA (Hons) Creative Enterprise course will offer students a unique chance to explore these topics while also developing the entrepreneurial skills they need to become a success in a competitive creative industries sector. </p>
<p>“We are delighted to work in partnership with Queen Margaret University to offer this innovative new degree – I’m sure the programme will be the springboard to many exciting creative ventures in the future.” </p>
<p>Dr David Stevenson, Head of Media, Communication and Performing Arts at Queen Margaret University, said: “This new degree offers HND students a unique route to a degree level qualification while simultaneously developing their future as a creative freelancer. Fife College is the ideal hub in which students from a range of creative disciplines can inspire each other to turn their creative ideas into a career. </p>
<p>“Queen Margaret University is committed to ensuring that a career in the creative industries is something that is open to all. Innovative partnerships such as this help ensure that the widest range of young people in Scotland are able to gain the skills, knowledge and qualifications necessary to pursue a future in this dynamic and growing sector.” </p>
<p>Iain Hawker, Assistant Principal: Quality and Academic Partnerships at Fife College, said: “It is fantastic to see the hard work of the staff in both institutions come to fruition with the launch of this new degree. This degree and developing our partnership with Queen Margaret University is key for Fife College to grow the identified need that supports our widening access approach that not only meets the demands of our learners but also that of the Fife economy.”</p>]]></Value>

      <Value><![CDATA[Fife College has launched an innovative new undergraduate degree, which will help creative students turn their enterprising business dreams into reality. 

Developed in partnership with Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, the new BA (Hons) Creative Enterprise will equip students with the practical skills and expertise they need to transform their creative passion and talent into a sustainable freelance career. 

Drawing on the success of creative ‘hubs’ and ‘incubators’, the two-year multi-disciplinary programme will be open to those who have successfully completed an HND in a range of creative industries subjects, including Jewellery, Photography, Interior Design and Computer Animation. 

Students will continue to develop their creative practice under the guidance of a mentor while undertaking modules that explore finance, marketing, design thinking, project management, and social enterprise. 

The course, delivered at the College’s Glenrothes Campus, will be led by staff with international enterprising business experience in the creative industries. Their lived experience will ensure that all of the content is tailored towards the realities of working as a freelancer or running a small business within the creative industries. 

From day one students will be encouraged to start developing their business and each module has been designed to support them in creating a business model that will work. As such, in the final year students will also create a fully developed business plan rather than a dissertation for their honours project.
