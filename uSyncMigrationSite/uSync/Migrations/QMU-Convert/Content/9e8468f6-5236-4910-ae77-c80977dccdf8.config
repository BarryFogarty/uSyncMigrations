A dietitian influences food selection and eating behaviour of an individual based on specific nutritional or food requirements.</p>\n<p>As a dietitian, you will translate scientific information about nutrition into practical advice to help people make health-conscious decisions about food. You will assess, diagnose and treat diet-related problems and aim to raise awareness of the link between food, health and disease to prevent future problems and treat existing nutrition-related problems. Dietitians are a key part of the healthcare team and are the only nutrition professionals to be statutorily regulated.</p>\n<p>The course takes you through a clinically and practically focused study of disease, health, food and nutrition. With a clinical and health promotion focus, the course includes three practice-based placements that allow students to apply and consolidate their theoretical learning.</p>"

Learning activities include lectures, tutorials, workshops and practical classes and are guided using web-based supporting materials. You will also complete three practical placements to enable the integration of theoretical knowledge with practical experience.</p>\n<p>A variety of assessment methods are used across the course. A small cohort ensures that individuals receive excellent support and benefit from sharing their experiences with classmates.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>You will complete three periods of placement. Placements are randomly allocated as part of a Scottish-wide placement system. They can take place anywhere across Scotland.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by both our Master of Dietetics (MDiet) and MSc Dietetics (Pre-Registration) courses. Students have access to chemistry and microbiology laboratories for practical science based classes along with a fully equipped teaching kitchen and sensors suite for food based classed.  Practical rooms and a simulated ward environment are utilised for teaching and development of clinical skills. In addition students have access to appropriate equipment for completing nutritional assessments which is incorporated into teaching across all years of the programme. QMU also has an allotment/community garden and students can also access and become involved in the community garden activities</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module is equivalent to a notional 200 hours of work (or multiple thereof), which is made up of attendance in class, online learning and independent work. The structure of each module is different with different attendance requirements for each timetabled module. Over an average semester the expectation is that during 14 weeks of teaching students will undertake approximately 40 hours per week of student effort, including contact classes, online learning and independent study time. Students will normally complete the course via a full-time route.</p>\n<p>All placements are completed on a full-time basis and in line with the requirements of the dietetic service, normally Monday to Friday, 9am–5pm.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Normally there are 12-15 students enrolling on the course each year. Most of the classes are delivered with our undergraduate Master of Dietetics (MDiet) students.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
