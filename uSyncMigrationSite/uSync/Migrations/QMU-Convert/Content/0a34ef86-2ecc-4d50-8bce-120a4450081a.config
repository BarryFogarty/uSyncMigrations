Before coming to QMU, she gained a degree in Dance Studies from Knox College, Illinois, and spent time working with a dance company, a circus school and a repertory theatre. She added: "I'm still in denial that I'll be spending a month in Venice this summer- the Fellowship is such a unique opportunity, and the fact that it's been granted to both Bea and myself just doesn't feel real yet. I've started Italian lessons on a couple of apps and frequently grill friends who have travelled to or lived in Venice to start getting my head around it!"</p>
<p>Originally from London, Beatrix has a degree in Design for Exhibition and Museums, and also worked as an exhibition designer. She said: "This is a fantastic opportunity to travel, explore and be fully immersed in world-class contemporary art and architecture. I am incredibly grateful to our tutors and the British Council for selecting both of us to go forward on the trip. By carrying out a research project, I am hoping to build on my career aspirations, notably in exhibition management, as well as developing ideas for a permanent venue for queer art and history in Scotland."</p>
<p>Dr Anthony Schrag, Programme Leader for the MA Arts, Festivals and Cultural Management at QMU, said: "To participate in this project, we are required to put forward our two best candidates. The British Council then makes the final choice as to who should participate. It was difficult enough to create this shortlist, as we had such excellent submissions. When we whittled it down to Beatrix and Kyla, the whole team suggested that it was too-close-to-call which one the British Council would choose, as they both presented really strong applications.  They must have had the same difficulties in deciding as we did because they decided to take them both! I think this speaks to the amazing quality of our students, and we are very proud of them. We know they will make amazing contributions to the work and look forward to what they will achieve: it will be a great experience for them to put their skills into practice, as well as to enjoy this incredible festival in Venice. We're all a little jealous we can't go too!"</p>]]></Value>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Beatrix Moore and Kyla Tully - both students on QMU’s MA Arts, Festivals and Cultural Management degree programme - will travel to the north-eastern Italian city this summer. While there, they will work as invigilators at the British Pavilion exhibition and use their spare time to study, research, take in the local culture and reflect on the theme of this year’s festival – <em>How Will We Live Together?</em></p>
<p>The British Council Venice Fellowships are granted to around 70 people per year and support Fellows with a grant to cover their travel, living and accommodation costs in Venice for one month. Candidates are selected through a competitive application process, with successful applicants attending training in Coventry before embarking on their Venetian adventure.</p>
<p>Although QMU applicants have received this prestigious award in previous years, this is the first time that more than one student from the University has been granted with the Fellowship; this was made possible thanks in part to mobility funding from Santander Universities.</p>]]></Value>
