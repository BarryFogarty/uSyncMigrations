      <Value><![CDATA[<p>‘Enhancing Practice Conference 2016’ will provide nurse professionals and other healthcare staff with the opportunity to learn from some of the most influential nurse leaders and social leadership experts in Europe. The conference will share examples of best practice in healthcare and encourage participants to unearth the deeper levels of good practice development.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The event, which will take place at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, will run from 31 August until 2nd September with pre conference workshops taking place on 30 August.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">It is only the second time in 14 years that the event has been held in Scotland, and the University’s event organisers aim to present a world leading conference which has a Scottish twist.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Brendan McCormack, Head of the Division of Nursing and Professor Jan Dewing, Director of the Centre for Person-centred Practice Research at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, are hosting the conference. Professor McCormack explained: “We are very proud to be holding such a prestigious and dynamic healthcare conference at QMU, as this event is one which can help shape the future of our healthcare profession in the UK and internationally.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Dewing added: “The Enhancing Practice Conference 2016 will allow us to   explore the wisdom that is inherent in good practice development. By doing so, we can articulate the expertise needed to connect with person-centred cultures at an authentic level. In addition, it allows us to give voice to the creative engagement of practice developers in unearthing the deep layers of person-centred practice.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The conference is primarily aimed at nursing practitioners and leaders, but will also be attractive to those connected with healthcare who are involved in improving practice and its development.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Both Professor McCormack and Dewing  have 25 years specialist experience each  in the nursing of older people and are considered internationally-renowned authorities on person-centred nursing and practice development. In 2015, both were recognised as an ‘Inspirational Nursing Leader’ by The Nursing Times(UK nursing journal). Professor McCormack is a fellow of the Royal College of Nursing, was honoured in the Sigma Theta Tau International (STTI) 2014 International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame awards, and is listed in the Thomson Reuters 3000 most influential researchers globally. Professor Dewing is the editor for the International Journal of Practice Development, the on line journal of the International Practice Development Collaborative.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">As ide from being offered unprecedented networking opportunities and the opportunity to learn from international leaders in person-centred nursing, social change, community development, quality improvement and practice development,  delegates can expect a fun filled quirky event that pays tribute to its Scottish location. Clan gatherings, a film night, a ceilidh and the best of Scottish food will be woven throughout the three day learning event.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Enhancing Practice Conference 2016, ‘ Unearthing the Architecture of Practice Patterns: practice development and the co-construction of healthful workplaces’ will take place from 30 August (pre conference workshop) – 2nd September 2016 at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, Scotland. </p>]]></Value>
