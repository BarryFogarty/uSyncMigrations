You will thrive in our supportive environment, and benefit from placements each year along with practical experience in our specialist clinical facilities on campus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars, practical workshops and laboratories. Outside these timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through both directed and self-directed study. You will be assessed using a range of methods including practical exams and written course work at the end of each module or semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and practice educators. You will complete practice placements in each year.</p>\n<p>Placements take place within the NHS and social care sector at various locations across Scotland.</p>\n<p>QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student with the exception of the elective placement. The elective placement is organised by each individual student and provides the potential for a practice-based placement in a speciality area of interest or outside of the UK. It may be possible for you to undertake a single, elective, practice-based placement outside the UK.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employablity placements take place across across Scotland with students normally undertaking half their placements in NHS Lothian and the rest in other health boards across Scotland. For some health boards relocation for the duration of the placement might be required unless there are individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location. </p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/0d1f1e53125b43ae9c7ccad14e090565}\" title=\"Master of Physiotherapy (MPhys)\">Master of Physiotherapy (MPhys)/BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy</a> and <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/de974fae848b4bb0b56e4c9aa15381c0}\" title=\"MSc Physiotherapy (Pre-Registration)\">MSc Physiotherapy (Pre-Registration)</a> courses. Two large practical rooms are utilized for teaching and development of clinical skills. Students have access to numerous anatomy models which are incorporated into their learning during practical sessions and can be used during self-directed study sessions.  Our physiotherapy students also utilize QMU's clinical simulation suite which is equipped to practice both hands on skills and communication in a simulated real-life environment. The courses also have access to a motion analysis lab and human performance lab.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">This four-year undergraduate Master of Physiotherapy (MPhys)/BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy course will equip you with the expertise and practical skills that you need to work as a registered physiotherapist in the private or public health and social care sector. You will thrive in our supportive environment and benefit from placements in each year. </span></p>
<p>QMU offers two undergraduate pathways of study in Physiotherapy to achieve a recognised qualification. Initially all students register on the undergraduate master’s pathway and study together, then, from the end of the second year, students on the BSc (Hons) pathway follow a slightly different programme of study to those studying for the undergraduate master’s degree. On graduation, both pathways offer eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a physiotherapist.</p>
<p>Please see the course structure on this page for more information on the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/">benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>]]></Value>
