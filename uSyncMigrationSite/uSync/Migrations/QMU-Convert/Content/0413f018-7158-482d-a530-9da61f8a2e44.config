      "title": "Overview",
      "content": "<p>I obtained my PhD in theoretical phonology at the University of Edinburgh in 1991, having previously studied Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence. I undertook postdoctoral study at Stanford University, returning to Edinburgh and taking up a research post here at QMC (as it then was) under Professor Bill Hardcastle and Fiona Gibbon (who more recently has been professor at UCC, Ireland). This project introduced me to developmental clinical speech disorders, child language development, acoustic analysis, longitudinal methods and phonetic experimentation. It was quite a departure, and a foundation for what followed..</p>\n<p>Subsequently I worked on a variety of projects as research fellow and PI, bringing together these varied interests and experiences in my own research to address fine-grained systematic differences in accents, articulatory phonetics, acquisition, and connected speech. I also contributed to two of QMU’s strategic areas of research strength, namely the development and refinement of instrumental techniques for the study of speech, and their use for the assessment and remediation of speech disorders.</p>\n<p>I have also participated in a range of other areas of research importance for CASL, including child speech acquisition, psycholinguistics, bidialectalism and bilingualism, laboratory phonology, social variation.</p>\n<p>I was appointed to a QMU-funded post as senior research fellow in 2004, and professor in 2007. I have been Director of a research centre based around Speech and Hearing Science since 2009.</p>\n<p>I have pursued research interests through a range of projects, and with a number of collaborators. Long-standing relationships with Prof Alice Turk at Edinburgh and Prof Jane Stuart-Smith have led to ongoing joint supervisions of doctoral students as well as collaborative projects and opportunities for flexible post-doctoral funding. We also bid (also with Strathclyde) to host the International Congress of Phonetics Sciences in 2015. It is the world’s main phonetics conference, and it attracted nearly a thousand delegates to the SECC in Glasgow. In addition, long-standing collaborations with Prof Alan Wrench (Articulate Instruments Ltd) and Dr Joanne Cleland (Strathclyde) are responsible for helping develop ultrasound as a research and clinical tool. They have created the clinical protocols and instrumental tools used in QMU’s Articulatory Research Clinic.</p>\n<p>My own work has addressed such apparently esoteric topics such as the English consonants R and L, and the vowel OO, but this is because these sounds (1) require complex coordination of different parts of the tongue and the lips and varied tongue shapes, (2) show regional and social accent variation, (3) show covert articulatory social variation in Scottish English, and (4) are ideal as topics for research using ultrasound tongue imaging.</p>\n<p>For the university, I am a board member of the Scottish Graduate School of Social Sciences, sit on Senate, and participate on other institutional committees and working groups. In recent years I have led our research group in our research evaluations (RAE07, REF14), and am proud that CASL Research Centre was the core of so successful a submission to the Research Excellence Framework (2014) for the Modern Languages and Linguistics panel. Indeed, in terms of our overall profile in research and impact, 92% of our return was rated as internationally excellent or world leading (3* &amp; 4*), this measure placing us 2nd in the UK and first in Scotland.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Social Media:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qORqSA0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qORqSA0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research/Knowledge Exchange Centre Membership:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a data-id=\"1263\" href=\"/{localLink:1263}\" title=\"Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language Research Centre\">Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language Research Centre</a> (CASL) - Full</li>\n</ul>"

      "content": "<p>I am interested in the sounds of speech, in any of the world’s languages, and how our vocal tracts move to produce them. I use accent variation within a single language (English) as a tool to reveal how sounds and articulations vary in fine-grained yet systematic ways. I am also particularly interested how speech is acquired and mastered by children.</p>\n<p>Speech is an astonishingly complex phenomenon and takes years to learn; while articulation is very difficult to study scientifically. Tackling these two challenges, my research aims to help develop instrumental techniques which can be used to understand speech and its disorders, and to help resolve persistent childhood difficulties when used by Speech and Language Therapists as a real-time biofeedback tool.</p>\n<p>Using experiments and corpora, I look at how we combine sounds into words, how we then manage the sequence of words in speech, and how manage the transitions between speaking and silence.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Research Interests:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phonetics, articulation,</li>\n<li>phonology,</li>\n<li>speech science,</li>\n<li>speech acquisition,</li>\n<li>speech disorder,</li>\n<li>speech variation,</li>\n<li>talking heads,</li>\n<li>bidialectalism,</li>\n<li>conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research Methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ultrasound Tongue Imaging (UTI),</li>\n<li>Electropalatography (EPG),</li>\n<li>Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA),</li>\n<li>Acoustic analysis,</li>\n<li>clinical case study series.</li>\n</ul>"
