The five categories and prices are as shown below:</p>\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"259\" height=\"336\" style=\"width: 749px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"96\" style=\"width: 92px;\">Co2 Emission Figure</th>\n<th width=\"87\" style=\"width: 82px;\">Annual (Sept- May) £</th>\n<th width=\"76\" style=\"width: 83px;\">Single Semester (student) £</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 92px;\">Up to 100 g/km</td>\n<td style=\"width: 82px;\">51</td>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;\">28.50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 92px;\">100-120 g/km</td>\n<td style=\"width: 82px;\">60</td>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;\">33.50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 92px;\">121-150 g/km</td>\n<td style=\"width: 82px;\">92</td>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;\">51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 92px;\">151-165 g/km</td>\n<td style=\"width: 82px;\">140</td>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;\">78</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 92px;\">166-185 g/km</td>\n<td style=\"width: 82px;\">210</td>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;\">117</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 92px;\">Over 185 g/km</td>\n<td style=\"width: 82px;\">269</td>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;\">150</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>I live in the student accommodation on campus; can I get a permit?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Residents in the accommodation will not normally be granted a permit; if you have medical grounds or course-related requirements these may be taken into account in determining your eligibility for a permit.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>I have childcare commitments; does that guarantee me a permit?</strong></span></p>\n<p>There are a number of mitigating circumstances and exceptions that will be taken into consideration when a permit application is released. This is why we ask on certain permits for as much supporting information as possible to enable us to make an informed decision.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Why do I have to send my proof of address/vehicle V5?</span></p>\n<p>We use these items to support your application and ensure that you live where you say you live (you must use your term time address for your permit application) and that the CO2 emissions are what you have completed in the application form. We also require proof of any exemptions that you have informed us of to make sure we are assigning permits to those with the greatest need e.g. caring commitments.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>I can’t see the emissions data on my V5 or don’t have it, is there any way that I can find out the CO2 emissions of my vehicle?</strong></span></p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://vehicleenquiry.service.gov.uk/\" title=\"Government Vehicle Enquiry Service\">government website</a> that can assist you with regards to this.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Does a permit guarantee me a space?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A permit does not guarantee you a space. We assign permits to an agreed limit which should ensure availability of spaces based on patterns of use and frequency which staff and students attend the campus. A permit means you are entitled to park in the car park. There may be times when the car park is at full capacity and you will have to wait for an available space or seek alternative parking at your own expense. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What should I do if I cannot get a permit?</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you do not get a permit, there are a number of other travel options available. They can all be found on the <a data-id=\"6255\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a713799de0204325bb063efbd482f213}\" title=\"Location and Getting Here\">getting here</a> section of the website. Limited day permits may be available at a cost of £5 via the PayByPhone app, as detailed in the Daily Parking section of this webpage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>I bring a motorcycle to work, do I need a permit?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Owners of motorcycles are not required to register or display a permit unless they opt to park in a full parking space.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Where else can i park if not on campus?</span></p>\n<p>As an alternative to parking on campus, please consider the use of the local Park and Ride facilities at Newcraighall and Wallyford which are all connected by direct bus services to QMU.</p>\n<p>Parking at Wallyford Park &amp; Ride is free and can be accessed via a 4 minute train journey. </p>\n<p><em>If these frequently asked questions have not helped with your query, please contact <a href=\"mailto:parking@qmu.ac.uk\">parking@qmu.ac.uk</a>.</em></p>"
