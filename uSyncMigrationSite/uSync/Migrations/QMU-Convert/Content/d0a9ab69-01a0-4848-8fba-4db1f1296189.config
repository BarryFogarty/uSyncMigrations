      "content": "<p>On this course, you will develop a strong theoretical understanding of speech and language therapy (SLT) through modules in linguistics, psychology, biological and medical sciences, and research methods. Regular clinical placements will build your practical skills.</p>\n<p>Year One will provide a grounding in development across the lifespan in the areas of physical sciences, linguistics and psychology. To facilitate your transition into university there will be a focus on academic writing and how to access appropriate information. You will develop knowledge and apply it at observational placements in local early years settings, primary schools and with older people, usually in a social care setting.</p>\n<p>Year Two focuses predominantly on childhood and developmental speech, language and communication disorders. You will continue to build your knowledge in physical sciences, linguistics, psychology and research methods with increased application to clinical areas. You will develop your clinical skills through weekly placements in local clinics in Semester One.</p>\n<p>Year Three will provide an opportunity to develop research and critical thinking skills. You will enhance your clinical decision making skills (assessment/goal setting/management planning/outcome evaluation) through case studies and in-class discussions. You will focus on disorders of communication acquired in adulthood and related to sensory, cognitive and physical impairments. You will explore different areas of practice through clinical masterclasses. You will continue to link theory to practice as you attend clinical placements during the semesters and a block placement during the summer.</p>\n<p>Year Four will provide the opportunity to enhance, consolidate and reflect on your learning to date. You will continue to develop your skills in research, professional development, and current and advanced clinical skills enabling a smooth transition to working life. You will explore leadership skills and gain an understanding of key skills for collaboration and training. You will complete your academic learning by undertaking a focused research dissertation. This year includes 20 days of clinical placement. You’ll continue to attend clinical placement during the semester.</p>\n<p>We aim for all of our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow them to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member. This is the reason why we have implemented an interprofessional focus within all of our healthcare courses, including this one.</p>\n<p> </p>"

It should be noted that in most parts of the UK it is not possible to arrange direct observation or work-shadowing within Speech and Language Therapy clinics; however, many areas arrange introductory sessions for potential students. In addition, many charities working with and for people with communication needs welcome volunteers who are willing to support people with communication difficulties. </p>\n<p>Other requirements:</p>\n<p><strong>PVG check</strong></p>\n<p>All offers of places are conditional on receipt of a satisfactory check through the Protecting Vulnerable Groups Scheme (or equivalent). All prospective students who are offered a place should be aware that acceptance onto the programme cannot be taken as a guarantee that the applicant satisfies the requirements for registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as a Speech and Language Therapist</p>\n<p><strong>Health clearance </strong></p>\n<p>All applicants are expected to be free of any health problems which could affect their ability to practice safely and effectively.

The document ‘Guidance on Health and Character’ (HCPC, 2017) provides some general information which may be useful. </p>\n<p><strong>Additional Costs </strong></p>\n<p>All students are responsible for their own expenses incurred on clinical placement such as; pre-placement checks; travel costs; and accommodation (summer).  Students are required to pay for their PVG<strong> </strong>application (approximately £60) and may have additional costs for vaccines and blood tests (up to approximately £90, normally)<strong>,</strong> depending on their medical history.   </p>\n<p>In addition, students from England, Wales, Northern Ireland and International students will also be liable for additional fees to cover the cost of health clearance, badges and uniforms. The current cost is around £95.</p>\n<p>Students are also required to have indemnity insurance in place before attending placement, this is most cost effectively obtained by joining the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.rcslt.org/help-and-support/membership-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)</a> as a student member.  </p>\n<p>Students are advised to check with the relevant student funding agencies if there is a way of reclaiming the travel and accommodation expenses incurred on placement.  <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.saas.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Students from Scotland may be eligible for funding from SAAS</a> depending on their circumstances. </p>"
