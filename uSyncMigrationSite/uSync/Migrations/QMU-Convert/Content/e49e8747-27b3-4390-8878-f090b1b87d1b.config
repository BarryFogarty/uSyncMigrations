      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This Policy applies to any present or potential student or staff member who has additional needs arising from a disability. This Policy also extends to members of the public using the University’s premises. For the purposes of this Policy, disability is understood to cover specific learning difficulties and physical or mental impairments. The University gives cognisance to the definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010:-</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>A person is considered disabled where they have a physical or mental impairment that has a ‘substantial’ and ‘long-term’ negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities. In this regard, substantial means more than trivial and long term means twelve months or more.</strong></p>
<p>QMU supports a mainstreaming approach to disability, often referred to as the ‘social model of disability’. This model recognises that the disadvantages and social exclusion experienced by many disabled people are not the inevitable result of their impairments or medical conditions, but rather stem from attitudinal and environmental barriers which discriminate against disabled people and limit their life chances.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The aims of this Policy are to ensure that:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>All staff and students engage in developing an inclusive environment within the University.</li>
<li>Information about disability provision at the University is accessible to all applicants, students, staff, and the public.</li>
<li>Application for admission to the University is assessed on the basis of the applicant’s academic aptitudes, abilities and qualifications.</li>
<li>Learning, teaching and assessment strategies are employed so that curricula is as inclusive as reasonably possible.</li>
<li>The needs of disabled students and staff, as identified through consultation, are included in the process of strategic planning and resource allocation.</li>
<li>Disabled students and staff have access to appropriate support and the University seeks, where possible, to make reasonable adjustments that enable them to participate as fully as possible in the life of the University.</li>
<li>The views of individual students and members of staff are taken into account at all times when their requirements are being assessed.</li>
<li>Members of staff working with disabled students or colleagues with a disability have appropriate information and support.</li>
<li>Disabled staff have equal access to staff development opportunities.</li>
<li>Disabled members of the public can participate in public events held on University premises.</li>
<li>As far as is reasonably practicable and within the constraints of existing buildings and available resources the University premises are accessible and safe for disabled people.</li>
<li>Information relating to disabled students and staff is held in a confidential manner consistent with the University Data Protection Policy and Guidelines.</li>

<p>The Equality Scheme for the University, together with the Equality Scheme Action Plan, is designed to comply with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>The Equality Act was passed into law in 2010, with the majority its provisions coming into effect on 1st April 2011. It was introduced to provide a cross-cutting equality legislative framework to protect the rights of individuals and advance equality of opportunity for all. It aims to update, simplify and strengthen previous legislation and deliver a framework of discrimination law that promotes a fair and more equal society. The Act combined the three existing equality duties (race, gender and disability) and strengthened protection against discrimination in the areas of sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, pregnancy and maternity and gender reassignment.</p>
<p>As was the case with the legislation it replaced, the Act has two parts; namely the General Duty and Specific Duties.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The General Duty remains largely as before, and can be summarised as requiring public authorities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>eliminate unlawful discrimination;</li>
<li>advance equality of opportunity; and</li>
<li>foster good relations across protected characteristics.</li>
<li>As part of this General Duty, and in relation to disability, the University will:
<ul>
<li>promote equality of opportunity for all;</li>
<li>eliminate discrimination that is unlawful and eliminate disability related harassment;</li>
<li>promote positive attitudes towards disabled people;</li>
<li>encourage participation by disabled people in public life; and</li>
<li>take steps to meet disabled people’s needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The development of the Equality Scheme and the Equality Action Plan is coordinated by the Equality and Diversity Committee (see below).

<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The implementation of this Policy is the responsibility of the University and all staff, students and the public, where applicable. All staff and students have a personal responsibility to adhere to and apply this Policy in their dealings with others, both internal and external to the University.</p>
<p>The University expects all staff and students to be aware of this Policy and the related legislation, and to treat disabled people, whether students, staff or members of the public, fairly, with respect and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p>This Policy is ultimately the responsibility of the University Court and the Senate, led by the Principal.</p>

<p>Deans of School and Heads of Support Departments are representatives of the University Court in ensuring that disabled students and staff are not treated less favourably in comparison to others in the University.</p>
<p>Deans of School are responsible for the final determination of Individual Learning Plans (ILPs) for disabled students and for facilitating reasonable adjustments for students within the Schools, in consultation with other responsible individuals in the relevant departments. Acting on advice received from subject area, Academic Disabled Student Co-ordinators and the Disability Service, Deans of School will be responsible for ensuring that the strategies incorporated within individual ILPs are acted upon by module coordinators.</p>

<p><strong>4 General Principles</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The University believes that a properly implemented and monitored policy on disability is in the best interests of its students and staff. The University will encourage students, the Students’ Union and all academic and administrative departments to produce ideas and plans for improving access, support and services for students and staff with disabilities, both in the short term and in the long term. The University will provide information and training to increase awareness among staff and students of this Policy and of disability issues and requirements.</p>

<p><strong>5 Students and applicants</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>5.1 General</strong></p>
<p>The University will agree procedures and practices to ensure that disabled students are treated fairly. It will make reasonable adjustments to support students in their learning environment and, so far as is reasonable, remove or reduce barriers which prevent disabled students from successful participation in all aspects of University life.</p>
<p>Potential students will be given sufficient information about the University and academic programmes to enable them to make an informed decision about whether they could undertake a programme of study at QMU. This should include clear information about programme outcomes, learning and teaching approaches, assessment, professional requirements and student support. Potential students with a disability are advised to visit the Scottish Government links below. These give information on helping disabled students meet the costs of learning and support: <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/guide-to-learner-funding-2017-to-2018/" title="Scottish Government cost of learning">Scots gov - cost of learning </a></p>

<p><strong>5.2 Student Admissions</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The criteria for admission to particular courses of study will be made explicit to all applicants. The University will ensure that such criteria do not create unnecessary barriers to disabled applicants. Each subject areas has a designated member of staff as their Academic Disabled Student Coordinator (ADSC) with whom disabled students may discuss course curricula, and the teaching and learning activities, to ensure that any learning support and other needs are clearly identified. Course descriptions will include information on the ADSCs.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>5.3 Disclosure</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Disabled students are strongly encouraged to inform the University of any disability they may have, and to discuss their requirements with a member of the Disability Service staff as early as possible. If a student discloses a disability to any other member of the University’s staff, the University is deemed to know of that student’s disability. However, unless the student then contacts the Disability Service to discuss their needs, the University may not be able to put in place all of the required support. If the student is a Scottish, English, Welsh or Irish student, neither the student nor the University will be able to access any relevant funding to procure the necessary support workers or equipment, unless the Disability Service is involved and DSA application is made.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>To secure the best possible support, a disabled student, regardless of their country of origin, must work with the Disability Service and their Academic Disabled Student Coordinator (ADSC) for their subject to set in place the relevant reasonable adjustments and an Individual Learning Plan tailored to their needs.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>It is <strong>the student’s responsibility</strong> to disclose their disability and to discuss, agree and take up the support offered by the University, including, if appropriate, applying for the Disabled Students Allowance (DSA) or its equivalent.</p>
<p>It is <strong>the University’s responsibility,</strong> once the student has disclosed, to ensure that both the Disability Service and the ADSC work with the student, to put in place relevant reasonable adjustments and an Individual Learning Plan.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>5.4 Curriculum</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Teachability: Creating an Accessible Curriculum for Students with Disabilities (SHEFC, 2000) has been adopted by the University and is used to scrutinise programmes in respect of equality and disability.</p>
<p>The University endeavours to ensure that courses (including placements and other specialist learning environments) are organised and delivered in ways that offer the best possible opportunities for full participation by all students, including disabled students. A student who has disclosed a disability will be provided with an Individual Learning Plan (ILP), which guides Programme Teams in making any necessary teaching and/or assessment arrangements. This mechanism should also be used to enable disabled students to discuss any emerging needs and identify appropriate courses of action to address those needs.</p>
<p>A reasonable adjustment would be any action that helps to alleviate a substantial disadvantage. It might for example involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing institutional procedures, such as the recruitment and selection process or adapting the curriculum, while maintaining standards;</li>
<li>providing additional support, such as a proofreader (see Appendix 1), a scribe, or a sign language interpreter;</li>
<li>training staff to work with disabled people and to provide appropriate adjustments;</li>
<li>altering the physical environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.5 Support for disabled students on practice/work placements: Information for students and placement providers</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The University regards the accessibility of its curriculum for all students as a crucial aspect of academic quality. For this reason the University has assigned responsibility for promoting and monitoring curriculum accessibility to its key committees. (see section 3: Implementation and Responsibilities)</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Individual Learning Plans (ILPs)<br />All support given to students following disclosure of a disability is recommended at a needs/ entitlement assessment carried out by the Needs Assessment Centres, either within or external to the University and its Disability Service. This is a prerequisite to receiving any additional support or allowance. If a student has disclosed a disability, his/her individual support needs should be addressed in the Individual Learning Plan which should be put in place as soon as possible and in any case prior to attending a placement. The Individual Learning Plan will detail the fullest reasonable adjustments that may be accommodated by the Programme Team, on consultation with the Academic Disabled Student Coordinator for that area. All reasonable adjustments must be practicable in the learning environment applicable to the programme.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>It is good practice to have discussions about the student’s Individual Learning Plan with the higher education institution, placement provider and student prior to any placement commencing. A pre placement visit is recommended to discuss the student’s support needs and the reasonable adjustments required. Reasonable adjustments for the placement will be context dependent and should support the achievement of professional competencies (as may be set out by the relevant regulating body). Students should be informed of changes to their ILP that may be required in the placement environment. Students should be encouraged to develop strategies throughout their period of registration that will assist them to meet these competencies on completion of their programme and to help them gain employment in their chosen field.</p>
<p>In relation to placements, the reasonable adjustments recommended will depend on the placement provider’s ability to implement such adjustments, having regard to the student’s needs and the provider’s duty of care to the public.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><strong>5.6 Examinations and Assessment</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Appropriate modes of examination and assessment will be determined, after consultation with the student and relevant staff and the provision of relevant evidence, to enable students to demonstrate that they have met the criteria for progression or the conferment of an award. The purpose of any special arrangement is to compensate for any restriction imposed by the disability without compromising academic standards.</p>
<p>For clarity, it is emphasised that no compensation will be applied to standards of assessment, only to the arrangements for the method of assessment. Any request for special arrangements, outside those that have already been agreed, in relation to examination and assessment procedures must be supported by medical or other evidence and it is the student’s responsibility to make that available to the University.</p>

<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">

<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Potential students are strongly advised to contact the Disability Service as early as possible to discuss their requirements. Doing this at the application stage, or before, allows both the student and the University to agree, at the earliest opportunity, what support would be needed in order for them to study at QMU and whether the facilities and services available would meet their needs.</p>
<p>Given the legislation and our commitment to offering academic opportunity to all suitably qualified applicants, whenever possible, and irrespective of disability, there are only a few instances in which a disabled applicant who meets the entry criteria may be rejected:</p>
<ul>
<li>When overriding health and safety hazards cannot be overcome</li>
<li>When barriers caused by professional requirements and/or by regulations of professional bodies preclude membership by people with specific disabilities. In these circumstances, a Fitness to Practise Panel may be required to determine whether a student may be admitted to the programme. Being admitted to a programme which is regulated does not guarantee access to the chosen profession.</li>
<li>When essential reasonable adjustments cannot be made to the course content and the course’s structure of delivery or to the provision of suitable staff or facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>No academically qualified applicant who has, where required, satisfied an admissions interview panel or selector of their suitability in terms of motivation and commitment to the field of study will be refused a place on disability-related grounds before an opportunity has been given for full consideration of the specific support or facilities required, in consultation with the University's Disability Service.</p>
<p>If a suitably qualified disabled applicant is rejected solely on grounds of their disability, a record of the decision and the reasons for it will be kept. To facilitate an alternative choice of course and/or institution, the University will provide feedback to the applicant, UCAS or other relevant body.</p>

<p><strong>5.8 Students who become disabled during their studies</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The University will take all appropriate steps to ensure that a student who becomes disabled during the course of their studies has every opportunity to complete their course. This will be achieved through the provision of the same level of adaptations and support as a comparable student who was disabled at the start of their course and/or through flexible interpretation of degree regulations, within the constraints of maintaining due academic standards. As above, Fitness to Practise considerations may also need to be taken into account.</p>

<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The University aims to provide an environment which is supportive and fair. If any probelm relating to the operation of this policy occurs, students and staff are encouraged to advise an appropriate member of staff as soon as possible. Where a complaint is not dealt with satisfactorily at an informal level, any formal complaint should, in the case of a student, be pursued through the <a href="/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/complaint-handling/" title="QMU Complaints Procedure">Complaints Procedure</a>.</p>
<p>For staff a complaint or grievance should be pursued through the appropriate grievance procedure or Dignity at Work Policy. Both the Grievance Policy and the Dignity at Work Policy can be found on the intranet in the Human Resources site under <a href="/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/" title="QMU Policies and Procedures">Policies and Procedures</a></p>
