      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Bernadette Syme, from Tullibody in Clackmannanshire near Stirling, came to Queen Margaret University (QMU) as a direct entrant from college, having completed an HND which allowed her to enter into second year of QMU’s BA (Hons) International Hospitality and Tourism Management course.</p>
<p>After suffering a brain haemorrhage in 2005, Bernadette endured a further six aneurysms in her brain with stents placed to treat them. Aspects of her learning have been impacted as a result, but with excellent support from the University’s support services and access to equipment and software to aid her education, Bernadette has excelled herself and graduated from QMU on Tuesday 9 July with first class honours.</p>
<p>“The University is really good at helping people,” said Bernadette, “especially with my disabilities. They’ve been there and helped me get where I am today which I am so, so grateful for.”</p>
<p>While at QMU, Bernadette benefited from the Apex Hotel Shooting Starts Scholarship which gives hands-on experience of every aspect of the hotel’s business. “The Apex Scholarship provided me with the opportunity to learn how a hotel works from the inside, and how all the different departments come together as one,” she said. “That was a fantastic experience to learn all of that.”</p>
<p>Bernadette was also awarded the Lord Forte Foundation Scholarship which carries with it a financial award of £2,500 to support her during her final year of study at QMU. She said: “Up until fourth year, I was working while I was studying but thanks to the Lord Forte Scholarship, I had peace of mind having the financial aid behind us. That helped me to get such a high mark in my dissertation because I could focus solely on my education rather than working, so it was a real honour.” The high mark in her dissertation helped Bernadette secure the Dakota Award for Innovation in Hospitality Dissertation.</p>
<p>In return for all the wonderful support and experiences she’s had at QMU, Bernadette has gone out of her way to give back to the institution. As a Peer Assisted Learning leader, Bernadette has offered support to other students who’ve come to the University via similar educational pathways. She has also served as a Direct Entrant Facilitator, speaking to prospective direct entrant students to answer questions and offer reassurance.</p>
<p>“The best thing about Queen Margaret University is how everyone comes together to help each other,” she said. “Both lecturers and students come together as a team and we help each other, so that nobody struggles.”</p>
<p>This is not the end of Bernadette’s journey with QMU; she will be staying on to undertake a master’s in International Management and Leadership later this year.</p>
