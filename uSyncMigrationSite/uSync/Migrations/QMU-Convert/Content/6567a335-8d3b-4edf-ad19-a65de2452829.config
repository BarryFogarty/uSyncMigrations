      <Value><![CDATA[<p>It is the first time that Queen Margaret University (QMU) has applied to the government accredited award scheme which recognises excellence in customer service delivery. The award specifically acknowledged the high standard of service offered by QMU’s Library Services, Accommodation Services, Conference &amp; Events and Sports &amp; Leisure Services.</p>
<p>The Customer Service Excellence Standard focuses on organisations which deliver customer services which are efficient, effective and which empower the consumer. Particularly, it values organisations which always place customers at the heart of the service provision. The gruelling exercise looks at five key service areas and emphasises the development of customer insight, understanding the user’s experience and robust measurement of service satisfaction. The Campus Services team is particularly pleased that it achieved the highest rating possible in the area of ‘customer focus’ (compliance plus) which reflects the culture of the university.</p>
<p>Steve Scott, Director of Campus and Commercial Services at QMU, said it was the significant team effort which resulted in this success. “It was a massive undertaking as it took 15 months of hard work to prepare for the final submission. There were five key areas - delivery, timelines, information, professionalism and staff attitudes – and each department had to respond to 57 elements within these areas. The departments which took part were scrutinised for 12 months in the lead up to the award and the exercise has involved several visits by trained assessors who analysed a full range of service delivery elements.”</p>
<p>The accreditation lasts for three years with the university being assessed each year.</p>
<p>The assessor made some very positive comments in his report, including: “There was a very clear culture led from the top, and through the commitment of managers, to customer focused service delivery, whilst at the same time recognising the value of feedback from staff about how services could be developed and improved.”</p>
<p>The assessor also recognised QMU’s strength in having a robust complaints process across all services.</p>
<p>Steve concluded: “We are delighted that the hard work of the Campus Services team has paid off and our success confirms our aim of putting the student experience at the heart of the university and developing efficient professional services for the wider QMU community.”</p>]]></Value>
