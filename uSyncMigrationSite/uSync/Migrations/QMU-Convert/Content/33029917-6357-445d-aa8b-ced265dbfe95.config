      <Value><![CDATA[<p>QMU has offered their Nursing and Allied Health Professions students on the frontline a choice of one of two luxury food hampers – a 'pamper hamper' or breakfast hamper - to thank them for their hard work in battling the pandemic. The gifts have been provided by Artisan Larder Scotland, founded by QMU graduate David McVey.</p>
<p>Edinburgh Napier has linked up with Edinburgh-based sushi company Minato Sushi to offer its own eligible School of Health and Social Care students a £35 voucher for the business as a thank you for their efforts as part of the country's COVID-19 response. Minato Sushi was founded by Jennifer Kerr and Tom Ruddy – both Edinburgh Napier alumni. The local business continues to receive support from the University's innovation and enterprise hub, Bright Red Triangle.</p>
<p>Matt Hutnell, Director, Santander Universities, said: "Universities across the UK, such as Queen Margaret University and Edinburgh Napier University, are doing some fantastic work to contribute to the UK's effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, so we're delighted to continue to support both students and local communities during this critical time."</p>
<p>Sir Paul Grice, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Queen Margaret University, said: "We are incredibly proud of all of our students from the School of Health Sciences, especially those who are playing their part in the NHS's fight against COVID-19. Thanks to the continuing generosity and support of Santander Universities, we have been able to not only provide this thank you gift for hundreds of our hard-working health students, but also support one of our graduate businesses in the process. I hope the students enjoy the gift – they are doing fantastic work!"</p>
<p>Professor Andrea Nolan, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University, said: "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our nursing and midwifery students have demonstrated outstanding levels of professionalism during what has been an incredibly challenging – and often uncertain – time for all.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the generous continued support from Santander Universities, we're delighted to be able to show our gratitude to nearly 900 students with this token of appreciation. I am pleased to be able to support one of our alumni businesses in the process. Our nursing and midwifery students have proved themselves to be wonderful ambassadors for the University and the health professions; on behalf of the whole university community, I thank them most sincerely."</p>]]></Value>
