Curriculum for Excellence includes film as part of literacy, but there are few significant opportunities to develop the professional practice of film education, or to qualify and specialise in it.

<p><span class="lead">Want to use film in the classroom, but unsure where to begin? Looking to put your filmmaking skills to use in educational settings, but don’t know where to start?</span></p>
<p>Funded by Screen Scotland, and aligning with their development of a Film and Screen Curriculum for Scottish schools, this Introduction to Film Education course will help you to answer those questions. Film, and the moving image more broadly, are central to the lives of young people, and this course develops the knowledge and practical skills of participants to be able to embed film in their practice and reflect on the ways film can be embedded within Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence.</p>
<p>This short course is the first course of three which, on successful completion of all three, will enable you to attain a <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/20734d3d2c4a497cb6cfd00b1e62175b}" title="PgCert Film and Screen Education">PgCert Film and Screen Education</a>.
