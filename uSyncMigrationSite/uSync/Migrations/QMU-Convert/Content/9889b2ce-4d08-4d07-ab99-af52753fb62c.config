      "content": "<p>The hospitality, tourism and events sector has experienced significant growth in recent decades, emerging as a significant contributor to both the Scottish and global economy, accounting for 1 in 10 jobs worldwide and supporting a substantial number of enterprises. The events sector in particular has undergone remarkable expansion over the last 20 years, encompassing everything from pop-up food fairs to high profile corporate events, trade shows and our own world-famous Edinburgh festivals. While hospitality, tourism and events can be viewed as separate industries in some ways, they are also deeply interlinked in others, and throughout your course you will deepen your understanding of this through experiential learning, enabling you to put theory into practice. This involves the creative planning, delivery, and execution of live events, participating in a group walking tour, leading live business consultancy among other activities. Moreover, your 20-week paid industry internship will equip you with real-life experience that is sure to boost your employability.</p>\n<p>Our location in Edinburgh is sure to enrich your learning experience: Known as “the festival city” and one of the world’s top tourist destinations, you have an abundance of hospitality and events venues right at your doorstep, which provide numerous opportunities for internships, field trips to distilleries and a wide range of other attractions, as well as part-time work and graduate career opportunities. You will also benefit from guest lectures from some of Scotland’s major tourism, hospitality, and events players.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gain a thorough theoretical understanding of the political, economic and social factors at work in the industry, and what they will mean for you as a manager of the future;</li>\n<li>learn hands-on how to manage money, resources and talent in the fast-moving hospitality, tourism and events environment;</li>\n<li>plan and deliver live events;</li>\n<li>go on a 20-week paid internship that will boost your employability; and</li>\n<li>acquire the skills to work in exciting and vibrant sectors of increasing importance and relevance to a modern and socially just society.</li>\n</ul>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>All students enrol onto the honours degree, but you can choose to exit with an ordinary degree after three years.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars and practical workshops. You will engage in practical, hands-on experience at every level of your studies. Outside these timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of methods during each semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement (Internship)</strong></p>\n<p>You will complete a 20-week internship in Year Two, in the UK or overseas. Academic staff will help you prepare for this invaluable real-world experience, and we will set up interviews on campus to make finding the perfect host organisation as straightforward as possible.</p>\n<p>In the past, our students have undertaken internships in a diverse range of roles and with a multitude of businesses. Examples include acting as front of house at the Balmoral Hotel's One restaurant, contributing to the events departments of the Renaissance private member's golf club in Archerfield, adopting the role of an events planner for the tourism, events, and cultural department of the city of Vannes in France, and engaging in various responsibilities within HR departments across the UK, Europe, and the USA. These internships can be transformative experiences for our students, as exemplified in these testimonials:</p>\n<p><em> “I'm very grateful for this experience, I have learnt so much, met some amazing people and gained connections within the industry I want to work in, which opens up a lot of opportunities for me for the future.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I'm very happy with my internship and what I've learned and I'm still in contact with them. It also confirmed my career choice and that I'd really like to work in events/tourism and marketing.”</em></p>\n<p>Several bursaries and scholarships are available to help with costs, such as the Moffat Trust, the Santander Universities Mobility Fund, the Vice-Chancellor’s &amp; Student Development Fund or the Susan Smith IHTEM Student Development Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>Studying abroad through our exchange programme can be one of the most exciting and rewarding challenges for a student to experience. The opportunity to travel and live in another country, learn different customs and traditions, meet new people and future career draws many students into the exchange programme. In Year Three, you will have the opportunity to study overseas (subject to availability) for one semester.
