<p>TABLE</p>
<p>7.3    A student’s overall performance on a postgraduate module will be given marks within one of eight grades as follows:</p>
<p>TABLE</p>
<p>7.4    These grades should be used in a consistent fashion at all levels of assessment whether it is judging a student’s overall performance; a cohort’s performance, a module grade, or a piece of assessed coursework.</p>
<p>7.5    The criteria for each of the grades above are listed in the Appendices.</p>
<p>7.6    Normally subjects will be assessed using marks and grades. However, in exceptional circumstances subjects may be assessed using grades only. This will be recorded in programme specific regulations.</p>
<p>7.7  If an undergraduate subject is assessed using a grade only, then the following grade-to-mark conversion scheme shall be used for the purposes of computation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A* - 85%</li>
<li>A - 75%</li>
<li>B - 65%</li>
<li>C - 55%</li>
<li>D - 45%</li>
<li>E - 35%</li>
<li>F - 15%</li>
</ul>
<p>7.8   If a postgraduate subject is assessed using a grade only, then the following grade-to-mark conversion scheme shall be used for the purpose of computation. </p>
<ul style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">
<li>A* - 85%</li>
<li>A - 75%</li>
<li>B - 65%</li>
<li>C - 55%</li>
<li>D - 45%</li>
<li>E - 20%</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, the mark is set at the midpoint of the band. However, the mark at Grade A* is limited to 85 to reflect the comparatively few marks likely to be awarded over 90%.</p>]]></Value>

Weighted aggregate scores will be rounded to one decimal place. The classification will be based upon the average mark obtained by combining the weighted results of all modules studied at SCQF levels 9 and 10. Any modules undertaken below SCQF level 9 and any modules taken whilst on an exchange arrangement will not be counted towards the Honours calculation.</p>\n<p>Where a student has accumulated more than 120 credits at SCQF level 10, a maximum of 120 credits will be counted at SCQF level 10 for the purpose of the Honours calculation. All core modules at SCQF level 10 will count towards the Honours classification. The optional modules in which the student achieved the highest marks will be included in the calculation of the Honours classification.

Any modules undertaken below SCQF level 9 and any modules taken whilst on an exchange arrangement will not be counted towards the distinction calculation.</p>\n<p>8.4    The award of taught Masters Degrees and Postgraduate Diplomas may include an award with distinction or merit. The award of Postgraduate Certificate is without distinction or merit.</p>\n<p>A distinction is granted automatically if the weighted average mark (each module being weighted in relation to its size) - is 70% or over.</p>\n<p>A merit is granted automatically if the weighted average mark (each module being weighted in relation to its size) - is 60% or over.</p>\n<p>Only modules undertaken at SCQF level 11 will be used in the calculation for distinction or merit.</p>\n<p>8.5    When granted an award a student will automatically be de-registered and must reapply if they wish to proceed to a higher or different award.</p>\n<p>8.6    Where a student is admitted to the University at level four the classification will be based entirely on grades achieved during level four studies.</p>\n<p>8.7    Where a student is admitted to a level and given additional credit at that level gained externally, the grades from that credit may contribute to the classification where the credit is at the appropriate SCQF level and where marks are available.
