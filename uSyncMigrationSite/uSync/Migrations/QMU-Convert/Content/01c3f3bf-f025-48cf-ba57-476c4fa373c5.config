<p>Our QMU Action Plan focuses on improving access, removing barriers, improving experience, and removing obstacles through addressing the following nine key National themes:</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li><strong>Across all our services – Public Services</strong><br />(Ensuring information and services are accessible to BSL users)</li>

<li><strong>School Education </strong>(Reaching full potential through continual support)</li>
<li><strong>Post-School Education </strong>(Receive the support BSL users need to do well)</li>
<li><strong>Training, Work and Social Security </strong>(Skills development to reach potential and improve progression)</li>

<div class="column">
<p>This is the BSL Plan for Queen Margaret University (QMU), as required by the BSL (Scotland) Act. It sets out actions we will take over the period 2018-2024. It follows the BSL National Plan, published on 24 October 2017, which was developed through extensive engagement with Deaf and Deafblind BSL users and those who work with them. It is framed around the same long-term goals as the national plan, where these are relevant to the work of this organisation.</p>
<p>At QMU, we are highly committed to protecting and promoting BSL. In our organisational structure, we have the HR department and the Disability Service that work towards ensuring that BSL users<em>[1]</em> at QMU are properly supported.</p>
<p>We have experience of supporting BSL users as students and occasional staff on programmes within QMU and ensuring they are fully supported during their studies. We are committed to building on this.</p>
<p>QMU has already established an MSc programme for registered BSL/English interpreters, which is a unique provision to upskill interpreters in specialist fields of work. The strategic importance of this has been recognised by the Scottish Government through the ‘Promoting Equality and Cohesion Fund’ as it aligns directly with actions 8, 47 and 62 from the BSL National Plan. However, the programme indirectly promotes many of the other actions within the plan.</p>
<p>QMU is also developing further opportunities for BSL awareness-raising at undergraduate and postgraduate levels through the employment of a part-time lecturer who is a BSL user. These developments will help embed an understanding of the issues affecting BSL users.</p>
<p>We are committed to an action plan, which is ambitious, responsive, builds on our progress and which is continually shaped by national initiatives, local needs and the priorities of BSL users. Our actions will be embedded into our Inclusive Learning and Teaching Materials Policy and feedback sought continually from students and staff through informal and formal mechanisms, including staff development and workshop sessions.</p>
<p>QMU will commit to contributing to the National Progress Report in 2020 through submission of data analytics and information requests as required to enable us to build on our progress and take us closer to the national long-term goals.</p>
