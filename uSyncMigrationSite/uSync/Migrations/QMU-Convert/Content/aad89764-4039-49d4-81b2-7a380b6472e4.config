<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>
<p>In Level 1, the student undertakes a formative, introductory two week clinical placement to begin the process of practice education.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>
<p>In Level 2, the student undertakes two modules: “Introduction to Clinical Practice in Diagnostic Imaging” (ICP) and “Clinical Practice in Diagnostic Imaging 2” (CP2). The student must pass the clinical component of ICP before progressing to CP2. ICP, the student undertakes 5 weeks of clinical placement. The learner commences the process of acquiring general radiographic expertise, the safe, effective integration process and starts to develop a profile of professional identity. CP2, the student undertakes 7 weeks of clinical placement. The learner continues to build on the knowledge and skills attained, during Introduction to Clinical Practice, ensuring there is close integration of theory and practice.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Level 3</strong></p>
<p>In Level 3, the student undertakes one module: “Clinical Practice in Diagnostic Imaging 3” (CP3) including 12 weeks of clinical placement. The learner thereby continues the safe, effective and efficient integration into the multidisciplinary health care team whilst continuing to build a general knowledge and skills base. Close integration of theory with practice is facilitated with experience of specialised radiodiagnostic imaging modalities being provided.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Elective placements enable the student to expand their analytical and evaluation skills in a new environment, which broadens the experience and enables recognition of individual approaches to clinical practice (Appendix A and B). International students are not permitted to return to their home country for elective placement.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Level 4</strong></p>
<p>In Level 4 the student undertakes one module “Clinical Practice in Diagnostic Imaging 4” (CP4) including 12 weeks of clinical placement. In the final year, the programme focuses on the consolidation of general radiographic skills. Theory is integrated with practice to provide a sound framework for the competent clinical practitioner. The development of high level skills in problem-solving, critical analysis, evaluation and appraisal will prepare the student for continuing professional development and life-long learning in a multi-professional environment.</p>

Fitness to practise has been interpreted to mean that a person has the skills, knowledge, character and health to undertake their professional role safely and effectively. This means we need to consider whether students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have a long-term health condition or disability which could prevent them from practising safely without supervision;</li>\n<li>have any criminal convictions or cautions which could make them unsuitable for registration;</li>\n<li>have demonstrated that they can maintain the standards of conduct expected of a health professional.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The student’s behaviour on placement and in private life has the potential to affect suitability for registration. If the University becomes aware of an issue regarding a student’s behaviour it may initiate Fitness to Practise proceedings. Where there are serious concerns, a Fitness to Practise panel may be convened. The Fitness to Practise panel has the authority to impose a range of sanctions, including requiring a student to suspend study or even to leave the programme.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>For more information, see the <a href=\"/current-students/practice-based-learning/nursing-and-allied-health-programmes-pbl-information/diagnostic-radiography/\" title=\"QMU Fitness to Practice Policy\">QMU Fitness to Practice Policy</a></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) publishes guidance for students and</p>\n<p>registrants about <a href=\"https://www.hcpc-uk.org/concerns/what-we-investigate/fitness-to-practise/\" title=\"Health Care &amp; Professions Council Website\">Fitness to Practise</a> which you may find useful.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 123px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 45px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 50%; height: 45px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Guidance on conduct and ethics for students</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</th>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 45px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hcpc-uk.org/resources/guidance/guidance-on-conduct-and-ethics-for-students/\" title=\"Guidance on conduct and ethics for students\">Guidance on conduct and ethics for students </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 44px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 50%; height: 44px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Guidance on health and character</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</th>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 44px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hcpc-uk.org/resources/guidance/guidance-on-health-and-character/\" title=\"Guidance on health and character\">Guidance on health and character</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\">Standards of education and training guidance</th>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hcpc-uk.org/resources/standards/standards-of-education-and-training/\" title=\"Standards of education and training\">Standards of education and training </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\">Confidentiality - guidance for registrants</th>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hcpc-uk.org/standards/meeting-our-standards/confidentiality/\" title=\"Confidentiality\">Confidentiality</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Evaluation of this progression is supported by continuous formative assessment and progress mapping.</p>\n<p>Continuous Clinical Assessment utilises progressive achievement levels in domains of diagnostic radiographic practice, providing quantitative analysis and qualitative assessment of competence through evaluation and monitoring of the development of clinical, technical and professional skills.</p>\n<p>The student, in discussion with the clinical supervisor, is required to identify learning outcomes for each placement week. Daily discussions and feedback encourages the student to reflect and review their clinical practice and promote a team supervisory approach to student learning. Students will also be asked to provide written feedback to the departments with regard to their experiences.</p>\n<p>The student will be required to complete a clinical activity log throughout the continuous assessment, and elective placements. The clinical log provides evidence of interaction and participation in the clinical environment.

Those who do not achieve the minimum required standard will have results presented to the examination board for judgment and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval.</p>\n<p><strong>In CP2</strong> (Appendix N), the student will gain enough clinical expertise to allow supervised and directed practice. To achieve a pass in CP2, the student must, by the end of CP2, demonstrate a minimum rating of ‘C’ overall. Those who do not achieve the minimum required standard will have results presented to the examination board for judgment and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval.</p>\n<p><strong>In CP3</strong> (Appendix O and P), the student learns to integrate and sequence skill elements to be able to perform an entire task. As CP3 progresses, they will be able to consistently perform, under supervision, entire procedures in routine situations. To achieve a pass in CP3, the student must, by the end of CP3, demonstrate a minimum rating of ‘C’ in each domain of practice for general placements and a minimum rating of ‘D’ for specialist placements (MRI, CT, Ultrasound, for example). Fluoroscopy and general paediatric placements are NOT specials. Those who do not achieve the minimum required standard will have results presented to the examination board for judgment and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval.</p>\n<p><strong>In CP4</strong> (Appendix Q), students learn to adapt their skills to enable the performance of tasks in routine, non-routine and complex situations. They will be able to plan, organise and prioritise multiple tasks appropriately, under supervision.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>These skills should be considered as elements of clinical competence. As the individual gains experience and knowledge, the basic skills are combined and integrated into overall professional competence which will enable the graduate to apply their skills in a flexible manner whilst responding imaginatively to new and unfamiliar situations. To achieve a pass in CP4, the student must, by the end of CP4, demonstrate a minimum rating of ‘C’ in each domain of practice. Those who do not achieve the minimum required standard will have results presented to the examination board for judgment and may be timetabled appropriately to enable retrieval.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Domains of Practice</strong></p>\n<p>In order to evaluate and monitor competence in Diagnostic Radiography it is necessary to identify the elements of competent practice. The application of domains of practice allows recognition of professional skills, which are essential components of clinical, technical and interpersonal competence.

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Clinical Education placements have a theoretical as well as a practical focus. They provide clear opportunities for students to develop, evaluate, organise and build upon academic learning in a progressive fashion. They enable integration of theory with practice and the safe, effective assimilation of the student into the multidisciplinary health care team.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Clinical and academic blocks are integrated programme elements and should not be viewed as standing alone. Lecturers, Clinical Tutors, Student Liaison Officers, Practice Assessors, Practice Educators, Supervisors and all members of the multidisciplinary department teams facilitate continuous linking of theory with practice and provide sound student support. Clinical education for students of diagnostic radiography is delivered from imaging departments in the Astley Ainslie Hospital, Edinburgh; Ayr Hospital; Borders General Hospital, Melrose; Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock; East of Scotland Breast Screening Service, Edinburgh; Edinburgh Dental Institute; East Lothian Community Hospital; Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; Forth Valley Royal, Larbert; Lauriston Building, Edinburgh; Leith Community Treatment Centre, Edinburgh; Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh; Midlothian Community Hospital, Dalkeith; Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline; St John’s Hospital, Livingston; Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy; Western General Hospital, Edinburgh. Information regarding staffing and available modalities may be found in the Clinical Placement Handbook.</p>
<p>These organisations provide guided experiential learning through supervised direct patient contact and allow opportunities to develop personal confidence and professional competence. They facilitate the acquisition of clinical judgment skills and the expertise required to become a competent practitioner and effective member of the multidisciplinary health care team. The quality of your clinical experience is based on an effective partnership between Queen Margaret University, the placement site and yourself. This partnership is regularly monitored to ensure compliance with the <a href="https://www.nes.scot.nhs.uk/education-and-training/by-discipline/nursing-and-midwifery/practice-education/quality-management-of-the-practice-learning-environment-(qmple)/quality-standards-for-practice-placements-(revised-2008).aspx" title="NHS Scotland Education">Quality Standards for Practice Placements</a>.</p>
<p>The Clinical Education Programme includes elements of clinical supervision, clinical workshops, tutorials and clinical assessment and, with emphases on communication and reflection, enables students to acquire the clinical competencies required to be eligible to apply for registration with the Health and Care Professions Council. Students will also acquire the investigative and analytical skills necessary to enhance the knowledge base of the profession.</p>
