<p><span class="lead">Advice to students</span></p>
<p>It is likely that the strike action will mean that some classes will be cancelled and coursework affected. However, <strong>we are asking students to attend classes and engage with course material (whether on campus or online) unless advised otherwise.</strong> We will endeavour to tell student via email or the Hub if any of their classes are cancelled but this might not always be possible as UCU members do not have to tell the University in advance if they are taking strike action.</p>
<p>It is our strong view that students should not be penalised because of this national dispute, and we will do all we can to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>We know that union members along with all staff members genuinely care about the academic welfare of students, and some may have already told students about their plans. During the period of the action, everyone will be able to enter and leave the campus freely.</p>
<p>Please be assured that the University leadership team understands the strength of feeling amongst staff. We continue to address at a local level the issues that underlie the dispute at a national level.</p>
<p>We continue to be committed to ensuring fair and equitable working conditions for all, and to continuing our positive work with colleagues in UCU, EIS and UNISON trade unions, to make further improvements.</p>
<p>We reiterate that we will do all we can to minimise disruption.</p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<h1><span class="lead">Update issued on 20 February 2023:</span></h1>
<h1>Industrial action paused: no strikes now scheduled to take place until 16 March</h1>
<p>We are pleased to advise that industrial action scheduled for February and early March will not take place. </p>
<p>The trade union UCU has confirmed that following progress in discussions regarding pay, planned industrial action scheduled for week commencing 20 February and 27 February across the higher education sector will no longer go ahead.  Alongside this, the trade union UNISON has cancelled industrial action scheduled for this week. </p>
<p><strong>This means that there will no strikes on 21, 22, 23, 27 and 28 February, and 1 and 2 March.</strong></p>
<p>As things stand, UCU still has strikes scheduled for 16, 17.20, 21, and 22 March.</p>
<p><strong>End of update issued on 20 February 2023</strong></p>
<p><span class="lead">Original announcement: </span></p>
<p>The University and College Union (UCU) has recently balloted its members for a period of industrial action and has notified the University that it is calling on its members to take 18 days of strike action between February and March 2023. <br /><br />This strike action is in response to the new JNCHES 22/23 pay offer which, following national pay bargaining negotiations, was implemented by the University effective from 1 August 2022. A number of UCU members also continue to participate in continuous action short of a strike (ASOS).</p>]]></Value>
