      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The MA Applied Arts and Social Practice course will allow students to develop a better understanding of how artists, theatre practitioners, musicians and other creatives apply their skills in social contexts such as third sector organisations, public health, social welfare or education, while also giving them the practical and enterprise skills to develop a sustainable career in their chosen field.</p>
<p>Located in the birthplace of the world’s biggest arts festival – the Edinburgh Festival Fringe – students at QMU will benefit from being within arm’s reach of a plethora of cultural and third sector organisations, many of which are already connected to the University through its extensive alumni and lecturer networks. The course has already secured partnerships with various cultural organisations – theatres, art galleries, and more - providing students with the option of relevant work experience during their studies.</p>
<p>Co-Programme leader, Dr Anthony Schrag, said: “This new MA will appeal to a wide variety of people. There will be those who are already working within the fields of applied arts who wish to embed their practice and get to into the depths of more theory, but there are also going to be people who already work in – for example – education and outreach and healthcare projects, who wish to know more about the applied arts side.”</p>
<p>As one of the only courses in Scotland which looks at this subject from a practical, experiential level, students will benefit from undertaking a practice-based project in place of a traditional dissertation to further hone their skills in preparation for implementing their learning in industry.</p>
<p>Dr Schrag added: “Students can guide their dissertation project in a way that is unique and specific to them, which allows them to really focus on their own learning and produce something that is individually theirs. Together, these elements make the course unique in that the student drives their learning and follows the path that’s best for them.”</p>
<p>In offering a combination of theoretical and practical learning, in addition to the opportunity to learn from experts with their fingers on the pulse, QMU is set to support Scotland in its emerging role as a leader in engaging communities in the arts.</p>
