      "title": "1.\tThe University",
      "content": "<p><strong>1.1 History</strong></p>\n<p>Queen Margaret University can trace its origins to the foundation in 1875 of the Edinburgh School of Cookery, an institution that operated throughout mainland Britain, pioneering the training of teachers in nutrition, public health and domestic science.</p>\n<p>Under our previous title of Queen Margaret College, our courses were accredited by the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) from 1975 to 1992. We raised the majority of our programmes to Honours degree level and developed our research activities throughout that period. We were granted taught degree and research degree powers by the Privy Council in 1992 and 1998 respectively, and the title ‘Queen Margaret University College’ in 1999.</p>\n<p>We achieved full University title in 2007, the year in which we also relocated to our campus just outside the City of Edinburgh, at Musselburgh. The first complete university campus to be built in Scotland in a generation, the campus was designed with a brief to place students at the centre of the learning environment.</p>\n<p>While the University may be considered a relatively small institution in UK Higher Education terms, we have grown our student population to 9,910 in 2022/23; comprising 5,130 students based in Edinburgh and 4,780 students studying QMU degrees at partner institutions in the UK and overseas.</p>\n<p><strong>1.2 Purpose, Values and Strategic Direction</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/97672263ea164cf694e054a0c2983031}\" title=\"Our Strategic Plan\">University Strategy 2020-25</a>, and the accompanying Delivery Plan, sets out how we will respond to evolutionary change, building on the University’s key strengths, adapting to overcome obstacles and creating new areas of strength. In so doing, the Plan draws on the University’s heritage, holding true to the principles and values on which the University was founded.</p>\n<p>We see our <strong>Purpose</strong> as helping to create a better society through education, research and innovation and by providing a supportive and creative learning environment in which students and staff thrive. In seeking to fulfil this purpose, we are clear and realistic about our strengths, focussed on strategic goals, persistent in pursuing opportunities and overcoming barriers and guided by our values.</p>\n<p>Our purpose is underpinned by our <strong>Values</strong>. We are a university that is modern in its outlook and facilities, but with a maturity built on a long history of serving the community, both locally and globally, and enhancing its wellbeing. We work in a transparent and inclusive manner and hold to core values in everything we do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We value <strong>intellectual curiosity</strong> and the journey of discovery: We design our teaching and research to facilitate this.</li>\n<li>We value <strong>social justice</strong>: We embrace equality, diversity, inclusion, respect, and supporting our communities. These underpin our world view. Opportunities and access are open to all and on a fair basis.</li>\n<li>We value <strong>excellence</strong>: This is embedded in our research, teaching and learning, knowledge exchange and the services we provide. It will be exemplified in the experience of our students, staff and partners.</li>\n<li>We value <strong>ambition</strong>: We inspire our students and staff to achieve the best that they can. We pursue opportunities, often in partnership and collaboration with others, to transform and influence society for the better and enhance our visibility within the higher education sector and the wider economy.</li>\n<li>We value <strong>environmental sustainability</strong>: We recognise the severe threats to our environment and will be a sector leader in response. Our modern campus is a great asset in this work.</li>\n<li>We value <strong>the individual</strong> and encourage <strong>collective support</strong>: Each member of staff and each student has their own journey to make and their own contribution to give. Queen Margaret University provides the supportive environment to facilitate this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To fulfil our purpose we have developed a set of strategic goals, with associated outputs, that are underpinned by our values and our alignment to the internal and external environment. These are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide distinctive, accessible, high-quality education.</li>\n<li>deliver transformative research and innovation.</li>\n<li>seek out partnership and collaboration.</li>\n<li>invest in the long-term future of the university.</li>\n<li>embed sustainability across our portfolio and practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our strategic plan continues to find expression in a number of discrete sub-strategies, including those of Student Experience and Research and Knowledge Exchange. For each of these, we publish high level outcomes, or key performance indicators (KPIs), progress on which is reported quarterly to the University Court, University Senate and to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT).</p>\n<p>Research continues to be central to our strategy. The vitality of our research culture promotes synergy between research, knowledge exchange, teaching and other activities, enhancing each individual element of our work.</p>\n<p>The REF 2021 results confirm the high quality of our research, its strong global reach, and the positive impact that its work is having in addressing many of the world’s most pressing social, economic and cultural issues. The University submitted research to REF 2021 under seven themes (REF 2021 Units of Assessment), and the expert peer review panels for REF 2021 confirmed that we had world-leading or internationally excellent research in every one of these themes. Our research was rated as world-leading in six out of the seven REF Units of Assessment to which we submitted work.</p>\n<p>International competitiveness in research is fundamental to our Knowledge Exchange strategy, which is based on the translation of excellent research to the Scottish indigenous SME base. Our particular offering is that our research in food and drink, rehabilitation sciences, creative industries and hospitality and tourism is accessible and has a direct economic, cultural and societal impact for Scotland. Our aim is to understand society and enhance it, to connect local and international perspectives, to engage the public and external stakeholders and to make significant contributions to policy, planning and development.</p>\n<p>Our partnership with East Lothian Council to develop an Innovation Park has at its core an ambition to contribute directly to the economic prosperity of the region, and beyond. We have worked to develop the concept for the Innovation Park, such work contributing to the securing of Edinburgh and East of Scotland City Deal funding, of £30 million. The Innovation Park includes a planned expansion of our Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation (SCFDI), together with commercial space for growing SMEs. The intention is to deliver specialist and generic research and business support services, together with development facilities for target SMEs. The proposal aligns with a number of national policies, including Scotland Food and Drink’s strategic plan ‘Ambition 2030’, the Scottish Government’s Economic Strategy, and the UK Government’s updated Industrial Strategy.</p>\n<p>We are committed to widening participation amongst students who have previously been inhibited from entering Higher Education for social, economic or cultural reasons but also to taking active steps to maximise their persistence and success. We have adopted a definition of ‘under-represented groups’ that has extended beyond that of the narrow Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) national indicator and have developed a range of initiatives to increase the participation and retention of those from a broad range of non-traditional groups.</p>\n<p>Our widening participation strategy seeks to increase student numbers from non-traditional groups, including those that are first generation to go to Higher Education; from low progression schools; reside in communities in the lowest 20% and 40% of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (MD20); articulating students from Scotland’s Colleges, disabled students, or those who are Care Leavers.</p>\n<p>At 2%, QMU shares the lowest level of unemployment in Scotland for its graduates 15 months after they have graduated. The average figure for Scotland is 5%. (Graduate Outcome Statistics 2018/19, published by HESA in 2023).</p>"

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for your interest in the University Court of Queen Margaret University.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to contribute to a university with strong <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/413d4ec0e892494b8886b3bb3d6fffd7}" title="Our Purpose and Values">values,</a> committed to creating a better society through education, research and innovation and by providing a supportive and creative learning environment in which students and staff thrive.</p>
<p>The University Court, which is the University’s governing body, is seeking to appoint to vacancies arising in its independent (Lay) membership over the calendar year 2023. Details of the current composition of the University Court can be found on the <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/c69dfb00ccc947b48360bbab8f2ca385}" title="Court">University's website</a>.</p>
<p>The appointment process is being overseen by the Nominations Committee of the Court. Members of the Nominations Committee are committed to ensuring that the process for appointment supports fully the University’s commitment to securing an appropriate balance of independent members on the University Court in terms of equality and diversity. This commitment aligns with the University’s purpose and values. We see our Purpose as helping to create a better society through education, research and innovation, and by providing a supportive and creative learning environment in which students and staff thrive. That purpose is underpinned by our Values, which embrace equality, diversity, inclusion, respect, and supporting our communities. Opportunities and access are open to all and on a fair basis.</p>
<p>In appointing to vacancies we are looking to rebalance and, in some areas, enhance the Court in terms of membership skills and experience; and in terms of member diversity, to better reflect the communities the university serves. We recognise the value that diversity of perspectives and lived experiences brings to Court, and therefore would welcome and encourage applications from people who identify as Black, Asian or from a Minority Ethnic background, and to preserve gender balance on the Court in accordance with the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018, we would welcome and encourage applications from women.</p>
<p>Set out in the pages that follow are the key responsibilities of the role of a Lay Member of Court, together with a description of the qualities and experience being sought in candidates for appointment.</p>
<p>If you share our values and ambition, and are able to subscribe to the commitments set out in this document, we would welcome your application warmly. For an informal discussion on this role, please contact Irene Hynd at ihynd@qmu.ac.uk.</p>
<p>Irene Hynd, University Secretary and Secretary to the University Court<br />July 2023</p>]]></Value>
