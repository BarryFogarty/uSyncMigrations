They use a range of high-technology imaging equipment and techniques and work closely with the multidisciplinary team to provide a person-centred service.</p>\n<p>Radiography is invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and trauma. As a diagnostic radiographer your skill, judgement and professionalism will be a vital part of a team’s clinical work, and affect patients’ lives, day after day. Awaiting a diagnosis can be a stressful time for patients and in this career you must be technically adept, an excellent communicator and provide person-centred care. This is why our diagnostic radiography course places high importance on clinical placements. Placements are essential to build self-confidence, practice radiographic techniques and develop clinical knowledge in a real-life hospital setting.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn from staff with an outstanding reputation for the quality of teaching;</li>\n<li>gain all the knowledge and skills that you require to work as a diagnostic radiographer;</li>\n<li>develop your expertise through in-depth theoretical learning, clinical placements each year and the close support of our very experienced staff; and</li>\n<li>Benefit from the interprofessional working focus of this course.

There will be a mix of classroom and online learning. Outwith timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of assessment methods (eg written and practical exams, written assignments, presentations and viva voce) at the end of each module. </p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will complete practice placements in each year. You will attend a variety of placements within the NHS at various locations across Scotland. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by our Master of Radiography: Diagnostic (MDRad)/BSc (Hons) Radiography: Diagnostic and MSc Diagnostic Radiography (Pre-Registration) courses. We have one dedicated Diagnostic Radiography room to practice technical and professional skills, with fully functioning x-ray equipment. Our diagnostic radiography students also utilise QMU's Clinical Simulation Suite, Physiotherapy and Podiatry skills rooms which are equipped to simulate the real-life placement environment. Students have access to numerous anatomy models which are incorporated into their learning during practical sessions and can be used during self-directed study sessions.   </p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Diagnostic radiographers are healthcare professionals who acquire and evaluate images of the human body to diagnose injuries and illnesses such as bone fractures and kidney stones. This four year undergraduate master's/BSc (Hons) degree course will give you the theoretical understanding and practical skills you will need to build a rewarding career as a diagnostic radiographer. Practice placements are an integrated part of the course and allow you to put your theoretical knowledge into practice. </span></p>
<p>QMU offers two undergraduate pathways of study in Diagnostic Radiography to achieve a recognised qualification. Initially all students register on the undergraduate master’s pathway and study together, then, from the end of the second year, students on the BSc (Hons) pathway follow a slightly different programme of study to those studying for the undergraduate master’s degree. On graduation, both pathways offer eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a diagnostic radiographer.</p>
<p>Please see the course structure on this page for more information on the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/">benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>]]></Value>
