A UK Government funded asymptomatic testing site opens today (30 November) at Queen Margaret University (QMU), Edinburgh. The site is running in partnership between QMU, the Scottish Government and NHS Test and Protect, to support our students to move home for the winter break and protect the wider community.

An asymptomatic testing site (ATS) of lateral flow tests is launching at Queen Margaret’s campus in Musselburgh, as part of the Government’s UK-wide continuing drive to increase the availability of mass testing. In addition to limiting social mixing for two weeks prior to going home, testing will help to break the chain of transmission amongst students, especially when they are infected but are not aware of it, and help to ensure the safety of their loved ones.

Queen Margaret University is working with NHS Test & Protect to set up this on-campus ATS so that students who intend to move household over the winter break and are without symptoms, are able to get tested and asked to self-isolate if they test positive, or be quickly reassured if they do not.

QMU’s Principal, Sir Paul Grice, said: “We are delighted to be able to offer this facility. While many of our students will remain in Edinburgh and East Lothian, we know that many others are planning to change household or to visit family and friends over the winter break. By participating in testing, they will help avoid the spread of COVID to their family, friends and the wider community.”

Testing is available for all students. For more information, please visit http://www.qmu.ac.uk/coronavirus.
