      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Over-arching principles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All awards of QMU will include the academic content expected for that subject. The depth and complexity of knowledge will be appropriate for the academic level of the award.</li>
<li>Degrees that relate to a profession or a particular field of employment will include the skills and knowledge needed to work in that field.</li>
<li>Whatever the area of study, QMU has a commitment to support learners in the development of Graduate Attributes that will aid them in their future life, and allow them to make a positive contribution to society.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graduate Attributes should be a meaningful expression of our aspirations as a University, reflecting our values and the role of graduates in society;</li>
<li>Graduate Attributes should provide a facilitative framework and not be viewed as an administrative hurdle;</li>
<li>Graduate Attributes refer to the added value that flows from study at QMU, not the baseline expectations for learners entering programmes of study;</li>
<li>They should be articulated in language that is easily accessible and understood by all key groups including students, academic and other staff, employers;</li>
<li>Graduate Attributes should inform the design and delivery of all programmes within QMU, but there will be flexibility in the way in which these are expressed, implemented and recorded. This is to allow the language used to describe these Attributes and approaches to implementation to reflect subject and profession-specific contexts;</li>
<li>The same framework of Graduate Attributes should cover both undergraduate (at SCQF Level 10 and below) and postgraduate. The way in which programme teams apply the Framework will be flexible to the context, location and level of learning;</li>
<li>The implementation of Graduate Attributes must take into account issues of parity. Where Attributes are addressed directly within curricula there should be no problems arising, but where Attributes rely on extra-curricular activities staff need to be mindful of differential access to opportunities (e.g. students with caring or work commitments may have fewer opportunities to engage in voluntary activities).</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of attributes is below, along with further explanation for each attribute.</p>]]></Value>

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Graduate attributes</strong></p>
<p>Graduate attributes refer to the <em>additional</em> skills and attributes developed through degree level study, beyond the core subject knowledge covered by the curriculum. </p>
<p>In addition to academic knowledge and professional skills, QMU awards will help graduates to develop personal attributes that will aid them in their future life, whatever career choices they make.</p>
<p>QMU's Graduate attributes policy can be downloaded <a href="/{localLink:umb://media/1ac1a930182044619c3b83db252da463}" title="Graduate Attributes">here</a>.</p>]]></Value>
