      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This special event will also shed light on the creative process involved in making and producing film – from idea, to paper, to screen.</p>
<p>For the last few years, Rick has made a transatlantic trip to Scotland to share his love of film with Queen Margaret University audiences. His fascinating accounts of the creative process and the challenges that artists and filmmakers overcome to bring their work into the public domain, has both intrigued and inspired young filmmakers. Those who were lucky enough to hear him during his last visit will testify to his engaging style and his ability to make his audience both laugh and shed a tear at his heart-felt tales.</p>
<p>Richard Bent from QMU’s Business School, said: “If you’ve ever wondered where filmmakers find their concept - how they develop them - and finally how they create successful productions, this is an opportunity not to be missed. Some are poignant, others are funny and there will be one or two that will touch your heart. Whatever your film preference, Rick’s selection will be sure to have you talking about movies for days!”</p>
<p>Currently, Rick is engaged in the research and development of emerging technologies in experiential storytelling, including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Alternate Reality Gaming (ARG) in Universal’s ‘Halloween Horror Night’s’ critically acclaimed attraction ‘The Repository’. The audience can hear from Rick first-hand how this horror attraction was inspired by a previous trip to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>In recent years, Rick Spencer has provided scripting and show direction for the grand opening of the ‘Wizarding World of Harry Potter’ and ‘Despicable Me – the Minion Mayhem’. His credits also include the feature length motion picture ‘Thunderborn’ and the television series ‘Shining Time Station’ starring ‘Thomas the Tank Engine’. Universal’s interactive website content and live entertainment for ‘Halloween Horror Nights’ (from 2013 – 2018) including an Addy Award as director for the ‘Legendary Truth Interactive Websites’, specializing in experiential storytelling.</p>
<p>As well as being Creative Manager for the Universal Orlando Resort, Rick is author of five novels: ‘Icebound - The Viking Cipher’, ‘all that Glitters’, ‘The Money master’, ‘Terror Merchants’ and ‘The Devil’s Mirror’. His private clients include Paul McCartney’s MPL Communications, Time Warner and National Public Radio.</p>
<p>The event, to be held on Thursday 28<sup>th</sup> March from 6pm–8pm at QMU, promises to be entertaining, informative and inspirational.</p>
<p>The event is free but ticketed. Tickets will be allocated on a first come, first served basis.</p>]]></Value>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Notes to Editor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual reality (VR)</strong> is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory feedback like haptic. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical.</li>
<li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>is a technology that takes the world around you and adds virtual content on top such that it looks like it's actually there in the real world.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate Reality Gaming (ARG)</strong> is the use of existing places, people and history to create a different version of reality. ARG is very popular in marketing campaigns like those created for Batman.</li>
</ul>
