On those occasions where the partner legislation must take precedence, Principal Investigator’s (PI) are required to clearly document the rationale of the benefits of research / KE activity and develop a relevant Risk Assessment and Mitigation Protocol, as per QMU research ethics procedures, laying out specific safeguarding measures for the planned research / KE activity. These arrangements must be clearly recorded and approved through the University ethics procedures. Ethical approval can only be granted by the University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) if such conditions are met. To ensure the highest standards of safeguarding in international research and KE activities, all researchers should be familiar with the  <a href=\"https://ukcdr.org.uk/publication/ukcdr-guidance-on-safeguarding-in-international-development-research/\">UKCDR Guidance on Safeguarding in International Development Research</a>.</p>\n<p>QMU staff and students are always expected to personally act to the highest standards with regard to safeguarding, as detailed in the University’s Safeguarding Policy, Procedure and Framework. However, it is recognised that we cannot impose our own internal policies/procedures on our research and KE partners, which is why dialogue is encouraged amongst our partners around this issue.</p>\n<p>This Guidance on Safeguarding in Research and KE aims to ensure that any concerns, complaints or allegations are directed to and dealt with by the most appropriate existing University policy or procedure or external legal requirements.
