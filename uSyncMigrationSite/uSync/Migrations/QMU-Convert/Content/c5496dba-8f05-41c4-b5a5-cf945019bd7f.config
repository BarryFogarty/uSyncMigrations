      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Thank you very much for working with our student teachers in these challenging times.</p>
<p>At QMU, we understand the COVID19 pandemic has impacted on school life and we appreciate the pressures schools are currently facing. We are very grateful for your continued partnership and support for our student teachers. We recognise that the ongoing COVID19 situation means that student teachers’ experience in schools may look slightly different to normal. We want to reassure you that we understand that this is necessary.</p>
<p>As a result of the restrictions placed on Universities, it has been necessary to alter pedagogical approaches. Nevertheless, we have worked hard to present student teachers with high-quality risk-assessed learning experiences, which will provide them with key skills and knowledge to succeed on placement. Our programmes have tried to ensure students are able to teach outdoors (FOLA award), teach online, understand Child Protection processes, learn to understand pupil behaviour and relevant coping strategies, and to use play based learning (Primary).</p>
<p>In consultation with our LA Partners, Head teachers and based on guidance from ADES, GTCS, SCDES) in particular, there will be the following changes:</p>
<p>1. Students will need to undertake a risk assessment exercise with a member of school staff before the start of placement using the school’s or LA’s risk assessment proforma.</p>
<p>2. The student is expected to submit a signed checklist to the university to inform us that they have complied with your regulations at school.</p>
<p>3. School-based Educators should arrange for a period of observation to allow students to become familiar with school procedures and hygiene protocols.</p>
<p>4. Student teachers should not be expected to teach unsupported from day one of the placement.</p>
<p>5. If a student teacher cannot attend the placement school because of the imposition of lockdown or a requirement to self-isolate, then they would be asked to support the work of the school by engaging online to support learning and timetabled classes.</p>
<p>6. University Tutors will not visit in-person, unless necessary and in agreement with the school. Details of approach to the assessment of school experience are detailed below.</p>
<p>Student teachers will be expected to follow all of the same procedures that school staff are already following. During the University-based elements of their programme, student teachers have been informed that, at all times, they need to follow all the public health advice and procedures that have been issued by <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" target="_blank">The Scottish Government</a>; the interactive tool for students used alongside the guidance Easy Read formats), the school, and the Local Authority in which they undertake placement. Student teachers have also been advised to download NHS Scotland’s free Protect Scotland app.</p>
<p><strong>Approach to Assessment for School Experience Semester 1 2020-21</strong></p>
<p>In consultation with our partner Local Authorities, University Tutors will not make in person visits to schools during Semester 1. This decision reflects our efforts to relieve pressure on the school system as a whole. It also recognises that in the current context visitors and other professionals are not able to visit schools, as they normally would, because of the restrictions in place. In addition, in most Local Authorities staff meetings are likely to be fully online and staff are unable (or severely restricted) to meet in person on 2<br />school premises for planning discussions. This does vary between schools/LAs. This approach to assessment:</p>
<p>• minimises risk of transmission and disruption from localised restrictions, lockdowns or self-isolation<br />• considers the wellbeing and safety of our students and staff<br />• enables us to work in partnership, to be proactive in our planning and ensure we are able to offer alternative approaches to assessment which are robust and fair.</p>
<p>This decision sits within the scope outlined in the Joint Agreement (ADES/GTCS/SCDE/SPMG) COVID-19 Guidance for Student Teacher Placements.</p>
<p>Placements will still be assessed, and University Tutors will continue to lead the process, working in partnership with School-based Educators. Working within the framework of the Taught Assessment Regulations, and the requirements of the GTCS, individual programmes will be able to tailor the approach to assessing school experiences to take into consideration placement structures and local circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>The overarching principles informing our approach include:</strong></p>
<p>• University Tutors remain core to the assessment process, although this will be done via alternative approaches.<br />• Schools/supporting teachers are not being asked or expected to undertake any additional responsibility for the assessment of student teachers.<br />• There will be no overall increase in workload for school staff as a result of this process.<br />• Assessment is conducted in partnership and remains an essential component of the process.<br />• As far as possible the approaches taken will build on the processes already embedded into the placement structure.<br />• As is already the case, a clear process for early identification of any emerging issues or potential cause for concern is established.<br />• If a cause for concern is raised and, through dialogue between school and university, an exceptional case may need to be made for an on-site visit. This should be possible if safe to do so and in agreement with both school and University.</p>
<p>A detailed overview of the specific approach to assessment for placement will be outlined in the relevant handbook and will be clearly communicated to all students and staff. We intend to hold Q &amp; A sessions nearer to the commencement of placements but will continue to share information with you at relevant points in the year. In the meantime, please contact Geetha Marcus, Academic Lead for Placements, should you have any queries or concerns regarding this document.</p>
