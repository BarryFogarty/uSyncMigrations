In particular DORA seeks to address the practice of using journal impact factors as a proxy for quality.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Further frameworks have emerged since the publication of DORA (2013) on the use of quantitative research indicators in the assessment and management of research and QMU is committed to the recommendations of the FFRM Report, the <a href=\"https://responsiblemetrics.org/2022/08/11/the-metric-tide-revisited/\" title=\"The Metric Tide Revisited\">Metric Tide (2015)</a> and the principles of the <a href=\"http://www.leidenmanifesto.org\" title=\"LEIDEN MANIFESTO FOR RESEARCH METRICS\">Leiden Manifesto (2015).</a></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In 2017 the FFRM partnership between HEFCE (now Research England), Research Councils UK, the Wellcome Trust, Universities UK and JISC, was created to develop a series of initiatives to support the responsible use of metrics in the HE sector and research organisations across the UK. Although the FFRM focuses on the recommendations made in the Metric Tide Report it supports the principles set out in both Leiden and DORA.</p>\n<p>The Leiden Manifesto brings together accepted but disparate principles of good practice in research evaluation. The manifesto represents the “distillation of best practice in metrics-based research assessment so that researchers can hold evaluators to account and evaluators can hold their indicators to account”.</p>\n<p>Both of these initiatives have come from groups of researchers who share a concern with the way the outputs from research are evaluated by funders, academic publishers, institutions and other parties. While appreciating the value of quantitative research metrics, they are concerned about their inappropriate use in decision making, for example around the allocation of funds and in academic career progression.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

These are derived from the data found in Web of Science, Scopus, or in Google Scholar. These metrics are used in many commonly used sources, such as on publisher's journal web sites and in QMU reports derived from eResearch. It is important that all staff involved in research, and not just those directly involved in the assessment of research, have an understanding of the underpinnings, benefits and limitation of these indicators and their responsible use.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Altmetrics</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Alternative metrics ('altmetrics') are a relatively new kind of indicator which provide information about attention to research outputs in social media such as Twitter and also information about captures, shares and number of views and downloads. There are still many uncertainties about these developing metrics, including about their reliability. The FFRM therefore recommends that altmetrics should not be used in REF style evaluations of outputs although there may be some value in their use in assessment of impact.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
