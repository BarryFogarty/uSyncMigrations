      <Value><![CDATA[<p class="txtMainBlack">Before studying at QMU, Samantha had already achieved a BSc Media Communication from the University of Wuerzburg in Germany and volunteered in the local public relations department AIESEC, a student-led organisation promoting international exchange. After completing this voluntary position, Samantha knew she wanted to work in PR and communications.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Samantha has also completed a six month corporate communications internship with the sportswear company, Puma, in Herzogenaurach, near Nuremberg in Bavaria, Germany, where she worked with people from around the world. It was through this internship that Samantha decided she would like to study abroad.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Why did you choose to study MSc Strategic Communication and Public Relations at QMU? </strong></p>
<p>“Through my online research, I found that there were more specific postgraduate programmes in strategic communication and public relations offered in the UK, including the course offered by QMU. I also wanted to get concrete knowledge about PR theory, as well as practical application.</p>
<p>“The modules are really interesting and include a lot of digital communication elements. The staff at QMU are very helpful and supportive too.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>How do you find the workload?</strong></p>
<p>“The workload is manageable, especially as we’re mostly able to tailor assignment topics according our interests within the thought module area, but it can be quite stressful when deadlines are looming.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Have you received any financial support towards your studies?</strong></p>
<p>“I get partially funded by the German Government through a fund known as Bafoeg. I’m very grateful for this support as I couldn’t afford to study here without it.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Have you taken advantage of any personal development initiatives offered by QMU?</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve just signed up to the QMU Employer Mentoring Programme. The programme gives students the opportunity to meet with an experienced individual from a relevant sector, who is willing to offer their time, advice and inside knowledge surrounding the world of work.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>What is your top tip for future students?</strong></p>
<p>“Make yourself familiar with timetables, modules and create your own structure to organise your time to space out the workload a bit.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Why did you decide to live and study in Edinburgh?</strong></p>
<p>“I visited Edinburgh on a school trip when I was in high school, so I knew I’d like it here. It’s simply amazing how beautifully ancient this city looks, I sometimes feel like I’m walking through a Harry Potter film set, and I love it!”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Are you combining part-time work with study?</strong></p>
<p>“I’m now working as a part-time International Conversion Assistant at QMU. I feel like I can perfectly combine work and study as I take care of social media and communications. It feels like the ideal preparation for a full-time job as a PR professional.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>What are your plans after graduation?</strong></p>
<p>“I feel that after graduating from QMU I’ll have a great base to progress my career. I’d like to work as an in-house PR Manager rather than an agency, preferably within an international organisation where I can take care of content management, including website and social media.</p>
<p>“I’ll probably return to Germany after graduating because my boyfriend is there, but I could definitely imagine returning to the UK in the future.”</p>
