      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Professor Goldblatt said: “While delivering hundreds of speeches, I have been asked over and over again if I would write my personal and professional memoir. Therefore, I have now recorded my lifetime of experience that includes founding a professional association called the International Live Events Association (ILEA) with over 5000 members in thirty countries throughout the world”.</p>
<p>Mary Contini, author of several published books - “Dear Francesca”, “Dear Olivia”, “Dear Alfonso” and “Valvona &amp; Crolla: A Year at an Italian Table”- reviewed: “Joe Goldblatt is surely one of life’s great optimists. From ‘hair past my shoulders, wearing a knitted head band, and a tie died blue and white kaftan’ to meeting presidents, princesses and consulting with the ‘three wise men,’ Joe Goldblatt has embraced life with enthusiasm, charisma and joy! For Joe everything is possible! A great inspiration”.</p>
<p>Steven Wood Schmader, Certified Festival and Event Executive (CFEE) President &amp; CEO International Festivals &amp; Events Association (IFEA World), upon reading the book, said: "From a young man who started his career parlaying silence into success, to a respected professional voice that reverberates around the globe, Joe Goldblatt continues to create ripples that will shape and impact our industry for generations to follow".</p>
<p>The 275-page book will be published in April 2019 and will also include many rare and exclusive photos from the author’s personal archive. In addition, Professor Goldblatt has produced a five-part video series featuring inspiring stories from the book. Each purchaser of the soft cover copy of ‘The True Joy of Life’ will also receive free access to an audio abridged version of the book narrated by the author. Professor Goldblatt is also happy to personally inscribe individual books upon request.</p>
