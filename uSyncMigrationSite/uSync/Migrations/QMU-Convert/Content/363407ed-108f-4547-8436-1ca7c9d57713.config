The majority of our undergraduate degree courses are modular, most students undertake six modules each academic year (three in each semester).</p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/academic-calendar/\" title=\"Academic Calendar\">Academic Calendar page</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>During term time, teaching is usually between 09:15 and 18:15 Monday to Thursday and 09:15 and 17:15 on Friday, with undergraduate teaching normally ending by 13:15 on Wednesdays to allow participation in sports and societies activities. Timetables are available from mid-July (but subject to change), with continuing students able to see their personal timetables at this time. Efforts are made to make the timetables as student friendly as possible, teaching can take place at any time during the teaching week, and may not be consistent on a week-to-week basis.</p>\n<p> </p>"

The four-year degree system in Scotland is different from that offered in the rest of the UK (although qualifications are recognised and accepted across the UK and internationally). The four-year honours degree is designed to allow students to study their chosen subject in greater depth and breadth. A number of our healthcare courses offer only a four year honours degree option.</p>\n<p>We offer<span> <a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-subject-overviews/health-sciences/\" title=\"Health Sciences\">a range of</a> four-year integrated undergraduate master’s degrees across our range health profession degrees. </span>An integrated master's degree (sometimes referred to as an enhanced undergraduate degree) is a four-year programme which combines both undergraduate and postgraduate level of study into one streamlined course. Students start their chosen course with a view to graduating with a master’s degree in four years, instead of following the traditional model where students complete a master’s degree after completing an undergraduate degree. Years Three and Four of the undergraduate course are taught alongside postgraduate students studying on the relevant Pre-Registration* postgraduate course.</p>\n<p>*Pre-Registration postgraduate courses are for students who already have an undergraduate degree in a relevant area who want to gain a health professional qualification.</p>"
