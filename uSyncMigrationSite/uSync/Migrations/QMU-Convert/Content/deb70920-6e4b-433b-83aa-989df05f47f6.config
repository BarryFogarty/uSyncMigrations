      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong><span>Why did you choose to study at one of QMU’s collaborative partner institutions?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Mainly due to the reputation of QMU and its internationally-recognised degrees, which I believe will open a lot of new doors for me in the future. QMU is well-known for its commitment to academic excellence, and the opportunity to earn a degree with such a prestigious institution was a compelling factor for me.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What interested you about the BA International Hospitality and Tourism Management course?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>The specific course offered by QMU also played a crucial role in my decision-making process as it provides a practical and hands-on approach that aligns with real-life scenarios – something I believe will be invaluable when it comes to job searching.</span> </p>
<p><span>All throughout school, I had a genuine passion for hospitality. When I discovered that the Silver Mountain School of Hotel Management provided a course that not only aligned with my interests, but also offered a comprehensive and practical approach run by QMU, I was convinced that this was the right path for me.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What did you enjoy most about your course?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I enjo</span><span>yed so many different elements of my course! As well as loving the actual academic content, I feel like the course really helped me both personally and professionally – developing my skills in teamwork, leadership, communication, and networking. Beyond the textbooks, it was the hands-on practical experience that brought the les</span><span>sons to life, preparing me for the realities of my future career. The lecturers also made my time at Silver Mountain really memorable, and became like mentors to me.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Were there any particular course activities you found especially interesting?</span></strong> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="I really loved the New Enterprise Creation module as it taught me how to start and run my own business – something I knew I wanted to do. It was also great being involved in the various events that we managed throughout my time on the course – they really helped me improve my organisation skills. " source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p><strong><span>Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Absolutely! My advice would be to just embrace it. The impact this course has had on my knowledge and personal development is something I will never take for granted.</span> </p>
<p><span>It’s also important to recognise the universal applicability of the transferable skills you will gain – there are so many sectors that these skills will prove valuable in, not just the hospitality industry!</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Did you take part in any work placements associated with your course and if so, tell us about them?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I had the amazing opportunity to work at Topgolf in Dubai, a renowned global chain known for its unique entert</span><span>ainment and hospitality.</span> </p>
<p><span>The skills that I picked up during my course proved to be incredibly useful for this experience, helping me adapt to the international working environment. The hands-on experience not only reinforced what I learned in the classroom, but also helped me with my confidence.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Can you tell us about your life following graduation?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>After graduating, I was really fortunate to start my own property management business in Dubai after I realised how much I loved the country during my placement! Over the past five months, my partner and I have built our business from the ground up, with help from an investor. From mastering legal intricacies and administrative tasks to developing marketing strategies and photography, I’ve been able to use so many of the skills that I learned during my time at Silver Mountain, especially entreprene</span><span>urship. It’s been challenging of course, but so rewarding!</span> </p>]]></Value>
