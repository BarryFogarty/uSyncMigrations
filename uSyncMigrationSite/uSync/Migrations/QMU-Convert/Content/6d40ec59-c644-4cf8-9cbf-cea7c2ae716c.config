<p>We value your views on the modules you take, for monitoring, development and quality assurance purposes. All questions are should be answered on a 1-5 scale whereby 1 = “Strongly Agree” and 5 = “Strongly Disagree”.  Please select the response that is closest to your views. There is space at the end of this questionnaire for your comments on the module as well. All responses will remain anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2: Module Information</strong></p>
<p>Module Name:</p>
<p>Module Code:</p>
<p>Module Coordinator:</p>
<p><strong>Section 3: Student Information</strong></p>
<p>Programme (e.g. BSc (Hons) Psychology and Sociology; BA (Hons) Film and Media:</p>
<p>Level of Programme:</p>
<p><strong>Section 4: up to a maximum of 25 questions to be selected by the module coordinator/team.</strong></p>
<p><em>(Questions are to be selected from the University’s list of suggested questions below or developed by each academic lecturer)</em> </p>
<p>The University’s list of module evaluation questions is arranged in four (4) sections: the Environment, Module Structure, the Lecturer, and the Module. Within each section are several sub-sections with differing emphases: however, some questions could be placed equally easily in several sub-sections. </p>
<p>It is suggested that each lecturer selects up to 25 questions from the list to construct their own questionnaire for each module for which they are module coordinator.  </p>
<p>It is intended that the list of up to 25 questions address the four sections and that a minimum number of questions from each section below are selected as follows: two questions from Section 1; three questions from Section 2; five questions from Section 3; and five questions from Section 4.</p>
<p>All questions should be answered on a 1-5 scale whereby 1 = "Strongly Disagree" and 5 = "Strongly Agree". </p>
