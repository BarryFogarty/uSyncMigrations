      "content": "<p>‘Applied Art’ is a contested term and we don’t aim to define a single approach, but instead seek to support creative processes/skills operating within particular social contexts. This could include any creative practice (such as theatre, art, music, dance or puppetry, just to name a few) that does not exist in traditional spaces (such as museums, theatres or galleries) but rather is based alongside and with individuals and communities in the public domain.</p>\n<p>Over the past three decades within the UK, there has been a significant and sustained growth of the arts within a social context. Indeed, the current draft Cultural Strategy in Scotland looks at embedding artistic and creative practices across numerous sectors, inviting artists, theatre makers, musicians and all creative practitioners to be productive within industry, business, education and social settings.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the arts are becoming more important within health and wellbeing contexts and the recent national report ‘Creative Health: Arts for Health and Wellbeing’ calls for artists to play a vital role in the social health and wellbeing of the population to the extent that GPs in England can prescribe artistic activities in order to tackle social issues such as obesity, loneliness and depression. This MA will provide qualified students to service the growing demand for this type of creative practice.</p>\n<p>The course focuses on the applied use of creative activities. It looks at the history of applied arts and how there has been a significant and sustained growth of the arts within a social context over the past three decades within the UK. It provide students with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience to best prepare them for applying the arts and creativity to areas such as third-sector organisations, public health, social welfare, education or criminal justice.</p>\n<p>You will spend time exploring your own ethical frameworks of why and how such creative projects can operate in the social domain.</p>\n<p>The course aims to provide students with the financial and enterprise skills to establish and market themselves as creative practitioners working in social contexts in a sustainably professional manner, including fundraising and finance skills as well as planning and marketing.</p>\n<p>You can take up industry-based learning opportunities where you can put theory into practice.</p>\n<p>You will be supported as part of a growing community of practitioners working in this way.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Practice Research (20 credits): </strong>This module is driven by reflective considerations on the student’s own practice, and explores how to position this work as ‘research.’ It will consist of exploring broader theoretical reflections on the purpose of research, but also case-studies and insights from guest speakers and experts in the field who can speak of their own practical experience of engaging in Applied Arts/Social Practice projects</p>\n<p><strong>Applied Arts: Theories and Histories (20 credits):</strong> Taking a historical perspective as a grounding, this module examines the theoretical justification of Applied Arts, using case studies and past projects. It grounds the students thinking about the types of histories and legacies that can be drawn from to complicate the practices of engagement</p>\n<p><strong>Social Practice: Working With People (20 credits):</strong> This module examines the practical skills required to engage with people, examining concepts such as dialogue, inter-personal skills, group facilitation skills. The most practical of the modules, students get to try out and engage with groups and communities in order to expand their skillsets and experience in working with people. </p>\n<p><strong>Fundraising, Finance and Development (20 credits): </strong>This module will equip students with a critical understanding of the principles and practices of fundraising, development and financial management. The assessments invite students to examine financial support mechanisms (eg, completing a funding application or designing a sponsorship pack) as well as financial literacy exam. This module marks our course as quite unique in this regards. </p>\n<p><strong>Planning and Marketing Cultural Projects (20 credits): </strong>This module will provide students with a critical understanding of the principal skills, techniques and practices necessary to manage and market a cultural project. This modules looks at the practical realities of managing and marketing cultural projects and learning occurs around hypothetical projects that the students plan and market in groups. </p>\n<p><strong>The Only Way is Ethics: Art Representation and Ethics (20 credits): </strong>The module is designed to develop critical and practical skills needed for students to engage with the public in the delivery of cultural projects. It looks at examples from history as well as contemporaneous projects that engage with people at the ethical edges of participation to challenge the student to develop their own ethical frameworks. </p>\n<p>For the MA, you will also complete a final <strong>Practice-Based Dissertation</strong> (60 credits). This consists of enacting a real-world project with a community/context of your choice, or working with the wide-range of QMU partners (eg, Out of The Blue, or Craigmillar Now). It should consist of all elements of social engagement including framing concept, ethical approval, planning, delivery as well as reflecting on practice. This is a fantastic opportunity to develop a portfolio-piece of social practice arts for the first time, or to explore different elements of your own pre-existing practice.</p>\n<p>NB The modules listed are correct at time of posting (October 2022) but are subject to change. In the event that modules change, QMU will seek to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that there is no detrimental impact on students.</p>"
