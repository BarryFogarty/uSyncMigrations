<p>The External Examining system also fulfils the following important functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>it supports the enhancement of taught programmes through identification of good practice and innovation;</li>
<li>it contributes to the information on quality of taught programmes that is publicly available, for example through summary reports on our Quality website.</li>
</ul>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Each programme that leads to an award of the University has one or more External Examiners who provide informed and appropriate external reference points for the comparison of academic standards as well as objective and impartial judgements on a range of matters.</p>
<p>This Handbook has been developed to provide you with up-to-date information about Queen Margaret University, its assessment practices, and the expectations it has of its External Examiners. It also informs you of what you can expect from the University in support of your role as External Examiner, and lists key professional services contacts. We hope that you find it helpful, and would welcome any suggestions you may have concerning how we might update its contents to meet your requirements.</p>

This distinctiveness comes from its key values of enhancement of quality of life and service to the community.</p>\n<p>QMU strives to widen access, both at home and abroad, while at the same time providing a supportive learning environment for all its students. Its graduates are much sought after and employment rates in recent years have been amongst the best in the Scottish and UK sector.</p>\n<p>QMU enjoys an excellent reputation for teaching and research, with key strengths in health care, social sciences, theatre arts, media and communication, food and tourism, and many research staff of international reputation.</p>\n<p>In January 2007, the Privy Council granted full University Title to Queen Margaret University College, making the institution officially ’Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh’.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Purpose and values</span></p>\n<p>We see our purpose as helping to create a better society through education, research and innovation, and by providing a supportive and creative learning environment in which students and staff thrive. In seeking to fulfil this purpose, we are clear and realistic about our strengths, focused on strategic goals, persistent in pursuing opportunities and overcoming barriers, and guided by our values.</p>\n<p>We are a university that is modern in our outlook and facilities but with a maturity built on a long history of serving the community, both locally and globally, and enhancing its wellbeing. We work in a transparent and inclusive manner and hold to core values in everything we do.</p>\n<p>We value environmental sustainability: We recognise the severe threats to our environment and will be a sector leader in response. Our modern campus is a great asset in this work.</p>\n<p>We value the individual and encourage collective support: Each member of staff and each student has their own journey to make and their own contribution to give. Queen Margaret University provides the supportive environment to facilitate this.</p>\n<p>We value intellectual curiosity and the journey of discovery: We design our teaching and research to facilitate this.</p>\n<p>We value ambition: We inspire our students and staff to achieve the best that they can. We pursue opportunities, often in partnership and collaboration with others, to transform and influence society for the better and enhance our visibility within the higher education sector and the wider economy.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>We value excellence: This is embedded in our research, teaching and learning, knowledge exchange and the services we provide. It will be exemplified in the experience of our students, staff and partners.</p>\n<p>We value social justice: In fact, it underpins our world view. We embrace equality, diversity, inclusion, respect, and supporting our communities. Opportunities and access are open to all and on a fair basis.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Strategic Plan 2020-25</span></p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/about-the-university/our-strategic-plan/\" title=\"QMU Strategic Plan for the period 2020-25\">Strategic Plan for the period 2020-25</a> demonstrates how we will contribute to society’s recovery and recalibration following COVID-19. It sets out how we will help create a better society through teaching, learning and innovation. It shows how we will nurture our distinctive person-centred approach to learning, and how we will build on our unique academic portfolio. Promoting creativity, agility, resilience and collaboration, the strategy holds true to the ethos of social justice on which this institution was founded. Our commitment to sustainability will inform all the actions we take.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Campus</span></p>\n<p>In September 2007, the University relocated to a new purpose built campus at Musselburgh, to the south-east of Edinburgh. This brought all departments together in a single site. <a href=\"/location-and-getting-here/\" title=\"QMU Campus Information\">Information about how to get to the campus</a> can be found on our website.</p>\n<p>You should note that the building has swipe card controlled access. When you visit, you will need to report to main reception to receive a temporary visitor card. We encourage sustainable travel, using public transport. However, if you come by car, you will need to arrange a parking permit in advance. In both cases, your host Division should assist you in arranging this. Please contact the School Office for advice. Musselburgh railway station is right beside the campus, and the train takes just six minutes from Edinburgh Waverley, so rail is a good alternative means of travel.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

In coming to a view, the Senate has taken account of the extent to which you:</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>have appropriate levels of expertise and experience in relation to the programme to be examined;</li>\n<li>are capable of performing the range of duties required of the role;</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">have the capacity to command authority in the field and the respect of </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">colleagues;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">have sufficient recent examining experience, preferably having already acted </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">as an External Examiner, or comparable related experience, to indicate competence in assessing students in the specialist area concerned.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Senate will also normally have satisfied itself that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there are no existing links between you and the programme under examination;</li>\n<li>there are no reciprocal External Examining arrangements between your home department and QMU;</li>\n<li>you have not been a student, member of staff, governor, or an Examiner of a related Queen Margaret University programme in the recent past (normally five years);</li>\n<li>you do not hold simultaneously more than the equivalent of two substantial External Examining appointments;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important that you advise the University Secretary if your circumstances change materially and you no longer meet the criteria listed above. In particular, you should notify us of any possible conflicts of interest that arise during your term of office, so we can decide how best to address these, i.e. whether or not they can be resolved.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>If you are unsure whether a change in circumstances constitutes a conflict of interest, you should contact staff of the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement for advice using the generic <a href=\"mailto:Externalexamining@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU External examining address\">External Examining email address.</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Your period of office</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Your offer of appointment will usually confirm that you have been appointed for a period of four years and three months, from September to December of the final year of the programme you are to examine [where the programme follows the standard academic year]. This allows for a three month overlap with your predecessor. Your initial appointment may be extended to a maximum of five years, but you may not be re-appointed until at least five years have elapsed since the end of your last term of office.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Resignation</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>We would ask that, should you need to resign from your position prior to the completion of your contract, you provide a minimum of six months’ notice and that you complete the academic year in order to maintain continuity of assessment. Exceptions to this are possible, with good reason, but need the approval of the Senate. Letters of resignation should be addressed to the Principal of Queen Margaret University.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Resolving disagreements</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>We recognise that, in rare circumstances, either the External Examiner or the Programme Committee may feel that, despite reasonable and timely requests, the other is failing, for no good reason, to comply with the letter or spirit of this Handbook. In these circumstances, the matter of concern may be reported to the Dean of School outwith the normal annual reporting arrangements. The Dean will investigate the matter(s) raised and report back to you and to the Programme Committee as soon as possible. A report will also go to the Senate should any action be required.</p>\n<p>If you have serious concerns about quality and standards that cannot be resolved through referral to the Dean, a confidential report may be submitted directly to the Principal who will investigate the matter and report back to you.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In the event that you are dissatisfied with the response to a confidential report to the<br />Principal, as a last resort, you may ask the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) to investigate using the Scottish Concerns Scheme. The Scheme should only be used to highlight systemic institutional failure and not for one-off cases of ineffective practice.</p>\n<p>There may also be occasions where you determine that a concern is properly a matter for the applicable professional body rather than for QAA.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Payment of your fees and expenses</span></p>\n<p>Your fees and expenses claim should be submitted along with your annual report. Details of the current fee structure are available from the <a href=\"mailto:Externalexamining@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"External examining Email Address\">Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement</a>. The fees claim forms is appended to the External Examining report template. Please note that if you are an Examiner based outside the UK and do not have a UK bank account, alternative arrangements for processing your fees will apply. These will be communicated to you separately.</p>\n<p>Claims in respect of examining fees will not be processed until the University has received a sufficiently detailed External Examining report. The Dean of School has responsibility for determining whether the report provides sufficient detail on the programme for which you are responsible. Whilst there is no prescribed length for the report, we may occasionally seek further information, especially where you have identified areas for development</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Overseas travel</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Note that if you are required to travel overseas for an exam board, QMU will normally be responsible for travel arrangements and will cover all expenses. You will be covered by QMU travel insurance. Please notify us if you have any pre- existing medical conditions that might affect your insurance position. We will then be able to check with the insurer how to proceed.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Termination of your contract</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University reserves the right to terminate the contract of any External Examiner if, in the opinion of the Senate, there has been:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a breach of confidentiality on the part of the Examiner, or</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">the performance of the Examiner, in the context of this Handbook, is judged </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">to be inadequate.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, the following may lead to termination: failure to attend required Boards of Examiners; failure to submit an annual report; and submission of an incomplete report. Decisions to terminate an Examiner’s contract are not taken lightly. In all cases, where termination may be necessary, the Dean will undertake a full investigation before submitting his or her recommendation to the Senate.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Publication of External Examiner details</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University does not currently publish External Examiner names, home institutions or other similar details on its website. However, individual programme teams may include such information in programme materials. Students and other stakeholders may also request information on the name, home institution and particular responsibilities of an Examiner from the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement. We would want to reassure you that such information will only ever be will be released in line with our usual practice and legal obligations under data protection legislation. In such cases, students and other stakeholders will be advised that they must not under any circumstances attempt to make contact with individual Examiners, or seek to influence decisions through such contact or other means.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Please complete all sections of the form on which you are invited to comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that in completing your report, you should not refer directly to individual students by name or matriculation number. You should also not refer directly to individual staff.</strong> We would also ask that you provide as full a written report as possible, even although you may have provided a verbal report at the Board of Examiners. As the reports serve an important enhancement function within the University, we particularly encourage Examiners to identify examples of good practice, which might be disseminated to programme teams.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">What happens to your report?</span></p>\n<p>Once you have submitted your report, its receipt will be acknowledged by staff of the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement. Copies will be circulated to the Programme Leader, Head of Division, Dean of School and School Manager. Copies will also be sent to the Principal and University Secretary.</p>\n<p>A response to your report will be provided by the Programme Leader, who is also responsible for addressing the issues identified in the report. If the matters you have raised are serious, you may expect that they will be addressed immediately. Otherwise, they are dealt with as part of the Annual Monitoring process. In either case, the Programme Leader will provide you with a written response, detailing action taken, or action to be taken.</p>\n<p>The appropriate Programme Committee(s) will, additionally, consider your report at the start of the academic session, with action taken reported by the Programme Leader in the Programme’s Annual Monitoring Report. Programme Committee scrutiny ensures that Class Representatives have input to discussion and decision about actions taken in response to Examiners’ feedback.</p>\n<p>Each response is reviewed and requires approval from the Dean of School or the Dean’s nominee (typically the Head of Division) before being sent to the External Examiner. Whilst is usual for Examiners’ recommendations to be implemented, there may be occasions where, after due consideration, it is decided to pursue an alternative course of action. In such cases, a full explanation of the reasons for not implementing the recommendation(s) will be provided.</p>\n<p>Reports and responses to Examiners are normally provided in full to all students on the Programme for which you are responsible through the Virtual Learning Environment. The only exception to this would be where there is content that needs to be redacted, for example because an individual student or staff member is identifiable from the content.</p>\n<p>Your report also contributes to the production of an annual institutional report on External Examiner reports. This is considered by the Student Experience Committee, which has responsibility for ensuring that issues with institutional implications are addressed or remitted to other committees as appropriate.</p>\n<p>The annual report includes a summary of examples of good practice in learning, teaching, and assessment identified by Examiners. This allows for institutional consideration of identified examples with the potential to impact on the student experience.</p>\n<p>The annual report, or sections thereof, is disseminated by staff of the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement to the following: QMU staff; QMU students; External Examiners.</p>\n<p>We recognise that our External Examiners give important feedback on the operation of our academic portfolio, and timely receipt of reports allows us to take early action to address any issues raised. For this reason, it is vital that you meet the deadline for submission of reports and forms, i.e.no later than 30 September, <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">and preferably within three weeks of the relevant meeting of the Board of Examiners. For programmes with a standard calendar this allows the team to consider the report and take action before the start of the next academic year.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
