<p>About you</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I left school at the age of 16 with the intention of working for a year and then returning to further education. I found an opportunity to join a ‘School Leaver Programme’ at energy company SSE – and I’m still there 14 years later! I initially worked in IT before moving into the company’s Corporate Communications function, where I’ve undertaken a number of digitally-focused jobs, before working my way into the role of Digital Communications Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to study a Graduate Apprenticeship (GA) at QMU, and what attracted you to the course?</strong></p>
<p>I was first made aware of the programme by a colleague. Revisiting further education was always in my plan. The Graduate Apprenticeship opportunity – combined with the fresh perspective I’ve got on things thanks to coronavirus – encouraged me to go for it.</p>
<p>The Course</p>
<p><strong>What have you most enjoyed about your course?</strong></p>
<p>The feeling of learning and doing something good is great. In terms of highlights, passing all four assignments in the first semester was a real high point and started to convince me that I could do well with the course.</p>
<p><strong>Has there been a particular course activity you found especially interesting? How have your lecturers supported your learning?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoyed working as part of a team in the Group Presentation assignment for the ‘Business in Society’ module. It gave me an excellent opportunity to collaborate and work in a different way – I think this was reflected in the end product, with my group doing especially well. The lecturers do a remarkable job and are incredibly helpful, despite the difficulty associated with the entire course taking place at a distance (for now!)</p>
<p><strong>What have been some of your challenges with the course and university life? How have you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p>Learning entirely at a distance has been challenging. The first day was on-campus – since then, I haven’t been able to get to QMU or speak with my classmates and lecturers. That has been the biggest challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</strong></p>
<p>Do it! I’ve really enjoyed it, and I’m learning loads – QMU works closely with my employer to ensure that the coursework is relevant, so everything I’m learning can almost all be directly applied to my day-to-day working life. </p>
<p>Enhancing student learning and personal development</p>
<p><strong>How has the GA helped you in the workplace in terms of developing a career path? </strong></p>
<p>I’m only one year into the four-year course – but I’ve already learned a lot about the successful running of a big business – this will be critical as I aim to progress my career.</p>
<p><strong>What University services have you used to support you through your university journey and how have they helped you?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve sought the support of more experienced learners at QMU through the PALS (Peer Assisted Learning Sessions) initiative that is in place – this help has been invaluable. They are all ahead of me in the learning journey and can call upon their experience to help answer any questions I’ve had.</p>
<p>Life as a Student at QMU</p>
<p><strong>What’s your ‘top tip’ for making the most of being a student on a GA programme?</strong></p>
<p>Ask questions. A lot of information is thrown at you very quickly – take time to make sure you understand everything – it’s a cliché, but there are no wrong questions.</p>
<p><strong>What has been the most valuable lesson that you’ve learned at university?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something, you need to work for it! The assignments that I have undertaken so far have challenged me. They require a lot of hard work and studying – but the feeling when you pass is well worth it.</p>
<p>And finally...</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans after graduation? Tell us about your ambitions and where you see yourself in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Graduation feels quite far in the distance right now, but I hope to graduate with a strong degree and feel more equipped to seek progression in my career as a corporate communicator at SSE. </p>
