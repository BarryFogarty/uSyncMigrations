The project is aimed at pupils interested in studying Nursing or any of the Allied Health Professions we offer here at QMU.</p>\n<p>These degrees require more than just good exam results from school. As part of your application you are required to submit a personal statement and for these subjects we are looking for you to have a good level of knowledge about the role of the health professional in the NHS, and a good level of work experience and volunteering in a related field.</p>\n<p>This programme was put together in response to the Covid-19 restrictions that will have affected many work experience placements planned by prospective students.</p>\n<p>This programme aims to provide you with experience of studying these subjects at university and gives you an opportunity to gain more insight into the subject of choice as well as providing you with experience to reflect on as part of your personal statement.</p>\n<p>We will also support you with impartial advice and guidance on your application to university.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that participation does not come with any guarantee of an offer to a course at QMU or any other university, but would support your application in an alternative way. The Admissions team here at QMU would view completion of the programme and all its associated elements favourably.</p>"
