The credit rating process differs from validation in that it does not lead to the award of credit or a qualification from the University.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong> When a student passes a module they are awarded academic credit proportionate to the size of the module.

A signed Memorandum is required for each collaborative arrangement approved by the University.</p>\n<p><strong>Microcredential</strong> See Short Programme</p>\n<p><strong>Moderation</strong> is the process of confirming the consistency of the marks and feedback provided by the original marker(s). See the Assessment Regulations for detailed advice on the distinction between moderation and double marking.</p>\n<p><strong>Module</strong> is a unit of study in a defined area of knowledge, skills and/or understanding. Modules may be self-contained and stand alone, or may form part of a larger academic programme. A named <strong>module co-ordinator</strong> is responsible for arranging the delivery and assessment of the module. Each module must have a <strong>module descriptor</strong>. A standard presentation format is used, requiring staff to specify the level, size, learning outcomes and content.</p>\n<p><strong>Module Change</strong> denotes a modification to existing module descriptors including changes to the module title, to the content of individual modules, teaching practices and other modes of delivery, and the nature of assessments.</p>"

Risks relating to financial, legal and personal safety matters are considered, as well as those relating to academic quality. Once risks have been identified, actions to reduce or mitigate the risk must be proposed. Risk assessments are conducted for new partnerships and reported to the Portfolio Development Group as part of the process for approving new partners and programmes. Following this, risk assessments are updated annually. This allows the University to intervene proactively if risks increase or are not satisfactorily controlled.</p>"
