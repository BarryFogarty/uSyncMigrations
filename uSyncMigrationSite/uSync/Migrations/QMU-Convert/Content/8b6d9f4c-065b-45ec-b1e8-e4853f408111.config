      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>Already having 30 years' experience working in the electric power industry in multiple different roles, Ioannis Sideris decided it was time to challenge himself with a new adventure. </span> </p>
<p><span>Knowing that marketing is arguably one of the most important functions for a business, Ioannis applied to the <a href="/about-the-university/quality/programme-specifications/ba-hons-marketing-management-metropolitan-college/">BA (Hons) Marketing Management</a> course at Metropolitan College in his hometown of Athens, delivered in partnership with Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh in Scotland. </span> </p>
<p><span>Marketing was already a subject Ioannis had a keen interest in, but little experience. He said: “I have always enjoyed trying out new roles and sectors – I’ve never been able to sit still and thankfully, in the industry I work in, there are so many opportunities and areas in which to progress your career. One thing is for sure, I will never get bored!</span> </p>
<p><span>“When I found out that the company I was working for at the time had its own marketing department, it seemed like the perfect time to broaden my skillset even further, especially as marketing was a sector that</span><span> I had always been enthusiastic about.</span> </p>
<p><span>“I loved the course that I studied at Metropolitan College. I really enjoyed the professors’ teaching style which I believe is synonymous with the UK and one that is internationally renowned. They u</span><span>sed a lot of different mediums including the use of video – something I had never really experienced in my earlier educa</span><span>tion.</span> </p>
<p><span>“We also received first-hand accounts from experts with years of experience in the industry which were simply invaluable.</span> </p>
<p><span>“And of course</span><span>, the degree that I was studying for would hold real prestige and one that very few of my fellow colleagues would have. This certainly kept me motivated as I knew it would make a real impact to my CV and help to differentiate me from others, allowing me to stand out to employers.”</span> </p>
<p><span>Ioannis excelled while studyi</span><span>ng for his BA (Hons) Marketing Management degree and, due to his efforts, was one </span><span>of the highest performing students on the course that year. QMU rewarded Ioannis’ academic excellence with an award certificate. This accolade, which recognised his outstanding performance throughout the course, along with his internationally recognised degree, will support his progression to the exciting marketing role he so desires.</span> </p>
<p><span>When asked what his top tips would be for making the most of the student experience at university, Ioannis mentioned that</span><span> patience, passion and persistence were key in order to reach your full potential. </span> </p>
<p><span>Now graduated from Metropolitan College, Ioannis hopes to transition into a marketing position at his current place of work, using the skills he has learned in the importance of customer satisfaction, digital marketing trends and brand management analysis.</span> </p>]]></Value>
