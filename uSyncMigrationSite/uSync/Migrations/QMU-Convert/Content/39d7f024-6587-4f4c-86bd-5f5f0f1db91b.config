      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The strategy has been developed through consultation with representatives from students and graduates, employers, programme teams and Student Services, all of whom share responsibility for implementation. The strategy is built on solutions anchored in best practice from across the University, and from other higher education institutions as well as academia and industry. It represents an agreement on the focus and priorities of the Careers and Employability team, programme teams and our external partners over the period 2021-2026. It has been developed against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and includes projects which will support students to navigate uncertain labour markets and an anticipated economic downturn, and to maximise the opportunities presented by changing working practices across all industries and sectors</p>
<p>In this document, the stakeholders of the strategy are identified, and factors influencing the development of the strategy are laid out, along with a number of principles that provide context for the aims and objectives that form the strategy. A high-level implementation plan outlines the actions required to achieve the objectives, and the people or departments who are responsible for implementation. Methods of tracking progress against the implementation plan, and the aims and objectives, are also included.</p>]]></Value>

      "content": "<p>The following groups will benefit from the objectives set out in this strategy and are defined as stakeholders.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Students:</strong> The Employability Strategy (ES) outlines the approach through which students will be supported to develop the University’s Graduate Attributes throughout their studies, which will contribute to their employability and success as they leave university. Whilst the strategy aims to increase graduate level employment in support of graduate employment targets, students will be supported to make informed choices for their futures, which may include employment, entrepreneurial or voluntary activities, graduating from University ready for a successful life, and reaching their potential. The implementation of the strategy is intended to support undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students on taught and research based courses.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Graduates: </strong>The ES demonstrates the University’s ongoing commitment to the employability of its graduates throughout their lives.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Students’ Union:</strong> The ES gives an aim and a set of objectives against which the University can be measured, giving focus to the partnership between the University and Students’ Union (SU). It promotes the work of the SU, linking employability to, and promoting participation in, sports, societies and the SU.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Programme Teams:</strong> The ES assists in developing and embedding transferable skills within and across the full curricula, building upon excellent examples, such as the Creative Entrepreneurship module, and extending practice. It will provide a further mechanism for the sharing of practice and for the inclusion of careers education with programme design. It will provide focus for conversations between Personal Academic Tutors and students, creating a framework for productive employability focused conversations.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Careers and Employability Team: </strong>The ES enhances the work of the team, raising its profile and influence across the University and beyond. It provides an agreed framework for careers activity, ensuring that the work of the team fully supports the strategic focus of the institution. It provides a consistency of approach across programmes and schools. It will facilitate communication with collaborative partners (e.g. programme teams) and ensure best possible use of the Careers and Employability team resources, skills and support. It provides a point of reference for the management of Careers and Employability. It will act as an institutional tool through which to share and discuss issues related to employability within Higher Education.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Professional Services:</strong> The ES provides the opportunity for Professional Services staff to benefit from the skills, knowledge and expertise of our students. It will also provide an opportunity for staff development, through mentoring and developing students during their internships and other paid work within Professional Services.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>The University:</strong> The ES will enhance the University’s reputation for being an institution of choice for students seeking to develop their employability, and will support the University’s strategic aims of becoming the top modern university in Scotland for employment and student satisfaction.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Local Communities:</strong> The promotion of volunteering as a method to improve employability is highlighted within the ES, and will provide valuable resources for community groups and charities.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Employers: </strong>The ES supports the development of skills and attributes in our graduates, enabling them to contribute effectively to their employers and professions.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Partner Institutions</strong>: The ES provides an overview of the approach to employability taken by partner institutions so that best practice can be shared for the benefit of students.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Other Institutions:</strong> The ES enhances the sharing of employability practice with other institutions assisting the improvement of practice across the sector.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Scottish Government:</strong> The ES provides focus and drive to implement the Scottish Government’s employability agenda within Queen Margaret University. It will link in with the principles of the Commission for Developing Scotland’s Young Workforce.</p>"

      "title": "Principles of the Strategy",
      "content": "<p>The Employability Strategy builds on good practice currently in place, and seeks to enhance and expand the support offered to students by considering the unique environment at Queen Margaret University. Evidence for the effectiveness of new initiatives included in the strategy has come from published research, observation of effective practice at other universities and in response to rapidly changing labour market conditions. The following principles are key to contextualising the objectives outlined in this strategy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">A Shared Understanding of Career Development</span></p>\n<p>In order for students, graduates, careers professionals and programme teams to work together to maximise employability outcomes for students and graduates, a shared understanding of career development is required. Developing a careers education curriculum or framework through which career management skills are defined, and career development stages are identified, would enable visibility across the University. Careers and Employability support and activity, as well as employability modules and opportunities within programmes would be aligned with the framework, with agreed content and quality standards.</p>\n<p>Students will be able to assess their knowledge of and confidence in careers education subjects at matriculation, in a process known as careers registration, used in many universities including at the University of the West of Scotland, Heriot Watt University and the University of Strathclyde.</p>\n<p>Visibility of a structured framework of careers education will enable students to understand what they will learn throughout their studies, and will promote autonomy and reflection on skills and strengths. A range of resources, learning opportunities and experiences will be signposted through the framework so that students can recognise the impact of extra and co-curricular activities, employer engagement and career learning. Students will be empowered to curate their own careers education throughout their time at university and after graduation. It is expected that this process will lead to earlier engagement with Careers and Employability Advisers, and employers, and earlier independent career planning which may lead to improved outcomes for students and graduates. Frameworks such as the<a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/careers/students/undergraduates/careers-compass/compass-intro\" title=\"Careers Compass  developed by the University of Edinburgh\"> Careers Compass developed by the University of Edinburgh</a> illustrate the possibilities presented.</p>\n<p>The implementation plan for the Employability Strategy sets out a research project which will result in the development of a proposal for the design of a framework or curriculum, during which best practice across higher education will be examined along with published research.</p>\n<p>For context, a model developed or selected at Queen Margaret University could incorporate an accepted model such as the DOTS model developed by Law and Watts (1977), the Career Management Skills Framework developed by Skills Development Scotland (2012) or the Careers Framework developed by the Career Development Institute (2020). A development proposal is likely to outline either in-house development of a framework and the enhancement and alignment of existing resources, or adoption of a framework developed externally. The proposal is also likely to set out requirements for funding for a platform through which students and graduates can map their progress against the framework, and can access technologically driven resources, activities, events and experiences aligned to each stage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">A Shared Terminology for Work-Based Learning</span></p>\n<p>The following definitions are provided to ensure shared terms of reference for the purposes of defining the aims and objectives of the strategy. The definitions do not seek to alter terminology used by individual programmes, schools or professional bodies where the following activities may be described in other ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement </strong>– A compulsory or optional credit bearing opportunity for a student to work in a professional environment related to their course of study. Placements usually take place during term time and are likely to include an assessment of a student’s performance. Placements can be arranged by the University or a student may secure a placement independently.</p>\n<p><strong>Internship</strong> – An optional work experience opportunity, without an assessment element or earned credits, which usually takes place in university holidays, before a course starts or after graduation. Internships can be any length of time, and whilst unpaid internships are offered, the University commits so only promoting paid internships to students and graduates to ensure equity of access. Internship opportunities may be facilitated by the university,through programme such as the Santander Internship Fund and the Saltire Scholarship Programme, or secured by a student independently.</p>\n<p><strong>Work-Based Learning</strong> – An umbrella term, referring to a range of activities which a student may undertake whilst studying and throughout their lives. These may include experiences which form part of a programme such as placements, challenge based assignments addressing realistic or current industry scenarios, visits from employers and visits to workplaces alongside other activities. Work-based learning may also refer to extra circular activities including attending careers fairs, internships, work experience or work shadowing, having a mentor, and other work based career research.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Data Driven Approach</span></p>\n<p>By collecting and analysing quantitative and qualitative data about our students and graduates, their engagement with Careers and Employability services and their career journeys, we will be able to adapt and grow the services provided to ensure they are fit for purpose and respond to changing requirements, market conditions and technological developments. This approach will also enable a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of factors including gender, ethnicity, disability status or socioeconomic background on the careers of graduates. Data sources are likely to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patterns in attendance of and subjects covered in 1:1 and group guidance sessions from the Student Central system.</li>\n<li>Graduate Outcomes data</li>\n<li>Evaluation of Careers and Employability services by students, graduates, programme teams and external partners</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Equality, Diversity and Inclusion</span></p>\n<p>The projects and programmes detailed in the strategy allow for targeted and enhanced support for students and graduates who face barriers relating to protected characteristics, those who are care experienced, and those from the most deprived postcode areas. A commitment to promoting equality and diversity is shared by those responsible for implementation. In addition, the activities described will enable students and graduates to becoming culturally aware and equipped to join a global workforce.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Regular Strategy Reviews to Reflect Changing Labour Market Conditions</span></p>\n<p>Whilst this strategy presents an outline of the aims, objectives and required actions for the next five years, we have seen rapid and transformative changes to labour markets a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK’s departure from the European Union, and a range of technological developments. In order to ensure that this strategy continues to be fit for purpose, the implementation plan, when agreed, will be subject to regular re-evaluation through annual review.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Focus on Graduate Job and Internship Opportunities</span></p>\n<p>In order to maximise the number of students who go on to find fulfilling graduate level employment over the next five years, a period during which the effects of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to impact the graduate labour market, the University should consider reviewing the approach taken to creating, identifying and promoting graduate level jobs, placement and internships. A dedicated function with additional responsibility for securing and managing government and private funding for employment support programmes would increase options available for students.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Collaborative Working</span></p>\n<p>The implementation of this strategy represents a refreshed approach to ensuring that staff and students across the University work together to share best practice, solve problems and address challenges in order to embed careers education within programmes.  A partnership between programme teams and Careers and Employability will enable a full leveraging of relationships with external partners, sharing opportunities such as jobs and events with students and will ensure that students are aware of the careers support that is available for them.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Employability is more than Graduate Employment</span></p>\n<p>Whilst a key measure of the success of this strategy is the number of students who are in positive destination when they complete the graduate outcomes survey, it should not be forgotten that career and life success for individuals and for society can be defined in a myriad of ways.  This strategy should enable students to develop the QMU Graduate Attributes, and career management skills which enable informed proactive decision making and lead to happy lives and a positive impact on society.</p>"
