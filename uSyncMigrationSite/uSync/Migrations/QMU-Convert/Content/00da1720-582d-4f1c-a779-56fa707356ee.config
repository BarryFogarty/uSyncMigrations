      <Value><![CDATA[QMU served as the ideal venue for our Production company to film in recently. With a number of large spaces on offer, we were spoilt for choice when choosing where to film for our client. The facilities were clean, well maintained and the service we received from the Events team was exceptional. We will definitely be back!]]></Value>
