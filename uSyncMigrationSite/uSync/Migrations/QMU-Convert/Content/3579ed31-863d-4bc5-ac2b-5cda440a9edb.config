    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">1.0 Foreword</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Social justice is central to the values of Queen Margaret University. As such, we must have the highest regard for the health and safety of our community.</p>
<p>As Principal and Vice-Chancellor, I bear ultimate responsibility for the health and safety of all those affected by the undertakings of the University. I take that responsibility very seriously.  Along with the rest of the Senior Leadership Team, I am committed to providing a stimulating, safe and supportive environment.</p>
<p>In this document, you will find our Health and Safety Statement of Policy and our Health and Safety Policy itself. Producing this policy is a legal requirement under the provisions of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. But the policy is only a starting point, of course. At Queen Margaret University, we will continually strive to achieve the highest practical standard rather than rely on the legal minimum. </p>
<p>This policy explains the structure, methodology and responsibilities associated with health and safety at the University, putting an expectation on all to actively pursue increasingly higher health and safety management standards, ensuring localised safety throughout the University.</p>
<p>  Our Health and Safety Policy is supplemented by individual procedures covering various topics. A link to these guidance documents can be found in Appendix 1. Everyone must ensure they are aware of the safety precautions appropriate to the area in which they work.</p>
<p>All of us in the Queen Margaret University community have a responsibility to help ensure that we foster a positive culture of health and safety. As part of this, we are all required to take reasonable care of our own safety, and the safety of others who may be affected by our actions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Principal and Vice-Chancellor, Sir Paul Grice.</p>
<p>December 2022.</p>]]></Value>
