<p><span class="lead">Lulea University of Technology, Sweden</span></p>
<p>Not many people would think of Sweden as their first choice for an Erasmus Student Exchange, especially in the far North of Sweden, at Luleå University of Technology (LTU). However, it is such an amazing place. The students and staff are so friendly, and everyone speaks English! If you are an outdoor person, then seriously think about Luleå. It is a place of contrasts, from +28c in Summer, to -30c in Winter; from Swimming in beautiful lagoons in the Summer, to Ice skating in the same places in the Winter; from the Midnight Sun to the Northern Lights – it is amazing. LTU has a fantastic support structure for all students, with a section dedicated to looking after both International and European students. The staff, both academic and administrative, are well geared to look after everyone, and they go out of their way to make everyone feel welcome – look out for the Swedish hugs!</p>
<p>LTU changed my whole life, not just academically, but personally as well. Much like other Erasmus students will testify, the Erasmus programme is life changing. I found Sweden to be life changing; it is an amazing country, please give it some serious thought. I have now finished my BSc, and am continuing with an MSc at QMU thanks to LTU and Erasmus – who knows where that will lead to. It might be a cliche, but the Erasmus Student Exchange programme is a once in a life time chance – take it!</p>]]></Value>
