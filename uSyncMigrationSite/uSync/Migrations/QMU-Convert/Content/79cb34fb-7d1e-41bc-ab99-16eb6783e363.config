<p><img src="?width=500&amp;height=280.2734375" alt="Jared's exchange" width="500" height="280.2734375" data-udi="umb://media/9c0ad564bdca4145b23a4ee605afde85" /></p>
<p>I picked Kempten in Germany as it was near to home if I ever needed to come back to the UK such as a family members Birthday in my case. Kempten is well served by the rail network with Deutsche Bahn offering a very good rail service to Munich, Memmingen and Ulm (Change here for services to Stuttgart). Munich and Memmingen also offer direct flights to Edinburgh with both Ryanair and easyJet. It is because of how well served Kempten was and how easy it was for me to fly home that helped to sell me on studying in Germany. When I was in classes, I was able to communicate with the professors and lecturers who took my classes and have a dialect with them. They spoke fluent English, although the accents took some getting use to. I found the international business courses enlightening and my German A1 course helpful in gaining a basic understanding of the German Language.</p>

<p>There were issues whilst abroad, but I was able to overcome them and learn from them, issues such as cultural differences, language barriers and people’s personalities but these experiences were all a blessing in disguise. There is one issue that was a hinderance on myself and that was Brexit, this issue made cost of travelling to München or Prague and any other travel had to be planned out meticulously. If you want to travel and see around Europe, some great advice would be book as soon as possible, train travel in most countries is owned by the government and is just as pricey as travelling here in the UK. Flights are a little better depending on where you travel too or whom you travel with, however the most cost-effective way to travel around the continent is the coach service, whilst this is the longest option it is significantly cheaper and must be considered.</p>

<p>The surrounding area in Kempten, as I’ve mentioned is an absolute beautiful marvel, the Neuschwanstein Castle helps to personify these landscapes and is well worth the visit. I can not express into the words the scenery for me, I found it complete unimaginable as was the experience to go and study abroad. I met some incredible people, see parts of a country that might be overlooked by the average tourist. The skills I’ve made such as language and the skills that I’ve improved such as understanding will help me not just through university but throughout all my aspects of life as they can help me to focus on the issues that will matter to myself. This whole experience I will be forever grateful for.</p>
