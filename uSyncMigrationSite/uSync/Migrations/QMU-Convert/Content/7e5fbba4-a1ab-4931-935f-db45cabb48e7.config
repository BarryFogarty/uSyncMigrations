<p>He graduated from Queen Margaret University in 2013 with a BA (Hons) Drama and Performance.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>What are your most memorable experiences of being a QMU student?</strong></span></p>
<p>Some of my most memorable moments are the extra-curricular activities in coordination with the QMU Students' Union.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Having the opportunity to partake in a society was one of the greatest experiences. To this day, I&#x27;m still in touch with people I met through those societies." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>Another strong memory I have from my time at QMU was the friendly and small community vibe you get there. The campus is not a huge campus so you never get lost in the crowd, you're definitely more than just a number! Knowing everyone on first name basis from the receptionists to security, the librarians to the catering staff was great and made you feel part of the bigger QMU family.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Tell us more about your career path since leaving QMU.</strong></span></p>
<p>After graduation, I ended up staying on as part of the QMUSU! I did a two-year term as Student Vice-President and had an amazing time trying to enhance and help the student experience.</p>
<p>Following on from that, I worked at a local Drug and Alcohol rehabilitation charity as their Events and Sponsorships Manager.</p>
<p>After my contract with the charity ended, I was at a loss of what to do next.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="I decided to combine my love of travel with those skills I learned from my Drama and Performance course and became a holiday rep! 
What started off as a summer season role has turned into a fulfilling 6 year career. " source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>Not only have I had the opportunity to work in beautiful destinations such as Cyprus, Cape Verde and Mexico, but to also progress my career working in a variety of different roles. I'm now Service Delivery Team Manager and responsible for a large group of hotels.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Tell us more about what your role as Service Delivery Team Manager at TUI involves?</strong></span></p>
<p>I'm currently working in Mexico as a Service Delivery Team Manager. We have ambitious targets that cover sales, but most importantly, what TUI is known for, service.</p>
<p>I work with my own team and the senior management hotelier teams across an area that encompasses the Riviera Maya in Mexico, to ensure that we create experiences of a lifetime for our guests.</p>
<p>Alongside this, many opportunities and projects have cropped up, and I'm also working with a small boutique hotel in Mexico as part of the Enpact Tourism Recovery Programme in cooperation with the TUI Care Foundation. I help mentor and train this hospitality business to prepare it for growth;  financially, operationally and increasing its exposure moving forward.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>What advice would you give to students and new graduates starting out?</strong></span></p>
<p>Don't focus too much about getting that great sounding, big senior job right at the start.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Wait and bide your time for the right opportunity, once you&#x27;ve found something you love doing, it will be easy to develop and hone your skills to become successful at what you do." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>I left QMU wanting to direct performances; never in a million years did I think I would be in the Travel and Tourism sector and loving what I do every day.</p>
<p>It really is about keeping your cool - it’s a marathon not a race!</p>]]></Value>
