<p><span class="lead"><strong>Applying online</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You will find all our degree programmes listed on our <a data-id="4549" href="/{localLink:umb://document/459150c020bb424c89d61a42547ec50d}" title="Course A-Z">course information pages</a>. To apply for your chosen programme, click on the “Apply for this Course” button which appears top right on each course page.</span></p>
<p><span>Each programme will list the entry requirements, available awards, study modes and available start dates.</span></p>
<p><span>Select your programme and preferred start date and begin your application.</span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Application form</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On our application form please input your basic details. Be careful spelling your email address as this is how we will contact you about your application in future.</span></p>
<p><span>As part of your application on the form, you will need to write a personal statement specific to the course that you are applying. This is your chance to sell yourself through highlighting your experience, suitability and motivators for wanting to join this course at QMU.</span></p>
<p><span>You will have the chance to upload supporting documents as part of your application. This is an important part of the admissions process and without seeing supporting documents, tutors will not have enough information to make a decision on your application.</span></p>
<p><span>The form allows you to save your application should you wish to complete it later.</span></p>
<p><span>Once complete you can submit your application to us and you will receive an automatic acknowledgement email confirming receipt of your application. You will also receive a QMU applicant ID number which you should keep a note of and quote in any correspondence to QMU.</span></p>
<p><span>Find your perfect course using our <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/459150c020bb424c89d61a42547ec50d}?tab=postgraduate" title="Course A-Z" data-anchor="?tab=postgraduate"><span class="blue-btn">Course A-Z list</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively if you know which course you'd like to apply for, you can apply using our <a href="https://u.qmu.ac.uk/live/sits.urd/run/siw_ipp_lgn.login?process=siw_ipp_app_crs" title="Apply now" data-anchor="?process=siw_ipp_app_crs"><span class="blue-btn"> online application form</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Supporting documents</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As part of your application you will need to submit to us:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A copy of your degree certificate</span></li>
<li><span>A copy of your academic transcripts</span></li>
<li><span>One or two letters of reference, depending on the course. If you finished your degree within the last three years, we ask for an academic reference. References must be signed, dated and written on letter headed paper or sent directly from a professional email account. <a href="/study-here/how-to-apply/how-to-provide-references/">Find out more about references</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If your documents are in any language other than English then they will need to be accompanied by a formal certified translation into English, by either the awarding institution or a sworn translator.</span></p>
<p>Students whose first language is not English are required to provide us with proof of their English language ability. More information on how to do this can be found on our<a data-id="6666" href="/{localLink:umb://document/faece53361e54baabf8a71adc02b4785}" title="English Language Requirements"> English language requirements page</a>.</p>
<p><span>If you have not yet graduated and don’t have your degree certificate, this can be sent to us at a later date.</span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Interviews</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Some of our courses require interviews as part of the selection process. If your course requires an interview it will be noted on the course page and if successfully chosen we will contact you by email with further instructions and information. Where applicants are unable to attend an interview on campus, it may be possible to arrange a telephone or skype interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Deadlines</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A number of our most popular courses have set a closing deadline for applications. Where a deadline has been set this will be detailed on the individual course page.</span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Decisions</strong></span></p>
<p>You should expect a decision on your application within four weeks of submitting a fully completed application with supporting documents. Where programmes have set closing dates with an equal consideration deadline, decisions will be notified within four weeks of the closing date.</p>]]></Value>
