      <Value><![CDATA[<p class="txtMainBlack">This exhibition celebrates the career journeys of a selection of our women researchers. The women in the photographs represent just a small selection of the fantastic women researchers who work across different disciplines at various levels across QMU.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Queen Margaret University (QMU) is committed to creating and celebrating a positive, inclusive research environment based on respect for individuals’ differences, in which students and staff are actively encouraged to reach their full potential. Our objective is to continue to develop as an institution that understands, appreciates and values the diversity of each individual, makes people feel valued and able to participate and reach their full potential.</strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“Since our inception in 1875 we have had a long history of achievement in championing and progressing the role of women. Our founders Christian Guthrie Wright and Louisa Stevenson, were key influencers in the UK-wide mid Victorian ‘Women’s Movement’, which was a campaign for better education and improved career opportunities for females. </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“Today we are proud to be one of the first UK and European institutions to be awarded and to retain the HR Excellence Award, bestowed by the European Commission, recognising a university’s commitment to improving the working conditions and career development of its research staff through the Concordat for Research Careers. </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“We are also pleased to be actively involved in a number of sector initiatives to promote and embed good practice in Equality and Diversity in Research Careers including the Vitae Every Researcher Counts initiative. The School of Health Sciences’ commitment to addressing gender inequalities in science and to improving career progression for female academics has been recognized by Athena SWAN and we will continue to champion gender equality initiatives beyond the conventional STEM domain to include initiatives such as Aurora. </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“We hope this exhibition will inspire others both within QMU and beyond.”</em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Professor Petra Wend PhD FRSA FRSE </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Principal and Vice-Chancellor, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh</strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">In 2013, Queen Margaret University received the Bronze Athena SWAN Award in light of its commitment to assisting the recruitment and retention of women in science, engineering and technology (SET).</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The Athena SWAN Charter is a recognition scheme for UK universities and their science, engineering and technology (SET) departments. It aims to assist the recruitment, retention and progression of women in SET.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Queen Margaret University is committed to the principles of the Charter and values equality and diversity across its workforce. To support these principles and to promote the role of women in SET, the University has undertaken an internal self-assessment process and has been successful in gaining a Bronze SWAN Award. The University sees membership of the Charter, with its bronze, silver and gold SWAN recognition awards, as working towards sustaining equitable working environments enabling QMU to identify itself as an employer of choice, not only to its staff, but to students, stakeholders, research councils and industry.</p>]]></Value>
