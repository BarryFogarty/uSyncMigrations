      "content": "<p>Over the past three decades within the UK, there has been a significant and sustained growth of the arts within a social context. Indeed, the current Cultural Strategy in Scotland looks at embedding artistic and creative practices across numerous sectors, inviting artists, theatre makers, musicians and all creative practitioners to be productive within industry, business, education and social settings.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the arts are becoming more important within health and wellbeing contexts and the national report ‘Creative Health: Arts for Health and Wellbeing’ calls for artists to play a vital role in the social health and well-being of the population to the extent that GPs in England can prescribe artistic activities in order to tackle social issues such as obesity, loneliness and depression. This PgCert will introduce students to the main concepts that this growing sector is wrestling with and provide a strong base to build and develop your career as a creative practitioner working alongside communities.</p>\n<p>You will complete three modules on this block-taught PgCert, touching on the most theoretical and practical elements, including an analysis of the ethics of working within communities, practical skills of engaging with groups as well as Fundraising and finance. This provide students with a good base of knowledge, skills and experience to best prepare them for applying the arts and creativity to areas such as third-sector organisations – ie public health, social welfare, or education.</p>"
