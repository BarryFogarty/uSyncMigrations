      <Value><![CDATA[<p>How would you recommend that students make the most of their university experience? </p>
<p>University is a great platform that supports students through their course and provides them with ample time to build the life they want outside of the lecture halls. The best advice I can give is that if there is something that you want to do but have been afraid of failing at it, now is a great time to try to do that thing you have been planning for months but never followed through on! </p>
<p>What are your top tips for keeping a healthy body and mind? </p>
<p>Make sure that you have a good sleep schedule! Ensure that you work on your time management as it is important and will help provide structure, especially during the first few years where you are still finding out what works for you. Limit your screen time and take a step outside and make the most of the campus around you, or if you are not on campus, go to your local park or beach to step away. We all spend our lives on our screens, but it's important to know what is happening around us. </p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Why did you choose QMU? </p>
<p>I picked Queen Margaret University because of the opportunities presented to me that could help develop my career in the way that I wanted. The campus is also situated in an ideal position where you can 'escape to the countryside' and get to Edinburgh city centre within minutes, which was ideal for me. <br /><br />Over the past few years, I have been able to speak with my lecturers and staff across the University about what I wanted to do moving forward, which really helped me get where I am today. </p>
<p>What are some of the best things you have done since becoming at student at QMU? </p>
<p>The best thing that I have done during my time at Queen Margaret University was creating an Esports society within the Student's Union (QMUSU). Not only has the process been rewarding, but I have been able to provide a safe space for people with similar interests in video games and make some fantastic friends along the way!</p>
<p>From competing in national competitions against universities across the UK with my friends to helping design and produce merchandise that you can see others wearing on campus, getting involved with a society is something I would encourage all students to do. And if you can't find what you're looking for, create your own as there will be others that will share your hobbies and interests!</p>]]></Value>
