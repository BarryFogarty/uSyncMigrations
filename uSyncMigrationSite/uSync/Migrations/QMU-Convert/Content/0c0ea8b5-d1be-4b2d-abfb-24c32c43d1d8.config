<p>National Cycle Route 1 runs from Waverley Station to the campus. There are also many quiet roads in the Musselburgh area which would allow for safe cycling. <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.opencyclemap.org/" target="_blank" title="Open Cycle Map showing the UK's cycle routes">These can be seen online.</a> There is plenty of <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.scotrail.co.uk/plan-your-journey/cycling/bikes-trains" target="_blank" title="Scotrail web page for bringing cycles on trains">space for bikes on all the trains</a> calling at both Newcraighall and Musselburgh.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Central Musselburgh - QMU by foot: <span class="txtMainBlack">20 mins </span></strong></span><br />Start at Eskside West- this is the road that runs parallel to the River Esk. Walk up this road towards Stoneybank- i.e. not toward the coast. Continue onto Eskview Terrace. You will notice a few newsagents and a take away on your right. Immediately after these shops, take the first right onto Stoneybank Terrace (which will become Whitehill Farm Road) and continue on this road until you arrive at QMU (it's just after the train station).</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Fort Kinnaird - QMU: 20 mins</strong></span> <br />Follow the A6095 Newcraighall Road from Fort Kinnaird, passing B&amp;M as you leave the shopping park. Continue to walk past the A1 junction and forward to the Newcraighall Park and Ride. Just past the Park and Ride site take the first right and follow the National Cycle Network path, alongside the football park. Follow signage for this route until you arrive at QMU.</p>]]></Value>

      "content": "<p><strong>To make cycling to QMU that bit easier, we have the following facilities:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cycle parking: </strong>there are a number of bike stands installed in university square outside the main academic building, including parking for adapted cycles. There are 2 secured cycle sheds near the halls of residence on campus for long-term cycle storage.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure bike lockers:</strong> for regular cyclists, there are a limited number of secure bike lockers behind the bus stop on campus.</p>\n<p><strong>Lockers: </strong>lockers are available to those actively travelling to campus. They are free to use however the key must be returned when you no longer use the locker.</p>\n<p>Note: personal items should not be left in changing facilities. They should be stored in a locker or carried on your person. </p>\n<p><strong>Showers: </strong>there are showers and changing facilities on level 01 of the main academic building. </p>\n<p><strong>University bike hire schemes: </strong>mechanical bikes are available for hire from the University at £40 per semester. Bike hires include a helmet, a lock, and lights. This is open to staff and students.</p>\n<p>E-bikes can be hired out at £15 per month and are for staff only. The e-bike also comes with a helmet, a lock, and lights.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:cycleconnections@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact address for Cycle Connections\">Contact Cycle Connections</a> if you are interested in either hire scheme.</p>\n<p><strong>Emergency maintenance kits:</strong> the Security Desk has tools, lubricant, a pump, and puncture repair kits for any emergencies that may arise. A hose, located at the grounds workshop can be used freely by those who cycle. Additionally, staff and students can request access to bike cleaning materials. </p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Bike sessions:</strong> the University arranges a mobile mechanic to service bikes cycled in on the day. The mechanic will spend up to 15 minutes per cycle to repair minor problems on the spot. More major problems can be diagnosed and a bike \"MOT\" provided. These sessions are held on the last Tuesday of each month beside the bike racks in University Square.

If the cycle remains for a further month it will be removed and held in storage. If again unclaimed, it will be donated to a local charity. To avoid cycles being removed, students and staff are advised not to leave cycles locked and unmoved on campus for a continuous period of four weeks or more.</p>\n<p>If you would like to give your feedback on how Cycle Connections can improve their services, please fill in <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://forms.office.com/r/hU4GwzfBsd\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to Cycle Connections' feedback form\">this form.</a> </p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Get fit </strong>- on average, those who cycle live two years longer than those who don't, and are as healthy as an average person 10 years younger. Cycling helps raise your metabolic rate and burn calories, and if you commute by bike or by foot, exercise is built into your daily routine!</p>\n<p><strong>Save money -</strong> unlike a car, a bike doesn't require road tax, an MOT, or breakdown cover. Plus, there aren't any fuel bills and parking is free! Similarly, walking only requires a comfortable pair of shoes!</p>\n<p><strong>Get there early -</strong> cycling in cities can be twice as quick as driving, as your journey time usually won't be affected by heavy traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>De-stress -</strong> cycling and walking can be a great way to relieve energy built up by stress and anxiety, particularly after a long day of work!</p>\n<p><strong>Be social </strong>- walking or cycling with others is sociable and fun. Get fit and meet lots of interesting people along the way!</p>\n<p><strong>Help save the planet - </strong>by choosing to actively travel, and to leave the car at home, you are helping the environment, easing congestion, and becoming the change that is necessary to combat climate change. </p>"
