      <Value><![CDATA[<p>It also acknowledges the work of QMU’s PR and knowledge exchange teams in supporting growth and development within Scotland’s small and medium sized food and drink businesses.</p>
<p>The Herald Higher Education Awards celebrate the extraordinary things that are going on in Scotland’s universities and colleges. The inaugural Awards recognise the high standard of education that is offered throughout Scotland and the innovative ways in which institutions market themselves and engage with their audiences.</p>
<p>Lynne Russell, Communications Manager at Queen Margaret University, said: “We are delighted to be recognised in the Herald’s first higher education awards. QMU has a rich history in food and nutrition having been established in 1875 to tackle the dietary issues facing the urban poor. As a result, the original institution focused on educating young women in nutrition and management, equipping them to improve people’s diet and contribute positively to the most pressing needs of society.  Our ‘Recipe for Success’ campaign was inspired by that history.”</p>
<p>Today, the University’s expertise in food and drink includes undergraduate and postgraduate courses as well as specialist commercial research that supports the development of food and drink businesses. QMU’s knowledge exchange work ranges from nutritional analysis through to development of functional products which enhance health and offer practical solutions for industry.</p>
<p>Lynne continued: “Our winning PR campaign focused on the launch of our Scottish Centre for Food Development &amp; Innovation, which is based within the University, and how the Centre’s facilities and research expertise is helping strengthen Scotland’s position as a leader in food and drink innovation in Europe.”</p>
<p>Several local East Lothian businesses have benefitted from the research support provided by food and drink specialists at QMU. These include Black and Gold rapeseed oil and The Chocolate Tree, both Haddington based producers, Belhaven Fruit Farm in Dunbar, jam producer Mabel’s Kitchen in Musselburgh, and Pea Green Boat in Cockenzie.</p>
<p>Louise Elder, Director of Black and Gold rapeseed, said: “Queen Margaret University’s communications team and business manager are passionate about promoting the University’s expertise in food and drink as well as its support of local producers. My business has benefited greatly from my involved with QMU. Not only did the academics conduct the nutritional analysis of my rapeseed oil, the communications team helped promote the nutritional benefits of my product which went far beyond my expectations.”</p>
<p>Louise concluded: “Working in partnership is a major driver for the University and after my initial research project concluded, the PR and business teams have continued to provide me with further marketing, networking and development opportunities. This is a well-deserved win and I hope news of QMU’s work in this area encourages more food and drink companies to harness the expertise that is available within the university.”</p>
