      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The<em> Reading is Braw</em> initiative aims to get children in Wallyford, Whitecraig and Musselburgh to read more.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">For 15 weeks, starting from 1 March 2016, thousands of school pupils across the Musselburgh learning community will be taking part in a reading challenge, including Musselburgh Grammar, Musselburgh Burgh Primary School, Pinkie St. Peter’s Primary School, Wallyford Primary School, Whitecraig Primary School, Campie Primary School, Stoneyhill Primary School and Loretto RC Primary School.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">All school pupils will be given a reading record to keep a note of their reading and after five weeks they’ll get a lanyard to wear which will show the book that they are currently reading.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">There will be rewards and encouragement along the way. At the end of the 15 weeks, there will be a huge celebration in recognition of the children’s reading achievements.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The initiative has received widespread support from the local community.  QMU staff and students are supporting the project in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li class="txtMainBlack">20 QMU staff members have volunteered to deliver regular lunchtime reading sessions in each of the seven participating primary schools throughout the 15-week initiative</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="txtMainBlack">A number of pop-up library/book swap stations will be installed on the QMU campus to encourage pupils to visit the University and further explore the world of books</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="txtMainBlack">Validation of <em>Reading is Braw</em> as a Queen Margaret University Children’s University Learning Experience – participating pupils can gain up to 10 hours of Children’s University learning credit by successfully completing the <em>Reading is Braw</em> challenge</li>
</ul>
<p class="txtMainBlack">QMU is the first higher education institution in the east of Scotland to host the Children’s University which aims to help school children, aged between seven and 14 years of age (and five and six-year-olds with their families), become confident learners and broaden their horizons. Three of Musselburgh’s schools are partners in QMU’s Children’s University with over 350 of their pupils actively taking part in the programme.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Callum Maguire, Head of Outreach and Community Engagement at QMU, said: “We’re thrilled to support such an exciting initiative. <em>Reading is Braw</em> is exactly the kind of fun and engaging learning initiative that our Children’s University aims to support and we are delighted to include it as part of our Children’s University programme for 2016.</p>
<p>“Reading skills are at the heart of all learning and giving children the skills they need to read, and then encouraging them to read more widely and for pleasure, is crucial to improving standards of literacy in our young people and in turn their overall educational achievement.</p>
<p>“That so many of our staff have volunteered to support the in-school lunchtime reading sessions is testament to the University’s commitment to playing an active role within our local communities and encouraging a love of learning amongst young people.”</p>

<p class="txtMainBlack">The <em>Reading is Braw</em> initiative is a partnership project between Queen Margaret University, East Lothian Council, Musselburgh Area Partnership and Support from the Start.</p>
