      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>The move builds on the highly successful portfolio of teaching courses that Queen Margaret University has offered in recent years – including a four-year primary teaching degree and a postgraduate course in home economics.</span> </p>
<p><span>The University is now accepting applicants for its new PGDE Secondary (Business Education) which will attract graduates who already have a degree in accounting, economics or business management, and who want to teach young people. It will suit graduates who have a passion for the subject of business education but who are interested in linking this within social justice, sustainability and health and wellbeing agenda.</span> </p>
<p><span>Simon Hoult, Associate Head of Psychology, Sociology and Education at Queen Margaret University, explained: “As the world recovers from the pandemic and deals with the economic impact of war and other global challenges, there has never been a more pressing time to develop a new generation of inspirational teachers who can transform young lives and prepare them for 21st century global citizenship.”</span> <span></span></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="The new PGDE Secondary (Business Education) will equip graduate teachers with the skills, knowledge and understanding to help young people evaluate the social, ethical, and global factors that affect local, national and multinational organisations. If business graduates are looking for an inspiring, challenging and socially empowering career in teaching, then I think our new PGDE Secondary (Business Education) will certainly provide an exciting career pathway which allows them to blend their passion for business with the education of young people." source="Simon Hoult, Associate Head of Psychology, Sociology and Education at Queen Margaret University" sourceExtra="" />
<p>Simon confirmed: “Queen Margaret University’s courses are very focused on employability. Successful graduates of this course will be guaranteed a year’s paid employment in a secondary school in Scotland as a business education teacher.” </p>
<p><span>Sir Paul Grice, Principal of Queen Margaret University, concluded: “Our initial teacher education courses, including PGDE Secondary (Business Education), take a fresh and vibrant approach to learning to teach in Scotland. Our strong focus on social justice allows us to attract and educate people who want to make a real difference to the world around them. What better way to do that than to educate a future generation of young people who have a social conscience and can help shape businesses and organisations to contribute to the sustainability of communities, our country and the wider world.”</span> </p>
