      <Value><![CDATA[<p>As well as balancing his full-time work commitments with family life, Ross is studying PgCert Medical Imaging (MRI Clinical Reporting) part-time at QMU.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Ross has been a diagnostic radiographer since graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree from QMU in 2005. He started his career with NHS Fife as a band 5 general radiographer and in 2008 he obtained a training post within the specialised imaging modality of MRI. He secured a full-time permanent band 7 post and is currently deputising as superintendent MRI radiographer.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Ross is currently a Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR) Union Learning Representative (ULR). In this role he encourages learning and development and supports members with Continuous Professional Development (CPD).</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Why did you choose to study at QMU?</strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“I’ve always been keen to develop my own clinical skills, obtain a formal postgraduate qualification and lead by example. I was delighted when QMU developed these MRI modules as there was previously no institution in Scotland offering such postgraduate academic opportunities. </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“Having studied at QMU as an undergraduate in 2001-2005, I knew I was going to receive a high standard of academic learning. I was keen to start using the fantastic facilities and resources available at QMU.”</em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>What have you enjoyed most about the course? </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“The first 15 credit module (Principles of MRI) has been very enjoyable and all content has been relevant and can be applied to current clinical practice.” </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>What are your plans after completing the course?</strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“With financial support from National Education for Scotland (NES) through the Allied Health Professionals Careers Fellowship Scheme and clinical support and mentorship from NHS Fife, I hope to achieve my professional goals of becoming an advanced practitioner undertaking the role of clinical reporting of MRI lumbar spine examinations. </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“I believe there are MRI reporting radiographers in NHS England and Wales but I’m not aware of any other radiographer with this qualification who is currently practising this role in Scotland.”</em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Top tips for future students? </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“Although teaching days at QMU are kept to a minimum to ensure that all content is delivered, it’s essential that you have the support from your employer as well as support from a Consultant Radiologist (if doing Clinical Reporting module). </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“Networking and getting involved in discussions with other students on the course has given me ideas and suggestions for improvements that I can take back to my own clinical department. </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><em>“It’s been hard work juggling home life, full-time employment and part-time study. There often doesn’t feel like there are enough hours in a day but hopefully it will all be worthwhile in the end. I may even return in the future to complete the full Masters programme and achieve an MSc degree.” </em></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>MSc Medical Imaging </strong></p>
