      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh/Scotland?</span></p>
<p>“I wanted to do an undergraduate degree in the UK, as it has a global reputation for quality assured education. I’m also more accustomed to the UK style of teaching as I previously completed the Cambridge GCE Advanced Level programme.</p>
<p>“I’ve always admired Edinburgh for its rich history and culture, being home to multi-cultural communities and people from all walks of life. I felt that I’d appreciate being in a city that was so diverse as it reminds me of my home country, Malaysia, which is also well-known for its diverse ethnicities and cultures.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">What are your highlights of living and studying in Edinburgh? </span></p>
<p>“I came to Edinburgh towards the end of the Fringe Festival and managed to catch quite a few shows. I had my first ceilidh during Freshers’ Week and immediately fell in love with it – I’ve attended nine ceilidhs this semester, which says a lot.</p>
<p>“On the weekends I enjoy going to Edinburgh city as it has so much to offer. I particularly like going to different museums and my favourite has to be the National Museum of Scotland.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">Are there any hidden ‘gems’ in Edinburgh you’d like to share with other QMU students?</span></p>
<p>“The Cammo Estate is definitely my little haven. It’s a great place to go for a walk for a break from the glow of a computer screen. The Japanese Garden at Lauriston Castle is my personal favourite place to go and is definitely worth a visit! There is also a nature reserve right outside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which a friend happened to stumble upon and recommend to me.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">Where have you lived whilst studying at QMU? </span></p>
<p>“For the first year of university, I decided to stay in student accommodation on the QMU campus for convenience purposes. I thoroughly enjoy every part of it. Living in halls which is a short walk away from the main academic building definitely stops me from worrying about being trapped in the morning commute.</p>
<p>“I also appreciate that the halls are in close proximity to the train station and a bus stop is directly on campus, making travelling a lot easier.</p>
<p>“I’m fortunate enough to be staying in a flat with people that come from different countries, offering me an insight into their culture and lifestyle. I look forward to spending time with them every day, sharing laughs and meals as they really do make me feel at home.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study BSc (Hons) Diagnostic Radiography at QMU?</span></p>
<p>“This may sound cliché but ever since high school, I’ve developed a deep interest and passion for medicine and healthcare. It was towards the end of my college education that I was introduced to radiography, which is not a popular degree back in Malaysia.</p>
<p>“I felt that radiography was more in line with what I wanted in a career, as well as the lifestyle it brings. <em>Radiography</em> is a fast-moving and continually changing profession. It combines science, technology and patient care and is at the <em>heart of</em> modern healthcare. </p>
<p> “I was researching for universities in the UK that offer diagnostic radiography as an undergraduate course but was concerned as most universities have massive class sizes, which I didn’t think would suit me. I opted for Queen Margaret University as the class size for diagnostic radiography are more friendly and supportive, which offers a conducive environment for me to develop close-knit relationships with my lecturers and course mates.</p>
<p>“I appreciate that the course is spread over four years, offering a detailed course structure and clinical placement experiences.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">What have been the highlights of the course and your time at QMU so far? </span></p>
<p>“During my first semester, I had classes in the X-ray room, which I had the opportunity to learn about X-ray equipment, the principle behind x-ray projections and how to operate x-ray equipment to produce radiographs. The knowledge and the hands-on skills combined would come very useful when I go onto clinical placement in my second semester.</p>
<p>“I’m currently a class representative and I involve myself in the academic aspect of my course by attending frequent academic council meetings, which aim to enhance the overall student experience in my course.</p>
<p>“I also help out as a Student Ambassador for Open Days and campus tours. Perhaps in my next semester, I would venture into getting a part-time job, hopefully, related to healthcare.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">What are your top tips for future BSc (Hons) Diagnostic Radiography students based on your own personal experiences</span>?</p>
<p>“Be disciplined and manage your time properly as there is a lot to learn about diagnostic radiography.</p>
<p>“Aside from lectures, seminar and workshops, a huge part of the learning process is actually self-directed. It’s always good to engage in group discussions and be open to new learning opportunities.</p>
<p>“QMU provides great support in terms of learning and I’ve found the Learning Resources Centre especially helpful for students where English is not their first language.</p>
<p>“Lecturers are very supportive and are constantly available to offer help and guidance in their best efforts, so do not be afraid to ask questions.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">What are your plans after graduating from QMU?</span></p>
<p>“After graduation from this course, I plan to look for local job opportunities to gain more work experience, and would probably pursue a postgraduate degree after gaining work experience as a radiographer.”</p>
