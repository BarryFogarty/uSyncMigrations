Central to this strategy is the need for learners to engage in the learning experiences, a readiness to listen and explore, preparedness to be open to experiences and a resolve to keep going. This environment will generate an ethos of engagement where students can explore and challenge theories, practices and different sources of knowledge creatively in an atmosphere of high challenge and high support.</p>\n<p>Students will be supported to challenge their thinking, values and beliefs, through the posing of complex activities and questions, and develop resilient and sustainable approaches to their learning and practice in response to these. Critical to this process is the use of diverse knowledge, scholarly inquiry processes and evidence-informed materials to engage and enliven the processes of learning. Assessment strategies will encourage application to practice. This will be achieved through the use of varied strategies that draw on the student’s own areas of practice such as portfolio development, practice proposals, annotated bibliographies, simulation events, games,  seminar presentations and self-determined contextual assignment topics. Tutor, peer and self-assessment, including within virtual environments (eg HUB@QMU), will be an important component of approaches to formative and summative assessment. For students undertaking NMC-recognised specialist qualification and registration (District Nursing, Health Visiting, School Nursing), the course is 50% practice-based and requires placement in an approved practice. To support learners in their practice learning environment they will be assigned to a Practice Supervisor and a Practice Assessor. Placement will be negotiated with your supporting NHS area.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement</strong></p>\n<p>The course is 50% theory and 50% practice based. You must have access to a practice placement, a Practice Supervisor, and a Practice Assessor.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>The School Nursing course is NMC validated and leads to the Specialist Community Public Health Nurse Qualification, and therefore the hours for theory and practice are stipulated by the NMC. It is a full-time course over 52 weeks. Holidays are set by the university and spread throughout the year.</p>\n<p>In semester one for the first six weeks you will be full-time in university (either face-to-ace teaching, online session or self-study). From week seven you will be in practice placement for two days a week alongside university study days. Semester two will be full time in practice placement along with university study days. Semester three is a 10-week period of practice consolidation where you will be full time for 50 consecutive days in practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Class sizes will vary.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
