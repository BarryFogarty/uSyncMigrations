<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The MSc Music Therapy sits together with Art Psychotherapy, Dramatherapy and Play Therapy as an arts therapies pathway within the Person-Centred Practice Framework, in the School of Health Sciences. In this context, we are continuing to develop a programme that is built on our reputation at QMU as a dynamic hub for teaching, learning and research into music therapy in Scotland and internationally.</p>
<p>The roots of the music therapy profession in the United Kingdom (UK) are strongly influenced by both psychoanalytic thinking and creative musical improvisation and the MSc Music Therapy at QMU continues to combine this eclectic attitude. Within the tradition of the profession, the music therapy programme at QMU draws largely upon psychodynamic theory in exploring and explaining the process of music therapy. When we think about the music making in music therapy and about the music therapy relationship or group, we do so with consideration of conscious and unconscious processes.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The music – what may be felt, sounded and shared - is received as expressive of an inner experience that may have previously been unconscious, inaccessible, or unarticulated.</p>
<p>What happens between the music therapist and the person in therapy or between music therapy group members, is considered as potentially having roots in early experience; as the presenting past that can be worked with as patterns of relating, and ways of being come into consciousness through interactions and within the music making. The reparative possibilities of music therapy can be understood with reference to the conditions that influence development within early years and we seek to provide therapeutic environments that provide the security, holding and containment conducive to the work and play of music therapy.</p>
<p>As a music therapy learner, you will attend psycho-dynamically oriented personal therapy throughout your training and in this weekly space, you will work with your own conscious and unconscious processes towards the ultimate goal of becoming a more sensitive and attuned person. You will attend interpersonal learning groups; a forum for experiencing and exploring what may happen between people, with the use of music making as a means of deepening and enriching the relational experience, again with the end focus on gaining the skills you will need in practice. Supervision groups will be an opportunity for you to work with your supervisor and your peers to explore the music and the interpersonal dynamics within your practice-based learning music therapy sessions, engaging with what may be happening on conscious and unconscious levels. The staff team also individually attend psycho-dynamically informed supervision to think about their practice and our work with you as learners.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In a music therapy relationship, the music therapist is sensitive to power dynamics that arise with different roles. In learning to be with the person, we practise the skills of careful attunement, of developing our awareness of what may be happening at an intersubjective level, of carefully attending to the sounds and music, often working in a way that is primarily non-verbal and always listening to the person and their story. In this way, the music therapy process is a fundamentally person-centred one. The person in music therapy makes use of the space to experience themselves more fully in a context of respect for, and sensitivity towards, personhood wherever they may be in their life journey and at a pace that is right for them. The stance of the music therapist in contemporary practice is very much one of being ‘alongside’ (albeit within clear professional boundaries) rather than one of expert- practitioner. The person in therapy leads the work and is encouraged to discover personal meaning and direction.</p>
<p>Since the programme was revalidated in 2020, this essential person-centredness of music therapy meets the Person-centred Practice Framework, an established framework for practice developed by Professor Brendan McCormack and colleagues in the Division of Nursing and Paramedic Science at Queen Margaret University Edinburgh. All aspects of teaching, learning and practice are supported within this framework.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The modular structure that incorporates two core Person-centred Practice Framework modules in addition to the arts therapies specific modules opens up an exciting opportunity for us to engage in shared learning and dialogue with our colleagues beyond the arts therapies, to engage with critical thinking more widely in the area of personhood and person-centred practice, moving between thinking about our work as music therapists and the wider systems and cultures in which we may find ourselves as professionals. We will consider a range of philosophical perspectives on personhood and how these perspectives may relate to our practice context and to healthful cultures and human <span style="font-size: 14px;">flourishing within the sectors in which we work. There will be ongoing opportunities to look at ourselves and our work in relation to Person-centred theory and consider how we may lead and facilitate Person-centred practice within our workplace, particularly in relation to our role as music therapists, using music as a vehicle for positive growth and development within a therapeutic environment.</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The programme team are very much looking forward to working with you as together we weave the threads of the new Person-Centred Practice Framework modules into the overall learning within the MSc Music Therapy in what promises to be a creative and dynamic phase in the life of the programme.</p>

True to the values of their profession, they have integrated ways of doing and being, demonstrating professional artistry through confident application of their range of knowledge. They are reflexive, thoughtful, able to draw on philosophical ideas, and can engage in critical discussions. As collaborators, they negotiate across boundaries with a balance of courage, creativity, humour and ability to be vulnerable. They are responsive and inspiring leaders, who accept responsibility and create conditions for empowerment of self and others.

All the modules integrate learning across practical, theoretical, experiential and research based fields. The programme puts emphasis on experiential learning, peer support and self-development so directed and independent study is inherent in all modules. It is a two-year full-time pre-registration programme, where all modules are core. There will be opportunities for the music therapy learners to work with other learners from other AHP programmes and Nursing within QMU, and most closely with learners from other arts therapies programmes.</p>\n<p>In Year 1, teaching takes place at University two days per week (Tuesday and Wednesday) with practice-based learning one day each week; in Year 2, teaching takes place on one day each week (Thursday) with practice-based learning two days each week. At University, learners participate in lectures, workshops, seminars, small and large group activities, tutorials and supervision groups. Some modules contain inter-disciplinary and inter-professional working, teaching and delivery.</p>\n<p>In order for learners to be fit for purpose and eligible for registration with the HCPC, the programme has been developed in accordance with the relevant benchmarking documents and, in particular, the HCPC Standards of Education and Training (2017), the HCPC Standards of Proficiency for Arts Therapists (2013) along with consideration of key healthcare drivers.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Overview of modules</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Learners will be given information for each module, including assessment, reading and other resources at the start of each year.

The modules are separate but relate to, and inform each other.</p>\n<p>Learner-led seminars, peer presentations (with peer and personal self-assessment) interpersonal learning groups and supervision groups encourage learners’ responsibility for themselves and for each other. The juxtaposition of academic and practice education occurring in the same week over the whole programme, facilitates the meaningful experiences of learners. This allows continuous integration with issues from practice-based learning being brought into the classroom and allowing <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">theoretical concepts to be applied.

This facilitates invaluable personal and professional growth. Learners are required to undertake personal therapy throughout the programme, beginning in the first Semester, and normally to stay with the same therapist throughout the training. This work is not assessed however learners must provide signed evidence from their therapist showing that they have attended a minimum of 40 hours personal therapy by the end of the course.</p>\n<p>Therapists have varying approaches depending on their theoretical framework. The course has a theoretical focus, which is largely psychodynamic so a therapist following this approach is recommended. It may be helpful to bear the following points in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that the therapist is appropriately qualified with at least 5 years’ experience</li>\n<li>Find a therapist you feel comfortable with and feel you can trust</li>\n<li>Psychodynamic psychotherapy and analytical psychotherapy approaches are most suitable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Confidentiality is a vital aspect of all psychotherapeutic relationships and a necessary prerequisite for establishing conditions of trust and safety. It is important, therefore, that contact between the programme and each learner’s therapist be kept to an absolute minimum. Some contact, however, is obviously necessary in order to ensure learners fulfil this particular requirement of the programme.<br />All learners will be asked to provide the Programme Leader with the name and address of their therapist as soon as possible after entering therapy. In rare cases, the Programme Leader may contact a therapist if there was due concern for the learner’s wellbeing. At the end of the programme, each learner’s therapist will be requested to complete and return a form confirming that the required amount of personal therapy has been undertaken. These sessions are not funded by the University and costs must be covered by the learner.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em>For useful links to find a therapist, see Appendix 12.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Interpersonal Learning Group</span></span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>This experiential group forms a key element in the learner’s development in year 1 and is part of the module Developmental and Relational Perspectives.

The programme leader coordinates programme evaluation, annual monitoring, correspondence with module coordinators, and oversees the programme’s teaching and learning as well as issues as they arise, including supporting staff and learners in difficult circumstances.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Module Coordinators</strong> manage the day-to-day running of a module and are the face-to-face contact with the learners. They have an overall responsibility for the organisation of the teaching and learning of the module, assuring that learners have access to online materials and updated module information e.g. assessment. Likewise feedback of assignment comments to learners and module evaluation are undertaken in this role.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Learning, teaching and assessment<a href=\"http://capsadvocacy.org\" title=\"CAPS Advocacy website\">CAPS Advocacy website</a></span></p>\n<p>The learning, teaching and assessment methods for the MSc Music Therapy develop increasingly independent learners. Learners participate in lectures, workshops, seminars, small and large group activities, tutorials and supervision groups. The programme team aims to enable learners to learn from and with others, through supportive peer-assessment and feedback and collaborative working is promoted.</p>\n<p>The programme puts emphasis on experiential learning, peer support and self-development. In addition to University and online learning, learners attend practice-based learning. Directed and independent study forms part in all modules in the programme and information about each module is provided at the start of each year.</p>\n<p>We continue to use a wide range of learning and teaching formats developed as appropriate to particular modules and levels of the programme which are commensurate with and facilitate the assessment of the HCPC competencies. The competencies, standards and guidance outlined in the following HCPC documents underpin the MSc Music Therapy programme, to ensure that learners are provided with the appropriate learning and teaching opportunities to meet the standards of proficiency for Arts Therapists (2013).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">HUB</span></p>\n<p>The QMU e-learning environment, the Hub, is used as a teaching platform (virtual learning), and learning resources for all modules. Learners should frequently consult the programme and module areas on the Hub for up to date programme changes and news</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Involvement of service users and carers</span></p>\n<p>Service users and carers are an integral part of the programme and are invited to teach in both years.

As part of the research-related input of the programme, year 1 and year 2 learners are encouraged to take part in Journal Club meetings. Learners are invited to make a note of the key ideas and questions discussed at the meeting, and these notes are shared on the HUB.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Learner Conference</span></p>\n<p>This runs annually in November, is entirely learner-led and provides a fantastic way for graduates and current learners to collaborate, learn from each other and network.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Self-reflection</span></p>\n<p>It is essential that music therapists are reflective practitioners and recognise the importance of their own developing musicianship. Reflection is used as a learning and assessment technique (formative and summative) both within classes from University and practice-based learning. Examples include: self-appraisal, reflective essays, reflective journals and reflective discussions.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Assessment</span></p>\n<p>The assessment requirements for the programme ensure that each learner is considered fit to practise as a music therapist. In keeping with the descriptors set at SCQF Level 11, it is important that in each area of assessment, learners are able to demonstrate critical understanding.<br />Assessments within the programme are both written and practical, summative and formative. For summative purposes, assignments will be graded according to specific criteria to each module. The criteria are set out in each module’ assessment.</p>\n<p>In general, the assessment pattern for each module reflects the aims and learning outcomes for that module. Information about assessments will be given at the beginning of each module, which will include full assessment specifications, due dates and criteria. A summary of the different assessments are shown in Tables 5 and 6 for Year 1 and 2 respectively.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>These will be used in conjunction with the Grade Marking Criteria for Taught Postgraduate Modules, (<em>see Appendix 13</em>).</p>\n<p>Assignments which are formatively assessed by staff and/ or fellow learners are equally important and provide opportunities for learners to learn from each other, articulate critical thinking and offer peer support.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>All supervision and assessment will comply with University policies.

Ill- judged remarks could potentially mean that you may face disciplinary action from the University and/or Fitness to Practise measures within the School of Health Sciences.</p>\n<p>Whilst you are at liberty to tweet or post what you like, please be aware that increasingly members of the public are using the same legal framework originally designed for the ‘traditional’ print media, to take legal action against those who tweet disparaging, ill-conceived or rude/degrading messages. This often is not as straight- forward as it sounds. For example, how a posting is perceived is very often open to interpretation, and what you intended the posting to mean may not be how it is received.
