      "content": "<p>The BA (Hons) Performance award offers a new articulation route for students who have already achieved an HND in Acting and Performance. Building on the performance modules that we successfully deliver on our Drama programme, it provides a tailored route to a degree level qualification for those students who find they learn best through the physical exploration of the subject. Focusing on the breadth of forms that performance can take, the programme will be of interest to those who wish to explore the potential of performance beyond the conventional modes and spaces with which it is most traditionally associated.</p>\n<p>Teaching on the programme is comprised of a combination of workshops, lectures, seminars, tutorials, case studies, demonstrations, simulation exercises, embedded skills training, field trips and projects. The methods used vary from module to module. Students’ performance is assessed through a variety of methods including performances, presentations, essays, reports, reflective portfolios, group work exercises, and a practical dissertation or project.</p>"

The teaching team recognises that student-to-student interaction can be a highly effective learning activity and use various forms of group work, problem-solving groups, case based learning and project production teams, to enable this.</p>\n<p>Peer teaching is enabled through the use of seminar presentations, postings of individual and group research processes on the Hub and/or PebblePad, and collaborative devising or workshop generation processes. Students are encouraged to be enquiring, critical and innovative. Emphasis is placed on analytical, divergent ways of thinking. In addition to their own independent learning, students also initiate and lead individual tutorials/workshops with members of staff related to coursework or dissertation supervision. Most modules on the BA (Hons) Performance are core, with one optional module in Year Three and one in Year Four.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

An interview with the applicant may be arranged in order to gather evidence. Entry would normally be based on the following criteria:</p>\n<p>• Evidence of aptitude in written English, which is essential for ensuring applicants will be able to cope with the written assessments required.<br />• A personal statement demonstrating a realistic anticipation of the challenges presented by the degree and a sense of their potential to meet these.<br />• Experience of/enthusiasm for drama whether as an audience member or as a theatre-maker that is gauged within what was accessible to the candidate. In some parts of Scotland there is little youth theatre, little offer of drama within secondary education and limited access to professional theatre performances.<br />• Qualifications demonstrating the ability to engage in sustained, systematic study even if this is not within the standard entry requirements (see below for the recognition of prior learning).</p>\n<p>Applications for entry with general advanced standing (ie credit for previous study) are referred to the University’s Recognition of Prior Learning Panel. Credit may be given for prior experiential learning. Normally, credit given will be specific rather than general (ie on a subject for subject basis).</p>\n<p>International: IELTS of 6.0 with no element lower than 5.5</p>"
