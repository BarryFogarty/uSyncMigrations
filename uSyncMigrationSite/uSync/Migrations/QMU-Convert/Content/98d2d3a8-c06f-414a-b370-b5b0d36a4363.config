      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships scheme helps students undertake an independent research project in any academic field of study during the summer vacation. It is designed for third year students on a four year honours degree course or fourth year students on a five year honours degree course.</p>
<p>The scheme supports eligible students to develop valuable research skills, investigate a topic of particular interest and their academic writing. Scholarships can last between two and six weeks, supported by a grant of £225 per week from The Carnegie Trust.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Trust is a charitable organisation founded by Scots-American steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie, in 1901. For over a century, the Trust has funded student fees, scholarships, bursaries and research grants. It operates across all academic disciplines to encourage wider access to higher education and further research in Scottish universities. With annual funding of around £2.5 million, the Trust is one of the largest educational grant giving charities in Scotland.</p>
<p>In 2015, five QMU students were supported by The Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships scheme, receiving over £4,500 from The Trust between them:</p>
<p>Charlotte Kay, BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy<br />Grant Burns, BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy<br />Kirsty Daly, BSc (Hons) Occupational Therapy<br />Lucy O’Brien, BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy<br />Lynsey Robertson-Flannigan, BSc (Hons) Occupational Therapy</p>
<p>In previous years, BSc (Hons) Psychology and BSc (Hons) Psychology &amp; Sociology students from QMU have also won Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships.</p>
<p>Commenting on how The Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships scheme helped her, Charlotte Kay, BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy, said: “I was delighted to be offered the Carnegie Vacation Scholarship last summer. I began the project between third and fourth year which was ideal timing as my honours project was fast approaching.</p>
<p>“It was an invaluable opportunity that allowed me to experience an area of Physiotherapy that I would not have been able to without the project. It also allowed me to develop skills that will be put to good use throughout university and beyond.</p>
<p>“The application was simple and consisted of two stages involving writing a proposal for my project. This experience alone has already benefited me greatly during my final year. Being familiar with the process made the writing of my honours project proposal much less stressful.</p>
<p>“The experience of the project, once approved, was fantastic. It gave me the opportunity to develop skills in collecting, analysing and writing up of results, which I feel are highly important for fourth year students.</p>
<p>“Based on feedback from lecturers and other Physiotherapists on placement, they have all commented on how good this experience will look on job applications in the future.</p>
<p>“I would 100% recommend the Carnegie Scholarship, the skills you will develop will without a doubt benefit you in the future!”</p>
<p>QMU students should ask their Programme Leader for more information on making an application for The Carnegie Trust: Vacation Scholarships scheme. The application form is available on the QMU School Office website: www.qmu.ac.uk/school-office</p>
<p>Applicants must be Scottish by birth, descent or residence and should submit their applications to Sheena Watson (School Manager for Arts, Social Sciences &amp; Management) E: swatson@qmu.ac.uk or Jenny Ansett (School Manager for Health Sciences) E: jansett@qmu.ac.uk by Friday 12th February 2016.</p>
