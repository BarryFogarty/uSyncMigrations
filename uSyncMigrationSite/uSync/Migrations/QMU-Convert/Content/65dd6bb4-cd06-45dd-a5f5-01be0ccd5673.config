      "content": "<p> </p>\n<p>I am the Programme Lead for the Post Graduate Diploma Person-Centred Practice [District Nursing] [Pg Dip PCP DN], and the Graduate Diploma in Integrated Community Nursing [GD ICN] and teach into all modules on both programmes. Until January 2020 I held the role as Programme Lead for the Independent and Supplementary Prescribing programme. </p>\n<p>I am involved in providing both academic and placement support to learners, and learner and qualified Practice Assessors and Supervisors, within the specialty of District Nursing, and Independent and Supplementary Prescribing.  I am an Academic Assessor for both the District Nursing and Independent and Supplementary Prescribing programmes. </p>\n<p>I am also part of the International Collaborations moderation team for the British University in Egypt, for their community nursing programme for pre-registration nurses. </p>\n<p>I am passionate about Community Nursing and recognise the central role it plays in service delivery of healthcare in community settings. Gaining my SPQ qualification was transformational. Of course, it equipped me with the knowledge and skills required to be an effective team leader, team manager, caseload manager, and case manager, but it gave me far more than this. The SPQ qualification helped me appreciate how to identify and manage risk as well as identify challenges and inequity in health care provision. It taught me about myself: who I am, how I think and why I think as I do. In addition the SPQ qualification transformed me as a person and enabled me to thrive, grow, develop, and push myself like never before. It encourages me to become the evidence-based, critical thinker I am today, widening my thinking and viewpoints.   </p>\n<p>In January 2017 I was honoured and privileged to be one of twenty candidates accepted onto the Queens Nurse Award 9-month development programme –the first for 50 years and   received my award in December 2017. The title is awarded to ‘clinical leaders who can demonstrate their impact as expert practitioners’. </p>\n<p>My recent practice background is in District Nursing. Prior to my current post at Queen Margaret University my role was as Team Manager for Community Nursing within a Health and Social Care Partnership.  I have worked within the Community for over 23 years, firstly as a Practice Nurse, before landing a much sought-offer role as a Community Nurse. Most recently I have worked as a District Nurse for over 18 years. During my community career, I have worked with in England and Scotland, providing care in areas from those of severe deprivation to those with more prosperity in both city and rural geographies. </p>\n<p>This is an exciting time to be involved in nurse education, within the current climate of integration and advance of person-centred care approaches. I believe I have the ability to enthuse, motivate and encourage learners and I know I have the drive and ambition to meet the challenge of working as a Lecturer in Community Nursing. To have the opportunity of meeting this challenge on a daily basis, in an inspiring and rewarding profession makes me proud and I am energised by playing a part in this. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Affiliations (including memberships) to other organisations:   </span></p>\n<p>Vice Chair Scottish Network of Post Registration Community Nurse Educators</p>\n<p>Vice Chair Scottish Prescribing Programme Leads Network [SPPLeN]</p>\n<p>Member Scottish Advanced Practice Educators Network</p>\n<p>Member of Omega Xi Chapter </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sigmanursing.org/\" title=\"Link to Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing\">Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/about-the-university/university-court/\" title=\"Link to QMU Court\">Member of Queen Margaret University Court </a></p>\n<p>Member of Queen Margaret University Senate </p>"
