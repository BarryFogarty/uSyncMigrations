Retrospective checking of current employees carrying out regulated work will take place throughout 2012/13.</p>\n<p>The PVG Scheme, which will be managed by Disclosure Scotland is intended to strengthen safeguards for children and vulnerable adults.

(See section 3.3 Lists and Consideration for Listing)</p>\n<p>It is an offence for an individual to do; or seek to do regulated work for which they are barred. It is also an offence for an organisation to knowingly recruit an individual to do regulated work for which they are barred.</p>\n<p>Disclosure Scotland does not provide a list of positions which constitute regulated work, it is the responsibility of the University to determine, within the guidance given, if an individual is or will be carrying out regulated work.</p>\n<p>The legislation defines regulated work with reference to (i) the activities an individual does (ii) the establishment in which a person works (iii) the position that they hold and (iv) or the people for whom they have day to day supervision for.</p>\n<p>Human Resources will advise at the start of the recruitment process, in consultation with the appropriate manager, whether the post holder will be carrying out regulated work.</p>\n<p>Where there is a requirement for the post holder to be a member of the PVG Scheme this will be stated on the job description which is available to all applicants during the recruitment process.</p>\n<p>Any offers of employment for regulated positions will be subject to membership of the PVG scheme.

Once an individual is listed they will be barred from carrying out regulated work with one or both groups.</p>\n<p>In some cases individuals will be barred from working with one group but not the other. In this case the Scheme Record will only include information relating to the type of regulated work applied for (either regulated work with vulnerable adults or regulated work with children) and will not inform the University that the individual is barred from carrying out regulated work with the other group. However the record may show the information that led to the individual being barred from working with one of the groups i.e. a conviction. In this case the University can take this information into account when deciding whether to employ the individual.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">PVG Scheme Membership and Records</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Where an individual is deemed to be carrying out regulated work either when recruited by the University or during retrospective checking they will be asked to complete the PVG Scheme Membership Application Form.</p>\n<p>A Scheme Record will be sent to both the Registered Body (the University) and the individual, the Scheme Record will detail any relevant conviction and/or vetting information.</p>\n<p>Where an individual is not able to join the PVG Scheme the University and the individual will be sent a letter confirming that the individual is barred from joining the PVG Scheme.

Disclosure information will only be retained for longer than this period in exceptional circumstances which justify retention for a longer period. The same conditions relating to secure storage and access will apply during any such period.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Disposal</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Once the retention period has elapsed, we will ensure that Disclosure information is immediately destroyed in a secure manner i.e. by shredding, pulping or burning. QMU will ensure that Disclosure information which is awaiting destruction will not be kept in any insecure receptacle (e.g. a waste bin or confidential waste sack). We will not retain any image or photocopy or any other form of the Disclosure information. We will, however, keep a record of the date of issue of the Disclosure, the name of the subject, the Disclosure type, the position for which the Disclosure was requested, the unique reference number of the Disclosure and details of the recruitment decision taken.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>February 2011</p>\n<p>Responsibility for Policy </p>\n<p>Human Resources</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
