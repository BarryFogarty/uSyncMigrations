<ul>
<li><strong>A truly unique course:</strong> This is the first MSc in Mad Studies internationally. It has been designed in partnership with <a href="https://capsadvocacy.org/">CAPS Independent Advocacy</a> and academics at QMU from the Occupational Therapy and Public Sociology subject area. It has developed from the ongoing “Oor Mad History” project at CAPS and the Mad Studies short course at QMU titled “<a href="/{localLink:umb://document/7b1bb9438e7f4f4fa99e46b79aa1be02}" title="Mad People’s History and Identity">Mad Peoples' History and identity</a>”.</li>
<li><strong>Funding opportunities:</strong> There are some funded places for people with lived experience of mental health issues.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible study options:</strong> Full-time, part-time, blended (part campus, part online), fully online.</li>
<li><strong>Learn from a range of experts:</strong> Your studies will be driven by regular engagement with activists and educators from the mad community and the close sharing of insights with your peers on the course. You’ll learn from academics and activists who have diverse community experience, and who are engaged with critical education, activism and innovative research.</li>
<li><strong>Person-centred focus:</strong> The course is part of QMU’s <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/e22a3615c3984a4290a23ffea7f3048e}" title="Person-centred Practice and Post-Registration Practice">Person-centred Practice Framework</a>. The Framework offers a person-centred approach to learning, fostered through four processes of engagement: experimentation, collaboration, critical discourse and evidence-informed perspectives. Specifically, the MSc course aims to ensure the centrality of mad studies to facilitate learning at master’s level.</li>
<li><strong>Industry links:</strong> There are opportunities to apply your own learning to your context. Teaching staff have a range of links with community, voluntary sector and campaign groups in civil society. This has included CAPS Independent Advocacy, Friends of the Earth, Glasgow Association for Mental Health, the Workers’ Educational Association, the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal, and various faith-based, trade union and European social policy organisations. We also work in partnership with a range of activists within the mad movement nationally and internationally.</li>

      "content": "<p>Mad studies is an emerging academic discipline that explores the global knowledge that has emerged from the mad movement. This body of knowledge includes the exploration of the dominant understandings of madness. It examines individual and collective experiences of madness. It offers a critique of the mental health service landscape and the cultural and socio-political responses experienced by the mad community. It evaluates activist responses and the creation of mad knowledge and action.</p>\n<p>What is central to the philosophy of this MSc Mad Studies course is the importance of the mad community critiquing the dominant discourses on madness by creating its own discourses, spaces, partnerships, alternatives and organisations. At its analytic core mad studies should have mad people, mad issues and mad culture.</p>\n<p>As a student on this course you will be part of a diverse and intersecting community of learners that include people with lived experience and members of the mad community, public sociology students and professionals from the public and third sector. You will explore the potential impact of mad studies in diverse contexts.</p>\n<p>This course offers you the opportunity to engage with diverse public groups and to reflect critically on how mad studies can contribute to work for social justice and change. You will study what is distinctive about Mad Studies and Public Sociology and the methods of engagement and research of the disciplines.</p>\n<p>The course draws on the experiences of mad studies scholars and activists throughout the world and involves teaching by academics from a range of disciplines in which mad studies is relevant. Lecturers are engaged in research, education and activism with various communities within society.</p>"
