<p>Operating at the intersection of ‘arts’ and ‘management’ the aim of this project was to locate creative practice research within a local authority museum as a way to interrogate, explore and expand the ‘publicness’ of a public museum collection. The Culture Perth and Kinross Museum is a “recognised collection of National Significance” (Scottish Gov’t, 2014) and has as part of their museum collection over 1 million individual items, but only 1% of this collection is ever on display. The rest is kept behind temperature-controlled, secured, locked doors, and therefore not accessible by ‘the public’. Similarly, the museum Collection Managers – a small group of experts from the local area who are predominantly white, cis-gendered, and middle-class – act as gatekeepers as to which items are collected, displayed, or discussed. Whilst the staff are representative of some of the population of Perthshire, their position and power beg the question of how a small, select group of individuals can speak to an entirety of a public? As such, this research explored in what ways could creative practice could explore and encourage an expanded public engagement with museum collection.</p>
<p>This project ran from June 2019 - July 2022, with a significant pause due to Covid lockdown.</p>]]></Value>
