<p>Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings, Active Travel and Tenants' Rights, Patrick Harvie MSP, joined representatives from Paths for All, East Lothian Council and QMU to see the benefits this project has delivered.</p>
<p>The path, which runs under the railway line between residential areas at Craighall Drive and Monktonhall Place also links the University with NCR1, has been revitalised following a £58,800 grant from Paths for All’s Ian Findlay Path Fund.</p>
<p>This grant funding for “A short path with a big impact’, has allowed the university, with support from East Lothian Council, to invest in making the route more accessible to all.</p>
<p>Work on the path involved removing physical barriers, resurfacing, new lighting and drainage. The result is a path that is accessible to all and resilient to poor weather and flooding.</p>
<p>Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings, Active Travel and Tenants' Rights, Patrick Harvie MSP, said: “I’m really pleased to be able to visit this project which has been made possible through grant funding provided by the Ian Findlay Path Fund (IFPF).</p>
<p>“Ian would have been enthused by the projects coming forward through the fund and that it continues to support communities across the country to put their ideas for local walking and cycling infrastructure into practice, and encourage more people to choose active forms of travel for their everyday journeys.</p>
<p>“This new path will not only help staff and students to travel in a more sustainable way, but also provides a safe and accessible connection to the wider National Cycle Network for surrounding communities.”</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University applied to the Ian Findlay Path Fund last year and was one of 22 successful projects to be offered funding and support to improve active travel networks in their area.  Most of those projects are now reaching their conclusion, delivering improvements for communities all around the country. </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="As a university with sustainability central to our values, this new accessible path that helps our students and staff travel to and from the University safely, without the need for a car, is a huge benefit. Importantly, we know that it will also help people living around the campus. It&#x27;s been great seeing this project develop first-hand, knowing the positive impact it will have for our community and the surrounding area." source="Professor Richard Butt" sourceExtra="Deputy Principal of Queen Margaret University" />
<p>East Lothian Depute Provost, Andy Forrest, said:  “In recent years more people have expressed an interest in active travel both within and to our towns and villages. This new route offers a safe path segregated from traffic for people to walk or cycle to parts of Musselburgh connecting with the QMU campus.”</p>

<p>Senior Development Officer for the fund, Yvonne McLeod, said: “The Ian Findlay Path Fund team has been delighted to be able to support this project and it is fantastic to see the finished path being put to such great use. </p>
<p>“The purpose of the fund is to support community projects just like this one and it has been great to witness this fantastic example of team work between the University and the Local Authority which has allowed this path to be upgraded to such a high standard.</p>
<p>“Seldom has a project been so well named  and we hope the newly refurbished path will continue to have a ‘big impact’ for this community, well into the future.”</p>
<p>CEO of Paths for All, Kevin Lafferty, said: “The QMU path has meant that people of all abilities can get outside, be safe and get exercise while commuting on routes that are used on a daily basis.</p>
<p>“Delivering safe environments for active travel is at the forefront of our Paths for All objectives, supporting people to live active healthy lives. The success from QMU’s use of the funding shows the differences that path development can make for communities."</p>

<p>The fund concluded its second round of awards to community-based groups on the 8<sup>th</sup> March and a further £1.5 million will be allocated to similar path improvement projects located all around Scotland.</p>
<p>The Ian Findlay Path Fund, established in memory of Ian Findlay CBE, the late Chief Officer of Paths for All, continues to support local initiatives aimed at enhancing path networks and removing barriers to active travel.</p>
<p>The team works directly with communities to improve local path networks that will make it easier and more attractive for people to walk, wheel and cycle or choose public transport for local everyday journeys.</p>
<p>Community groups interested in potential future funding can reach out to the Ian Findlay Path Fund team at IFPF@pathforall.org.uk.</p>
