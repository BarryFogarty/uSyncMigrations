<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>As indicated above, QMU values academic collaboration as a key aspect of its academic strategy, and recognises the benefits of such collaboration, both to the institution and to its students.</p>
<p>In this context, QMU will seek to engage with a range of relevant and appropriate national and international partners whose work is complementary to that of QMU, whose values match those of QMU, and which bring benefits to staff and students of both partners.</p>
<p>In seeking academic collaboration, QMU emphasises the importance of establishing and maintaining partnerships in which relationships are balanced, with collaborative partners encouraged to derive equal benefit from the partnership and to contribute fully in joint decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Working with UK based educational partners will enable QMU to: develop stronger articulation links and joint educational programmes with Further Education in pursuit of its access policies; strengthen and diversify educational programmes through the synergies developed across partnerships with Higher Education; and develop routes to CPD and life long learning through partnerships with other organisations involved in training.</p>
<p>Partnerships with public and private sector organisations in the UK will allow QMU to work at the interface of professional research-led practices and contemporary approaches to pedagogy.</p>
<p>Partnerships with international organisations will facilitate the internationalisation of QMU’s educational programmes and research.</p>
<p>The scope, complexity and volume of collaboration bring new challenges and intensify existing ones. Principal amongst these are the need to safeguard the broader cultural, social and economic contributions of higher education and research; protect the interests of students while facilitating their mobility and preserving cultural diversity within higher education.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>QMU believes that academic collaboration can make an important contribution to enhancing higher education if it is developed and delivered responsibly and effectively. It should strive to contribute to the broader economic, social and cultural well-being of communities, and in the case of international collaboration, should be sensitive in its approach and content, strengthening local higher education capacity by, for example, cooperating, with local institutions. It is recognised therefore that such collaborative activity is time limited.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>It will also provide comparable standards of academic quality no matter where it is delivered, and will expand the opportunities for mobility of staff and students.</p>
<p>QMU also recognises the benefits to students of academic partnership through: the promotion of articulated access, lifelong learning opportunities and CPD routes. International collaboration supports the internationalisation of its educational programmes. Collaboration with public and private sector organisations supports the development of awards that are relevant to research informed professional practice.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">The Selection of Relevant and Appropriate Partners</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>QMU recognises the benefits and risk associated with academic collaboration. Success depends upon working within available resources, managing risks, and identifying synergies with the potential UK or International partner. Considerable emphasis is placed on the selection of relevant and appropriate partners.</p>
<p>In approving a collaborative partnership, the institution requires to be assured of the following principles, which should be scrutinised by the Portfolio Development Group before moving to the programme planning stage:</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ol>
<li>
<p>that the activities of the proposed collaboration provide a close fit with the vision and strategic plan of QMU and with the operational plan of the School, Institute or Centre;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the proposed collaboration contributes to strategic targets related to academic provision, research or knowledge transfer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the proposed collaboration has been incorporated into the operational plan of the relevant School, Institute or Centre;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the discipline or subject area of the proposed collaboration falls within QMU’s current or developing areas of expertise;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the educational mission and aims of the partner are consonant with those of QMU;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the partner is of good academic standing and financially stable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the partner is in a position to contract legally with the University;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the partner institution has robust and complementary systems of academic regulations, quality assurance and staffing policies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the partner institution has sufficient facilities to ensure that appropriate arrangements for student support are in place, broadly equivalent to those provided at QMU.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The above points should be covered by the Risk Assessment and Evaluation Report (see below).</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>sed partner are clearly demonstrated and appropriately costed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the collaborative programme can be delivered on the basis of an income stream that supports full-economic costs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Where these principles do not apply in totality, the collaboration may still be approved. However, the basis of that approval must be minuted by the Portfolio Development Group, which should also provide details of the basis on which the collaboration can achieve the spirit of the mission/vision statement and the steps which are to be taken to ameliorate the impact of any aspects of the above principles with which the proposal is not fully compliant.</p>

class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A Franchise arrangement is the process by which Queen Margaret University authorises the provision of the whole or part of one or more of its own approved programmes by a partner institution. In doing so, Queen Margaret University retains overall control of the programme’s content, delivery, assessment and quality assurance arrangements. The approval of such programmes will be conducted through the University’s established procedures and a Memorandum of Agreement will be required. If a complete award is franchised, changes to the parent programme made at the point of review, or approved by the School Academic Board between review events, must be reflected in the franchise version. If individual modules are franchised, changes in the parent modules approved by the School Academic Board must be reflected in changes to the franchise version.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A Validated programme is developed and delivered by the staff of a partner institution. Whilst some aspects of programme management may be delegated to the partner institution, Queen Margaret University retains ultimate responsibility for the standard of awards made in its name. The validated programme will normally be in a subject linked to Queen Margaret University’s own portfolio but the partner may provide specialist expertise. The approval of such programmes will be conductedthrough Queen Margaret University’s established procedures. The award will be conferred by Queen Margaret University and a Memorandum of Agreement will be required.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A Joint award is a programme designed and/or delivered and/or assessed by the staff of Queen Margaret University and one or more partner institutions, where each of the partners has the power to make the award in question. The approval of such programmes will be conducted through the established procedures of the University and the partner institution(s). The programme will be subject to the quality assurance and quality control process of Queen Margaret University and the partner institution(s). The award will normally be jointly conferred by Queen Margaret University and the partner institution(s). A Memorandum of Agreement will be required. In a Joint award a single certificate is issued to successful graduates, bearing the crests of each partner. In some cases, there may be legal or regulatory barriers to the issue of a single certificate. In this case each partner will issue its own certificate but the wording on the certificates will cross-refer to the other partner(s) in order to make clear the nature of the collaborative arrangement. This is normally known as a Double award or (if three or more partners are involved) a Multiple award. See Section 14 for more information.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A Dual Award normally refers to an arrangement in which the student studies partly at each partner institution and uses the credits from one partner’s programme towards the other partner’s award (or from both awards towards the other). Each degree- awarding body is responsible for its own award. Students who successfully complete the two programmes receive separate certificates, one for each of the qualifications being granted by each of the awarding bodies involved. A distinguishing feature of this type of arrangement is that it is possible for the student to meet the requirements for one award without meeting the requirements for the other. By combining related awards in this way a student may achieve two certificates in a shorter period of time than if each were studied separately. See Section 14 for more information.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Articulation is a particular form of formal credit-rating and transfer agreement between Queen Margaret University and another institution, and will involve Queen Margaret University recognising and granting specific credit or advanced standing to applicants from a named programme of study pursued in the other institution. For example, an HNC at College A, gives direct access to Year 2 of a specific Queen Margaret University programme. This is not accreditation of prior learning (APL) as an articulation agreement does not allow for the individual assessment of Queen Margaret University applicants. An articulation agreement will be required.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The following procedures apply in full to franchised, joint, dual and validated programmes that result in an award in the name of Queen Margaret University. There will be an element of discretion in terms of their application to articulation agreements.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The following procedures are an extension of, and should be read in conjunction with, those established in the Programme development, monitoring and review chapter. Collaborative arrangements require that those procedures be expanded upon to allow for full consideration of the proposed collaborative link.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

<p><span class="lead">QMU Policy on Academic Collaboration</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Context </span></p>
<p>QMU acknowledges the important role that academic collaboration plays in achieving aspects of its mission statement that relate both to serving its communities and to being an outward looking institution. These aspects of the mission are supported by the vision statement which identifies the centrality of collaboration with institutions within and beyond the educational sector. Our QM150 Strategy states that we will be “A university without borders that embraces partnership working with the local, national and international communities.”</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This policy on academic collaboration is designed both to focus and facilitate the development of relevant and appropriate academic partnerships within the UK and internationally. These include, but are not limited to, UK educational providers (both FE and HE); UK organisations (both public and private sector); international educational providers; and international organisations. Within the context of this policy, the interpretation of relevance and appropriateness is addressed in Section three below.</p>
