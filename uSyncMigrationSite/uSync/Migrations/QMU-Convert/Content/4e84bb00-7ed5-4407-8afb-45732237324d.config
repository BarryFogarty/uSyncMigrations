      <Value><![CDATA[<p>2.2      If programmes or awards are proposed together, they will be considered independently. Therefore, if one is successful that does not imply that all will be successful.</p>
<p>A summary of the stages in developing new programmes is set out below. Note that these arrangements apply only to full programmes leading to an award of the University. Separate arrangements apply to Short Programmes leading to the award of credit for CPD purposes, as set out in paragraph 12 below. Provision that does not lead to the award of credit is managed as a consultancy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial discussions and confirmation of support from Dean and Head of Division.</li>
<li>Submission of stage one of the Programme Development Form to the School Executive Board.</li>
<li>Submission of stage two of the Programme Development Form, including costing to the Academic Planning Board.</li>
<li>Submission of stage three of the Programme Development Form to the School Academic Board – the proposed new programme may be advertised as ‘subject to validation’ only once the Board has considered and agreed the academic rationale.</li>
<li>Proposal reported to Senate through the School Academic Board minutes. Senate has final authority to approve the development of new programmes.</li>
<li>The Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement confirms date for validation.</li>
<li>Development of validation documentation; Panel established Documents submitted to the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement four weeks prior to event.</li>
<li>Validation event</li>
<li>Recommendations from Panel reported to the Student Experience Committee, which advises Senate on approval. Senate has final authority to approve all new programmes and continuation of programmes presented for review.</li>

The Dean will confirm whether the proposal fits with the University Strategic Plan and School Operational Plan and priority areas for growing student numbers. For in-house programmes, the Dean will also want an indication of whether the programme can be delivered from within the current staff resources of the School. If the Dean and Head of Division are satisfied that the proposal is worth pursuing, they should identify a member of QMU staff to act as provisional Programme Leader. The proposal should be included in the School Operational Plan and reported to the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement. No proposal for a new programme may proceed without the support of both the Dean and Head of Division.</p>\n<p>2.5   Once initial support has been secured, the proposal can proceed to stage one of the three stage programme approval process. <strong>To allow for marketing and inclusion in the prospectus, new undergraduate programmes should have completed stage three approval through the School Academic Board 22 months before the start of the academic year in which the programme is due to commence, and postgraduate programmes 18 months before the start of the academic year in which the programme is due to commence.</strong></p>"

As a matter of course, the Programme Leader/Academic Link Person should contact the Liaison Services Manager in the Library before finalising costings. Estates and Facilities must be contacted regarding any requirements for specialist teaching space or equipment. The Assistant Secretaries, Registry and Academic Administration, and External Liaison and Student Services, must be consulted at the costing stage to reflect the level of input that will be required from their Divisions. Programme Leaders should also liaise with Marketing and Communications to allow for early planning in relation to website and prospectus entries.</p>\n<p>2.13    Constraints affecting the introduction of new programmes may include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consolidation of funded student numbers in each of QMU’s subject categories by level (i.e. undergraduate, taught postgraduate, research);</li>\n<li>Availability of appropriate space;</li>\n<li>Availability of teaching staff;</li>\n<li>Evidence of demand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.14     The Academic Planning Board will only accept stage two paperwork that has been approved by the following people: Dean(s) of contributing Schools; University Secretary; Director of Operations and Finance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span>[1]</span></a> The nature of evidence used to show demand will vary from programme to programme</p>"

The Secretary to the Panel is also responsible for notifying the above people of any significant changes that arise through the response to conditions process, for example title change, or removal of core modules.</p>\n<p>2.20    The Dean of School is responsible for approving the content of all advertising materials. This responsibility may be delegated, as the Dean considers appropriate. All published information on University programmes must comply with legislation issued by the Competition and Marketing Authority (CMA). This means that all advertising and other materials must be clear, comprehensive, accurate, and timely, at all stages of the student journey, including the research and application period. No information should be advertised until core modules, content and structure and fees are finalised. Marketing can advise on appropriate content.</p>"
