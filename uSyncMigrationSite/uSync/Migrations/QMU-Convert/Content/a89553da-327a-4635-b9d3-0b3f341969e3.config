      "title": "3\tStatutory background",
      "content": "<p>The UK Bribery Act 2010 sets out four general bribery offences. These relate to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Circumstances involving bribing another;</li>\n<li>Circumstances involving being bribed;</li>\n<li>A failure by a commercial organisation to prevent bribery;</li>\n<li>Bribery of foreign public officials.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A briefing paper produced by the UK HE International Unit, titled ‘A Legal Guide to UK Anti-Bribery and Corruption’, provides further guidance on these provisions.</p>\n<p>Active bribery, that is bribing another, ‘is the giving, promising or offering of a bribe with intent to induce improper conduct by the recipient of the bribe. This extends to both cash and non-cash benefits.’</p>\n<p>Passive bribery, that is being bribed, ‘is the requesting, accepting or agreeing to receive a payment or other advantage in return for the improper performance of a function or activity. The offence is committed even if the person requesting the bribe does not benefit personally.’</p>\n<p>In relation to the offence around failure to prevent bribery in a commercial organisation, the briefing paper states that:</p>\n<p>‘This offence is one of strict liability meaning that, if the HEI fails to prevent an Associated Person from paying a bribe for its benefit (active bribery only), the offence is committed regardless of knowledge or intention. It is irrelevant that the HEI was unaware of the bribe being paid. This offence does not include any notion of improper conduct. It simply requires a payment or other advantage for the winning or retention of business.’</p>\n<p>There is a defence available where the University can demonstrate that there were adequate procedures in place to minimise the risk of bribery occurring.</p>\n<p>The offence concerning foreign public officials requires that the HEI or third party intermediary actively bribes a foreign public official in their capacity as such with the intention of retaining or creating business for the HEI.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>a) Corporate Risk Register</strong></p>\n<p>Effective risk assessment lies at the core of the success or failure of this policy as it identifies the specific areas where the University is exposed to the risk of bribery, allows those risks to be evaluated and appropriate risk mitigation to be put in place.</p>\n<p>The University Corporate Risk Register is reviewed quarterly by the Strategic Leadership Team (SLT), at which time, each member of the SLT is required to review the adequacy and appropriateness of their local risk registers, and to identify any risks that are sufficiently serious to require them to be escalated and included in the University level Corporate Risk Register. However, risk assessment must be a continuous process. Schools and professional services departments need to ensure that they continue to review, monitor and repeat risk assessments (including the risk of bribery) as the business evolves and external circumstances change.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>b) Gifts, Gratuities and Hospitality</strong></p>\n<p>The procedures governing the acceptance of gifts and hospitality are detailed in the Gifts, Gratuities and Hospitality Policy, and in Section 11 of the University Financial Regulations.</p>\n<p>The University gift and hospitality register is held in the office of the Director of Operations &amp; Finance . Any member of staff in receipt of any gift or hospitality, must record such receipt and advise the office of the Director of Operations &amp; Finance. The receipt will be recorded and entered into the University gifts and hospitality register.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>c) Donations</strong></p>\n<p>All donations receivable by the University will be subject to an approval process that asks specific questions related to the purpose of the gift and the bona fides of the organisation or individual offering the donation. The Deputy Principal is responsible for ensuring that appropriate checks have been carried out before any donation is accepted. Authority for accepting any individual donation with a value in excess of £500,000 remains with the University Court. No donations will be accepted where it is known that the individual is desirous of a University award or honour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>d) Register of Interests</strong></p>\n<p>Section 11 of the University’s Financial Regulations (“Code of Conduct”) sets out the procedure to be followed in the event that a senior member of University staff or a member of the University Court is aware that he/she has any interest, financial or otherwise, which is likely to or would, if publicly known, be perceived as being likely to influence the exercise of independent judgement.</p>\n<p>Members of the University Court, members of the Senior Leadership Team and Heads of Division and Department are required to make an annual declaration setting out their personal interests. This includes details of business interests, company directorships, trusteeships and memberships of organisations or public bodies where they have a position of general management or control. Any such interests held by a member of their immediate family (spouse/partner, siblings, children or parents) must also be disclosed.</p>\n<p>The Register of Interests is reviewed by the University Secretary’s Office at least annually. The interests of members of the University Court and members of the Senior Leadership Team are published on the University website.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>e) Procurement of Services</strong></p>\n<p>The procedures governing services procured from a third party are set out in section 21 of the University’s Financial Regulations.</p>\n<p>All contracts must include a standard anti-bribery clause.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>f) Agency Agreements</strong></p>\n<p>All agency agreements and contracts must include a standard anti-bribery clause.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>g) Public Interest Disclosure Policy</strong></p>\n<p>The University’s Public Interest Disclosure Policy (‘Whistleblowing’) provides a channel through which staff can raise concerns and report alleged breaches, in confidence.</p>"

The University will act to ensure that staff, members of the University Court and those organisations that work on the University’s behalf are made aware of the University’s Anti-Bribery Policy, and the University’s Public Interest Disclosure Policy (‘Whistleblowing’).</p>\n<p>The implementation strategy comprises the following steps:</p>\n<p>An e-learning module on the Bribery Act 2010 is available for all staff, and training records maintained and reviewed regularly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All staff and external bodies, including agents, contractors and suppliers working on the University’s behalf, will be made aware of the University’s Anti-Bribery Policy.</li>\n<li>The Anti-Bribery Policy will be published on the University website.</li>\n<li>Training provided to all staff will ensure that they are aware, not only of their obligations and responsibilities under the Act, but of the consequences of breaching those obligations and responsibilities.  </li>\n<li>To comply with the University’s Anti-Bribery Policy, employees will carry out appropriate due diligence checks before engaging agents, suppliers and other third parties. Examples of relevant evidence will include negative news reports, warnings or sanctions involving the potential business partner, as well as any association with politically exposed persons, which may present an increased risk of bribery and corruption.</li>\n<li>Additional due diligence will be exercised for high-risk third parties, including agents, external-facing consultants, distributors, third parties interacting with government officials and those operating in high-risk markets.</li>\n<li>Deans and Heads of professional support services are responsible for ensuring that properly documented due diligence is undertaken. General oversight after the contract is signed must also be undertaken.</li>\n<li>As the Act also applies to “associated persons” such as agents, suppliers and contractors, staff must ensure that, during the due diligence process, checks are made to establish whether external organisations have any equivalent anti-bribery policies or training in place. If no such policy is in place, the “associated person” must be advised of the University’s requirements, that is, that the University expects them to acknowledge and observe the University’s Anti-Bribery Policy and that failure to adhere to this will result in the University exercising its option to terminate the contract or agreement.</li>\n<li>Where a report raises a concern, this must be discussed with the Dean or Head of Department, and highlighted clearly in the documented due diligence report to be submitted to the Senior Leadership Team. Where concerns cannot be mitigated, this will result in the relationship or third party transaction not progressing.</li>\n<li>All interactions with associated parties must be clearly documented.</li>\n<li>All proposed agreements with agents and other intermediaries must have the prior approval of the relevant member of the Senior Leadership Team, in line with the delegated authority schedule.</li>\n<li>Any breach of the Act by a member of staff will be treated as a disciplinary matter, independent of legal sanction.</li>\n<li>The Students’ Association is responsible for ensuring its staff and students are aware of their responsibilities to comply with the University’s Anti-Bribery Policy and associated procedures</li>\n</ul>"
