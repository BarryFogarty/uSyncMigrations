The information you supply on your FAFSA is used to calculate your EFC (Expected Family Contribution). Your EFC and the amount of your EFA, (Estimated Financial Assistance i.e.any scholarships, bursaries or awards you will receive) will be deducted from your Cost of Attendance to determine your Financial Need. Please note that Graduate/Professional students are no longer eligible for the subsidised element of the Stafford Loan.</p>\n<p>The US government will pay the interest on a subsidised loan while you are enrolled at least half time or during a grace or deferment period.</p>\n<p><strong>Stafford Loan (Unsubsidised)<br /></strong>This is not based on financial need. Whilst studying at least half time, or during deferment or grace periods you have the option of paying the interest or having it capitalised and added to the total value of the loan therefore increasing the amount you need to repay.</p>\n<p><strong>Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan<br /></strong>Parents of dependent undergraduate students can borrow a federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan and can borrow up to the total Cost of Attendance minus all other sources of financial aid their student receives. The loan is the financial responsibility of the parents and not the student.</p>\n<p>A parent PLUS loan borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as the student. The parent must not owe a refund on a federal student financial aid grant or be in default on a federal student loan. Repayment begins within 60 days after your loan is fully disbursed and lasts ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan</strong></p>\n<p>The Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan is a federal loan that graduate students with good credit histories may borrow to help pay their educational expenses. A graduate student may borrow up to the total Cost of Attendance less all other financial aid received.</p>\n<p>Students must have applied for their annual loan maximum eligibility under the Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loan Program before applying for a Graduate/Professional PLUS loan.</p>\n<p>Repayment begins on the date of the last disbursement of the loan and the first payment is due within 60 days after the date the loan is fully disbursed. Graduate PLUS borrowers may receive a deferment while he or she is enrolled on at least a half-time basis at an eligible school.</p>\n<p><strong>Private<br /></strong>A private loan is a non-federal loan through a private lender and is usually in the student’s name and requires a cosigner.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students who have been classed as Independant on their FAFSA would need to take up this type of loan if they need to borrow more that the Stafford Loan limits.</p>"
