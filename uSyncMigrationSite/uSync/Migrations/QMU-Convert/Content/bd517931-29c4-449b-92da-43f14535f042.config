Our Principal, Sir Paul Grice, and Dr Lindesay Irvine, who was instrumental in setting up the Lydia Osteoporosis Project, will talk about the history and impact of LOP at Queen Margaret University.<br>Find out more about our amazing line up of speakers <a href=\"/news-and-events/events-listing/lydia-plus-symposium/\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Practical sessions will include a cook-off featuring bone-healthy recipes and there will also be a chance to try out some physical activities for bone health – balance exercises, a Scottish stepdance taster session, and a demonstration of the weight lifting exercises from the LIFTMOR trials.<br><br>A day not to be missed!</p>"
