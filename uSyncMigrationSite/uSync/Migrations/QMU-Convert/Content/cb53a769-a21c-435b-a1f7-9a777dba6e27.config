      "content": "<p>Communication, media, and culture not only shape people’s lives but are also pivotal to the way in which politics and policymaking work. Companies and brands have recognised this for some time now in their lobbying, advocacy, and social responsibility work. In this age of activism, so have ordinary people when they mobilise to advocate for ways—laws and policies—to change how governments and companies go about their business. There is politics (and policy) in the food we eat, in the education we get, in how we travel, how we build homes, in who makes our clothes and what happens to them when we no longer use them. And this is what this course is about.</p>\n<p>We recognise the growing importance of specialist skills that combine communication with strategic management, and an understanding of public affairs, that is issues of interest to the public. Many organisations, from huge corporations to grassroots organisations, rely on public affairs specialists to be able to conduct their activities, to look after their reputation and, most importantly, to have a say in how the world is shaped by what governments and legislators do.</p>\n<p>Students will develop communication expertise that combines strategic communication with an understanding of policy communication in the contemporary media landscape.</p>\n<p>As you will learn, not all people who do these jobs think of themselves as public affairs specialists, some may be called policy officers, or public engagement managers, but whatever the job title, there are core competencies that you need, and that you will start developing with our help.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Structure and exit awards</strong></p>\n<p>You can opt to study for the full MSc (180 credits), a PgDip (120 credits) or a PgCert (60 credits). Whatever award you choose to study for, all students complete three core modules, on which they build further by choosing additional modules to achieve the required credits.</p>\n<p>You can also register as an associate student to complete a single module for CPD. On completion of a single module, you may wish to complete further modules and progress your studies to a named award. <a href=\"mailto:%20mpieczka@qmu.ac.uk\">Contact Magda Pieczka</a> for more information on single study.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Students learn from an academic team that includes internationally published researchers and practitioners with years of professional experience. In many modules, students learn alongside and network with practitioners working in communication and public relations roles.</p>\n<p>Teaching comprises a combination of lectures, seminars, workshops, and tutorials. Teaching involves face-to-face and directed learning as well as your own self-directed activity. Face-to-face teaching is delivered on campus.</p>\n<p>Core module assessments may include case studies, essays, projects, blogs, proposals, campaign materials and briefing documents of between 1,000 and 5,000 words. There is also a dissertation (12,000 words). Many of these assessments can contribute to a portfolio that will support your search for employment.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements/industry-based learning</strong></p>\n<p>You can choose to do 150 hours on placement or other forms of experiential learning such as a work-based project, freelance working, development of a professional portfolio, or volunteering. Many of our students find that this is a very valuable option that helps expand their learning and build personal connections. If relevant, you can arrange to do this with your current employer. While it is students’ responsibility to secure the placement and arrange their own experiential learning, QMU provides support. We are proud of our strong links with organisations and industry partners, many of which agree to be placement hosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>We timetable most teaching to take place on Fridays and Saturdays to enable people in full-time work or with caring responsibilities to take part. Your specific timetable will depend on the electives you choose and whether you study full-time or part-time.</p>\n<p>The two taught semesters run from September to December and mid-January to mid-April. Assessments are mostly due at the end of each semester. Full-time students attend classes for two semesters and then submit their dissertation/project in August. Part-time students normally attend classes for four semesters and then complete their dissertation.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Class sizes will depend on the modules chosen but will normally be between 15 and 30 students.</p>"
