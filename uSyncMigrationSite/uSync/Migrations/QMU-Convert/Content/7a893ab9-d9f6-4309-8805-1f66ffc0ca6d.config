      "title": "Investigating patterns in foot drop presentation and optimisation of orthotic device prescription [BUR 24-01]",
      "content": "<p>There are numerous causes of foot drop. Examples include Multiple Sclerosis, Stroke, Cerebral Palsy and Peripheral Neuropathy (Miller et al., 2016). Foot drop has negative effects on walking and can lead to trips and falls, with substantial impacts on quality of life (Prenton et al., 2018). Foot drop is complex and influenced by multiple factors. Most published research on foot drop focuses on the effectiveness or experience of using interventions to achieve orthotic and/or therapeutic improvements in walking, such as Functional Electrical Stimulation and Ankle Foot Orthoses (van der Linden et al., 2014; Bulley et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>The involvement of CHEARR researchers in this area has led to innovation and KE activity. A new device has been developed to support people with foot drop - footwear with inbuilt dorsiflexion support. The Health Design Collective (spin-out Social Enterprise) team have tested multiple prototypes and submitted a patent relating to this innovation. As a team we have now reached the point of evaluating the footwear in comparison with other devices for supporting foot drop. As for previous research, evaluation of the footwear innovation is affected by substantial heterogeneity in the presentation of foot drop, with numerous influencing factors.</p>\n<p>Further research is needed into the multifactorial nature of foot drop to support development and prescription of appropriate interventions. While there are many devices available to support people who have foot drop, more knowledge is needed to enable development of a classification system and guidance which will inform people about what may or may not work for them depending on the characteristics of their foot drop, for example, in relation to muscle strength/activation, range of motion and spasticity. A system allows input of information about the impacts or characteristics of a person’s foot drop and provides guidance about the best options for support would enable people to make more informed decisions in relation to footwear and orthotic interventions. This would support both clinical and self-management for people with foot drop. In order to address this gap and support the progression of work within CHEARR, we propose the following research questions:</p>\n<p><strong>Example research questions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there common patterns in foot drop presentation derived from measurements of range of motion, spasticity, strength, fatigability and gait?</li>\n<li>Are there associations between the impacts of different orthotic devices and different patterns of foot drop presentation?</li>\n<li>Is it possible to create a classification system in relation to foot drop presentation and can this be used to support decision making relating to the most appropriate orthotic device prescription?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This work will be carried out within the QMU Centre for Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research (CHEARR). It has emerged from research and innovation activities that have been ongoing for many years and benefits from ongoing health sector and commercial collaborations. We welcome applications from people with qualifications as a health professional, sports and exercise scientist, or relating to biomechanics or bioengineering.</p>\n<p><strong>References </strong></p>\n<p>Bulley C, Meagher C, Street T, Adonis A, Peace C, Singleton C, Burridge J.

      "title": "Factors affecting the uptake and adherence to prehabilitation before surgery when delivered via a mobile health (mhealth) application. [BUR 24-02]",
      "content": "<p>Prehabilitation is an intervention delivered to prevent or reduce subsequent injury or complications and this concept has been adopted for individuals prior to surgery to improve and optimise their functional ability. Prehabilitation before surgery provides patients with a functional reserve to help them withstand the stresses of surgery resulting in improved outcomes including a reduction in the rate of post-operative complications, a reduced hospital length of stay and a reduction in the associated hospital costs (Hughes et al, 2019). Current prehabilitation programmes are predominantly hospital based, which is a major barrier to delivery because of the staff, space and cost implications. Hospital based delivery is also not suitable for patients who are immunosuppressed or with long commuting distances. These financial, geographical and health constraints exist in most regions within the UK and limit the availability of prehabilitation programmes. The adoption of digital methods to deliver rehabilitation, including prehabilitation, has been gaining attention and accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>However, there is a lack of consensus around the factors that impact on the uptake and adherence to mhealth applications in healthcare settings and yet this is critical to ensure effective, cost-effective delivery of health in a digital format. A scoping review undertaken by Ryan et al (2017) explored adherence with web-based interventions and concluded that an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating a range of technological, environmental and individual factors, needed to be considered to comprehensively explain user adherence. This PhD bursary will explore the factors affecting uptake and adherence to digitally delivered prehabilitation, using mhealth, before Gastrointestinal (GI) surgery.</p>\n<p>Example research questions:</p>\n<p>How can adherence to prehabilitation before GI surgery using an mhealth application be defined?</p>\n<p>What factors affect the uptake of prehabilitation delivered via mhealth before GI surgery?</p>\n<p>What factors affect the adherence to an mhealth prehabilitation intervention before GI surgery?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The QMU Centre for Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research (CHEARR) has a growing programme of research evaluating the implementation of mhealth and offers a strong background and environment for the evaluation of rehabilitation and health interventions using a range of different methodological approaches. We welcome applications from individuals who bring a theoretical perspective to inform and evaluate ‘real life’ implementation of mhealth in prehabilitation before GI surgery. This could include individuals from a psychology/health psychology background or health care professionals with experience/expertise in this area.</p>\n<p><strong>References </strong></p>\n<p>Hughes MJ, Hackney RJ, Lamb PJ, Wigmore SJ, Deans DAC &amp; Skipworth RJE.
