      "title": " How does the scheme work?",
      "content": "<p>If you choose to participate in the scheme, your employer will provide you with a bicycle or cycle equipment on loan in return for you agreeing to receive a reduced level of pay for the Period. Your employer agrees to provide you with the free use of the bicycle for that period. This is a tax free benefit and this nominated amount will not be subject to Tax or National Insurance deductions.</p>\n<p>A Salary sacrifice is a legally binding change in the contractual arrangements between employee and employer. Generally, the employment contract is amended to reduce the employee's entitlement to cash pay on the basis that the employee receives an alternate non-cash benefit instead.</p>\n<p>At the end of the hire period, your employer may seek to dispose of the bicycle equipment at a full market value. But please note that this cannot be guaranteed until the end of the hire period. It is common in such circumstances to offer to sell the equipment to the person who has had the equipment on hire. However, you should be aware that such practice and expectations are merely indications based on historical factors and cannot be guaranteed for the future. Any subsequent sale would also be pursuant to a separate agreement, entered into after the conclusion of the hire.</p>\n<p>HMRC have recently issued new guide lines about handling full market value. These guidelines provide clarification and a valuation matrix which employers may use to value the bicycle. Please follow this link for more details. For more information please contact your employer as they do have options regarding the Full Market Value payment at the end of the scheme. For example, as detailed elsewhere in these<br />pages, they may just allow you to continue to use the bicycle without transferring the ownership over to you.</p>\n<p>In order to benefit from the Tax and National Insurance savings the bicycle must be used for a minimum of 50% of the time for journeys to and from work or between work sites.</p>"

Please note that your employer cannot guarantee it will sell the bicycle/equipment to the person who has hired them but historically this is often the case. Any subsequent sale would also be pursuant to a separate agreement, entered into after the conclusion of the hire.<br />HMRC have recently issued new guide lines about handling full market value. These guidelines provide clarification and a valuation matrix which employers may use to value the bicycle. Please follow this link for more details.</p>\n<p>For more information please contact your employer as they do have options regarding the Full Market Value payment at the end of the scheme. For example, as detailed elsewhere in these pages, they may just allow you to continue to use the bicycle without transferring the ownership over to you.</p>"
