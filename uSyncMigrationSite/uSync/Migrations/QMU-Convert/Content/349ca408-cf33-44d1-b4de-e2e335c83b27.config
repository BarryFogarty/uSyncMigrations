<p>This Code of Conduct has been developed to provide clear guidelines of acceptable behaviour. This general set of Principles is supported by more detailed Codes of Conduct specifically relating to Halls of Residence, Library, Learning Environments and IT facilities.</p>
<p><strong>It is expected that all students will wish to support and actively implement this Code of Conduct.</strong></p>
<p>This Code of Conduct should be read in conjunction with the following:</p>

<p><span class="lead">Students' Union Endorsement</span></p>
<p>The Students’ Union has worked closely with the University in providing this Code of Conduct for all students. The Students’ Union fully supports this Code of Conduct because we believe this will help create a better learning and working environment whilst also ensuring a safe and enjoyable place to live. The Students’ Union will also use this Code of Conduct for all activities undertaken by the Union and will use it in conjunction with our own Disciplinary Procedures should an incident take place within the Union or whilst representing the Students’ Union if the Union deems it necessary.</p>]]></Value>
