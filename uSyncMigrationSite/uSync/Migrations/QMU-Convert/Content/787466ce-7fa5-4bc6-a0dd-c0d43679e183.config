      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The new programme of educational and practice-relevant study will suit people who wish to enhance their knowledge and practice in their specialist areas. The new Advancing Practice in Health Framework is designed for people who are looking for flexible postgraduate study routes and will be particularly attractive to individuals who are passionate about making a difference to the lives of others in communities across Scotland and at a national level. Individuals who aspire to develop as leaders with global impact can also use Master’s study opportunities within the Framework to support them in achieving their career goals.</p>
<p>Professor Jackie Waterfield, from QMU’s Division of Health Sciences, explained: “We have developed this new Framework to better service the needs of health professionals including medical practitioners, pharmacists, nurses, allied health professionals, nutritionists and professionals in areas such as public health, the community and the voluntary sector. Offering part-time, full-time and work-place learning routes provides professionals with more choice as to how they blend their continuing professional development and career enhancing opportunities within their lives.</p>
<p>“Due to work and personal responsibilities, people can’t always commit to a full Master’s degree but this new Framework will allow people to start with a single module. They may then wish to further develop their study by adding another module with the possibility of building up towards a  postgraduate diploma or master’s degree. Others may wish to take modules as part of their continuing professional development and enhance their current roles. We recognise that careers evolve over time, so we are pleased that our Framework will facilitate a more personalised learning pathway which can lead to PgCert/PgDip/MSc Advancing Practice in Health awards.”</p>
<p>Professor Waterfield continued: “As all modules, postgraduate diplomas and master’s courses within the Framework will be offered by distance learning, more people from across the UK will be able to take advantage of postgraduate-level learning at QMU. We are also keen to discuss education requirements of international applicants who wish to develop specialist skills and knowledge in key areas of healthcare.”</p>
<p>Professor Fiona Coutts, Dean of the School of Health Sciences, said: “To further support the educational needs of health and care practitioners, we have launched the School of Health Sciences, Advancing Practice Academy. Our unique multi-professional learning environment offers postgraduate education for all allied health professionals and nurses to advance their knowledge and skills together in the four pillars of practice: clinical practice, facilitating learning, leadership and research.  Learning is underpinned by person-centred research, evidence and scholarship against a background of the current and evolving political and social landscape for health and wellbeing.”</p>
