      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>BA (Hons) Education Studies (Primary) </strong>will be based within the University’s Division of Psychology and Sociology and will have a social sciences focus. The new course is designed to attract candidates with a strong social conscience, who are passionate about developing young people and equality of opportunity. It will also particularly suit those who have aspirations to lead in the teaching profession.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty places will be available for people who wish to study the undergraduate degree in primary education in the East of Scotland. Successful students, who secure a place on QMU’s new programme, will be based at the University’s modern campus located to the east of Edinburgh by Musselburgh. They will also have the opportunity to participate in a wide range of placements. The University was recently ranked top university in Scotland and third in the UK for employment of graduate leavers.</p>
<p>QMU will be the new provider of undergraduate primary teacher education in Edinburgh and the surrounding area with recruitment for the new programme starting now. The first cohort of 120 students will take their place at QMU in September 2019.</p>
<p>The University has a history of education dating back to its inception in 1875. It was established at a time characterised by social and economic divisions and inequalities, and widespread poverty. It responded, at that time, by creating new education and career opportunities for women and improving the diets of the urban poor. To this day, it remains true to its roots with a commitment to social justice as one of its core values.</p>
<p>Professor Brigid Daniel, Dean of Arts, Social Sciences and Management at Queen Margaret University, explained: “Primary school teachers are some of the most influential people in children’s lives. We recognise the huge responsibility we have to provide the best possible learning experience for our students so that they can become creative, inspiring and nurturing teachers.</p>
<p>“We want to support a new generation of teachers who are socially aware and who challenge their own thinking, and that of others, to improve learning and teaching for Scotland’s young people. With its social sciences focus, our new honours degree programme will suit candidates who want to engage with issues such as inequality, child welfare, child psychology and wellbeing. We also want to recruit students who have a passion for making a difference in the world around them. The University has a particularly strong track record of community engagement and so, as well as placements within schools there will be opportunities for students to gain wider practical experience in the community, such as with refugee centres and specialised settings offering support and therapy for young people with complex needs.”</p>
<p>Professor Daniel confirmed: “In line with QMU’s ethos, we will provide a full rounded education to our students, not simply training: we will prepare them to be autonomous, flexible, adaptable and critically thinking. In other words, we will prepare them for a successful career, not just their first job.”</p>
<p>Professor Petra Wend, Principal of QMU, who was Chair of National Implementation Board for Teaching Scotland’s Future, said: “Teacher education fits with QMU’s strategy of delivering a portfolio of professionally relevant programmes that serve the needs of society. We are already highly experienced in teaching and inspiring Scotland’s young people via our pioneering Academies programme for 14 – 18 year olds and through the Queen Margaret Children’s University for 5 to 14 years olds. We have significant experience in relevant research and knowledge exchange, for example in social policy development, child welfare, resilience and peer education. Our teaching degree will be distinctive in its focus on education in community settings, as well as in schools, and will build on our strong existing collaborations with local and national community organisations. Combining this with our significant experience of dealing with professional bodies, and our history of teaching, it is clear that our new teaching education degree aligns strongly with our strategy, values and experience.”</p>
<p>Returning to its roots in food and nutrition, <a href="/news-and-events/news/20180304-home-economics-teachers-to-be-taught-at-queen-margaret-university/" title="Post graduate degree in home economics press release">QMU will also offer a postgraduate degree in home economics</a>. Twenty places will be available for postgraduate students starting in September 2019.</p>
<p>Professor Wend, continued: “We feel that our compact friendly campus environment where students need not be lost in the crowd, coupled with our approachable and engaging staff and practical application of theory to practice, will appeal to people who wish to make a career in the teaching profession.”</p>
<p>Professor Wend concluded: “Our vision is to be a university of ideas and influence. It is difficult to imagine a more profound way to influence future generations, as well as learning and health outcomes, than educating those who educate our young people.”</p>
