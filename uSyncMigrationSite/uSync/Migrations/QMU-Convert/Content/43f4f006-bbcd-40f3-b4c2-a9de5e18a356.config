      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Problems on Placement</strong></p>
<p>If a student is experiencing difficulties on school experience or needs to discuss any aspect of the placement with a member of academic staff, they are advised to contact their University Based Educator initially. Students may choose to discuss problems of a personal nature with their School Based Educator, or to contact their Personal Academic Tutor (PAT). </p>
<p>However, if an incident occurs outside of normal working hours, where there is an urgent need to contact the University, please telephone: (0131)-474-0000. When prompted, ask for School Office or the Placements team. </p>
<p><strong>Student Wellbeing Service</strong></p>
<p>Students experiencing any personal difficulties during their studies are encouraged to make use of the Wellbeing Service. This service is confidential, and sessions can be arranged to suit his/her timetable. All students are welcome to use the service, which can also provide information on other sources of help that may be more appropriate.  The website also provides signposting to various other <a href="/study-here/student-services/wellbeing-service/" title="Student Wellbeing Service">information and support services</a></p>
<p><strong>School Experience Reflection</strong> <strong>Seminars</strong></p>
<p>School experience placement debriefing workshops, facilitated by the University Based Educators are held at the concluding phase of each placement providing an opportunity to discuss with peers and reflect on their school experience in line with the SPR, enabling them to individually identify strengths and areas of development. </p>
<p><strong>School and School Based Educator Contact Mechanisms and Support</strong></p>
<p>A variety of systems and mechanisms are currently in operation to ensure that support for placement providers and School Based Educators is monitored and continuously reviewed thereby contributing towards enhancement of the experience for all involved.</p>
<p><strong>School Experience Information Support</strong> <strong>Website</strong></p>
<p>A school experience information support website is available for organisations hosting school experience and School Based Educators. The website has been designed to help make the role of School Based Educators easier by providing links to useful websites related to practice- based learning, along with electronic versions of all the handbooks and forms that School-Based Educators need for school experience. The <a href="/current-students/practice-based-learning/" title="School Experience Information Support Website">ITE school-based learning support Home Page</a> </p>
<p><strong>School Experience Briefings and Mentor</strong> <strong>Training</strong></p>
<p>School experience briefings will be held prior to each placement enabling School-Based Educators to gain an overview of the placement, expectations and paperwork; and ask any questions. Briefing information will also be available on the information support website:<a href="/current-students/practice-based-learning/" title="School Experience Information Support Website">ITE school-based learning support Home Page</a> </p>
<p><strong>Individual</strong> <strong>Support</strong></p>
<p>A student’s University Based Educator is available to answer any queries during school experience. Additional support and guidance are available to School Based Educators who are working with marginal students and very able students. Meetings (e.g., face-face or video conferencing) can be arranged at the request of the School Based Educator. The University Based Educator acts as the first point of contact throughout a student’s school experience responding to requests for information, or advice, normally within 24 hours (University Based Educator’s working days) Where an incident occurs outside of normal working hours, where there is an urgent need to contact the University, please telephone: (0131)-474-0000.

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Student Contact and Support</strong></p>
<p>Support from the programme teams is provided in different ways throughout school experience, reflecting current demands for sustainable practices including face to face meetings as well as the use of digital technologies.</p>
<p>University Based Educators act as the first point of contact for an identified group of students and School Based Educators throughout each school experience placement responding to initial requests for advice and support from School Based Educators and their students, normally within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Support is offered face-face, via email or MS Teams. If a student’s performance is causing concern on any school experience at the request of the School Based Educator and/or student, a visit can be arranged. A student will normally receive one visit per placement from the University Based Educator and a further visit if a cause for concern is raised. All communications and follow-up actions agreed with School Based Educators and students are documented and copies of completed reports and action plans are retained in their file and the relevant Year Tutor and Programme Leader are kept informed of any issues.</p>]]></Value>
