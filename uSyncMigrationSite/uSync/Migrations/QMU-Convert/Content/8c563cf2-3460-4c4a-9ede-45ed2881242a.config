You will thrive in our supportive environment, and benefit from placements each year along with practical experience in our specialist clinical facilities on campus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in face-to-face or online lectures, seminars, practical workshops and laboratories. Outside timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of assessment methods (eg written and practical exams, case studies, written assignments and presentations) at the end of each module or semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>There are practice placements in Years Two, Three and Four, amounting to a minimum of 1000 hours of practice-based learning. </p>\n<p>QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student on this course in partnership with Health Boards in Scotland and other universities in Scotland that deliver dietetic education. Placements are randomly allocated to students as part of a Scottish wide allocation process.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employablity placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that means they must remain in a specific location. </p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by both our Master of Dietetics (MDiet)/BSc (Hons) Dietetics and <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/9e8468f652364910ae77c80977dccdf8}\" title=\"MSc Dietetics (Pre-Registration)\">MSc Dietetics (Pre-Registration)</a> courses. Students have access to chemistry and microbiology laboratories for practical science based classes along with a fully equipped teaching kitchen and sensors suite for food based classed.  Practical rooms and a simulated ward environment are utilised for teaching and development of clinical skills. In addition students have access to appropriate equipment for completing nutritional assessments which is incorporated into teaching across all years of the course. QMU also has an allotment/community garden and students can also access and become involved in the community garden activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

Practice placements are an integral part of the course and allow students to put their theoretical knowledge into practice. </span></p>
<p>QMU offers two undergraduate pathways of study in Dietetics to achieve a recognised qualification. Initially all students register on the undergraduate master’s pathway and study together, then, from the end of the second year, students on the BSc (Hons) pathway follow a slightly different programme of study to those studying for the undergraduate master’s degree. On graduation, both pathways offer eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a dietitian.</p>
<p>Please see the course structure on this page for more information on the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/">benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>
