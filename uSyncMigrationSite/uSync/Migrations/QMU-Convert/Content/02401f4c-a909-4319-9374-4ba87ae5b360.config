<p>In a year that has been dominated by negative news, we are delighted to bring some much needed positivity. Our magazine not only focuses on the great work of our students, graduates and staff, it celebrates our history, acknowledges our present, and looks with confidence towards our future. We take this opportunity to share some significant milestones with you. This edition celebrates two anniversaries – 50 years of drama and 75 years of speech sciences. We have a proud history of education in these specialist areas, and are pleased that some of our graduates and staff have agreed to share their experiences and career stories with us.</p>
