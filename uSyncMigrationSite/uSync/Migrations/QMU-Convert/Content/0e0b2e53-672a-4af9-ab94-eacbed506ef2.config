      <Value><![CDATA[<p>As in all of our university-based modules, Hub@QMU plays a crucial role in the support of student learning and in the storage of relevant information.<span>  There will be one generic hub site, called <strong>Podiatric Clinical Practice</strong>, which will have information common to both the MPod, BSc (Hons) Podiatry and MSc Pre-Registration students, as well as programme and level specific areas. </span></p>
<p><span> </span>Information on clinical rotas, placement timetables and location of specific external clinical placements is not included in this handbook, but can be accessed via the Hub alongside copies of the relevant placement assessment forms and details of any additional assessment or university based activities.<span>  As placements information can change at short notice, please get into a routine of checking your QMU emails and the Hub for updates.</span></p>
<p>Whilst perhaps not reading it all at once, students are required to read the content of this document and should be able to access it throughout their practice-based learning placements.</p>
<p>We wish all students well in their studies, and hope you find practice-based learning both stimulating and challenging.</p>
<p>Carla McArdle – MPOD Programme Lead</p>
<p>Evelyn Weir – BSc (Hons) Programme Lead</p>
<p>Joseph McIntyre – Clinical Lead</p>
<p><strong><u>*Please note that the information contained within this handbook is representative of what ‘typically’ occurs with respect to practice placements on the outlined podiatry programmes here at QMU. However, changes may occur depending on the academic year, external pressures/changes (i.e. changes in organisations we link with to provide placements i.e. NHS boards etc). </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong><strong><u>Thus, whilst this booklet will give an ‘overview’ of what practice placements will/should look like; your clinical module lead, and overall clinical lead, will inform you of any changes specific to your module/academic year. </u></strong></p>]]></Value>

The address of Inchkeith House is; 139 Leith Walk, Edinburgh EH6 8NP.  The podiatry clinics are on the top two floors.  You will be given a code to enter into the keypad to open the door.  Details of all external placement allocations and geographical locations will be provided on the Hub.</span></p>\n<p>Your first exposure to the clinical area starts in the semester 1 of your first year when you will be in Inchkeith House.  This allows students to view the professional and clinical world, giving some exposure to key professional issues. Whilst your role in the placement will not involve patient care or patient contact, students are expected to undertake basic tasks as detailed in their programme specific foundation modules and to conduct themselves in a professional manner. You will then reflect and use your experiences to undertake your respective assessments using the experiences from within the clinical setting. </p>\n<p>You will then complete various placements over the four years (MPod, BSc (Hons) Podiatry or 2 years MSc Pre-Registration), of your degree course.</p>\n<p><strong>TABLE 1 Placements which students will undertake</strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Duration </th>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">UG Mood and BSc (hons)</th>\n<th width=\"243\" style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>Approximate notional placement hours</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Year 1</th>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Observation placements in QMU/IKH podiatry clinics – simulation and familiarisation</td>\n<td width=\"243\" style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>104 hours</p>\n<p>24 hours (orthotics lab)</p>\n<p>24 hours (reflective activity)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Year 2</th>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">External placements, placements in QMU podiatry clinics and Rogerson's placements. 4 week block in NHS GG&amp;C in summer (likely June)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>164 hours</p>\n<p>28 hours (orthotics lab)</p>\n<p>26 hours (local anaesthetic practical and theory)</p>\n<p>48 hours (reflective activity)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Year 3</th>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Observational placements, external placements, placements in QMU podiatry clinics, <strong><u>BLOCK PLACEMENTS (see appendix 1)</u></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>243 hours</p>\n<p>24 hours (orthotics lab)</p>\n<p>48 hours (reflective activity)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Year 4</th>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p> </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>MSc Podiatry (Pre reg)</p>\n</th>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Year 1</th>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>Observation placements in QMU podiatry clinics – simulation and familiarisation</p>\nExternal placements, placements in QMU podiatry clinics</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>268 hours</p>\n<p>30 hours (orthotics lab)</p>\n<p>26 hours (local anaesthetic practical and theory)</p>\n72 hours (reflective activity)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Year 2</th>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<p>External placements, placements in QMU podiatry clinics.

The HCPC Standards (2016) states ‘You must make sure that you have consent from service users or other appropriate authority before you provide care, treatment or other services’.</p>\n<p>The HCPC Guidance on Conduct and Ethics for Students (2010) expands by indicating that this is a 2 stage process-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>You should make sure that before you carry out any intervention that the service user is aware that you are a student.</em></li>\n<li><em>You should make sure that the service user has given their permission for the intervention to be carried out by a student</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>A change to the COP standards of clinical practice outlined;</em></strong></p>\n<p>That podiatrist needs to obtain verbal consent <strong><em>at every treatment episode</em></strong> and crucially also needs to record this in the notes. This can be a simple as the podiatrist saying to the patient “I am just going to cut your toe nails - is that OK?” The patient would then reply “Yes, that’s fine”. Then on the notes ‘Verbal consent gained for treatment’ should be written in the patient record card. The reason for this is that implied consent (for example a patient sitting in the treatment chair, or removing their socks) no longer exists or is recognised in law.</p>\n<p><strong>Record Keeping</strong></p>\n<p>Standard 10 from the HCPC Standards of Conduct, Performance and Ethics (2016) states:</p>\n<p>You must keep full, clear, and accurate records for everyone you care for, treat, or provide other services to.</p>\n<p>You must complete all records promptly and as soon as possible after providing care, treatment or other services.</p>\n<p>Record keeping policies/processes will be covered in your clinical modules and when you are out on placement.</p>"
