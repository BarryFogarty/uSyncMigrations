We focus on intensive stage and screen actor training with additional options that allow you to expand your skills to include areas such as community theatre, playwriting, directing, devising and creative entrepreneurship. The rich and varied curriculum means that the course will provide a distinctive and complementary course of actor training in the conservatoire tradition and provide you with the knowledge and skills required for the diverse range of ways in which you might wish to develop your career as an actor.</p>\n<p><br />Our teaching staff use practical and practice-led methods to explore the ways in which the skills you have already developed through further education can be modified and made appropriate to the constraints of different contexts, media and performance spaces. Core modules will support you to deepen your knowledge of the fundamental skills of acting, voice, movement, textual analysis and interpretation, examining the ways in which they are deployed and synthesised to create character and performance, on stage and screen and media work.</p>\n<p>This course enables you to convert an appropriate existing qualification into a degree and is equivalent to years three and four of an honours degree.</p>"
