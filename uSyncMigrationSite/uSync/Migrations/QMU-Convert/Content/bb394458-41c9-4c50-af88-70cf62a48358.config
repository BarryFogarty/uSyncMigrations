      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead-big\"><strong>Matriculation</strong></span></p>\n<p>As a new QMU student, you are required to formally register with QMU and sign a declaration that you agree to abide by the University’s regulations, including the payment of fees and other tuition costs. This registration process is referred to as ‘matriculation’.</p>\n<p>You should matriculate online on our website before you arrive. Registry will send you an email prompting you to complete the process. Please do not attempt to complete the matriculation process before you have received this email from Registry.</p>\n<p>You will need your student number to log in, which can be found on your offer letter. Once you have matriculated, you will be able to access student services such as your QMU email and the university's internet.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about matriculation, please contact the <a href=\"mailto:registry@qmu.ac.uk\">Student Records Team</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\"><strong>Accommodation</strong></span></p>\n<p>It is important to think about your accommodation early. </p>\n<p>QMU offers on-campus accommodation in our student village. There are 800 single bedrooms in self-contained flats for three to six students. Each flat has a shared kitchen/living area. We are unable to provide accommodation for couples or families.</p>\n<p>You can apply for on-campus accommodation with an unconditional or a conditional offer. You should apply online through <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/49e57caad87a497aace91c566c76f242}\" title=\"Living on Campus\">our accommodation system</a>. Once your application has been processed you will be sent an offer of accommodation which you should accept as soon as possible. You will need to make a £250 prepayment to confirm your place.</p>\n<p>Please note, that once you sign a lease for student accommodation for either 38 or 50 weeks, this is legally binding. One-semester study abroad/exchange students who sign an accommodation lease are liable for the duration of the semester.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What is provided?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Each en-suite single bedroom is equipped with a bed, wardrobe, desk, chest of drawers, shelves and chair. En-suite facilities consisting of a toilet, shower and washbasin. Each bedroom has a WIFI internet connection. The kitchen contains a fridge, freezer, electric cooker, microwave, electric kettle, and an electric toaster. Irons and ironing boards are provided and shared amongst groups of students as are brooms, mops and vacuum cleaners. Each living area (open plan to the kitchen) is equipped with a dining table and chairs.</p>\n<p>Personal contents insurance is also provided as part of the lease.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What you will need to provide?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Single or double sheets, pillow/s, pillowcases, towels, a duvet and duvet cover, cutlery, crockery, pots and pans. You can potentially purchase these in advance and have them delivered to QMU before you arrive. Details can be found in the Accommodation Guide that is sent out when you pay your deposit.</p>\n<p>You may prefer to purchase some of these items locally on arrival – we usually arrange a trip to IKEA during Induction Week.</p>\n<p>Emergency bedding packs are available on loan for one or two nights. These are limited in number and can be obtained on arrival at the University.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>The student village</strong></span></p>\n<p>You can see a video of the QMU Accommodation and access the online application form on our <a href=\"/campus-life/accommodation/\">accommodation web pages</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>When to arrive</strong> </span></p>\n<p>The Accommodation Team will advise you about your arrival period once your place in the accommodation is confirmed. You should then liaise with Accommodation Services about your arrival so that they know when to expect you.</p>\n<p>Contact the <a href=\"mailto:accommodation@qmu.ac.uk.\" title=\"Accommodation Team Email Address\">Accommodation Team</a> directly with any questions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Off-campus accommodation </strong></span></p>\n<p>You can find advice about searching for accommodation off campus in our <a href=\"/campus-life/accommodation/private-sector-accommodation-guide/\">private sector accommodation guide</a>.</p>\n<p>In order for students to meet the in-person class attendance level, and comply with our attendance monitoring (student sign in) as part of your Student visa responsibilities, we expect that students find accommodation within a reasonable commuting distance of <strong>no further</strong> than 50 miles from campus.</p>\n<p>You can also search for accommodation using the following links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.studentpad.co.uk/\">Student Pad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.unitestudents.com/\">UNITE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espc.co.uk/\">ESPC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.citylets.co.uk/\">City Lets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lettingweb.com/\">Letting Web</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Personal insurance</strong></span></p>\n<p>Basic contents insurance is included if you are staying on campus, however, it is a good idea to take out insurance for your personal belongings, especially if staying off campus. Several companies offer inexpensive cover. Search online for ‘student personal insurance’.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Visa and immigration</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Immigration</span></p>\n<p>You will need to check if you require a visa to study in the UK: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa\" title=\"gov.uk\">Check UK visa at gov.uk</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Credibility interviews</strong></span></p>\n<p>As part of the application process, you may be required to attend an interview to confirm your reasons for choosing the UK, QMU and your course, how you intend to fund your studies in the UK, and how this all fits into your career aspirations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Student Visa System</span></p>\n<p>For full details on the complete immigration policy, you should visit the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/student-visas\">UK Visa and Immigration website</a>. </p>\n<p>To obtain a student visa for a course at QMU you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have an Unconditional Firm Offer from our Admissions Team</li>\n<li>pay a £5000 deposit towards your tuition fees (or provide evidence of sponsorship)</li>\n<li>pay your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application\"><span>NHS Healthcare Surcharge</span></a></li>\n<li>request a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) from the Admissions Team</li>\n<li>complete and return the CAS request form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>QMU will then issue you with a CAS which can use to complete your Visa Application.</p>\n<p>Information and guidance on obtaining your student visa, paying your deposit etc. is available on the <a href=\"/study-here/international-students/visas-and-immigration/\">visa and immigration</a> page of our website.  </p>\n<p>We also run regular <a href=\"/study-here/international-students/opportunities-to-meet-us/\">online drop-in sessions</a> which we encourage you to join.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Visa Extensions</strong></span></p>\n<p>It is normally only possible to extend your visa if you have failed an element of your course or experienced an illness which has delayed your studies. If you need to extend your visa, you will need to complete an online application under the student category and obtain a new Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) from the International Team stating that you are a registered student.</p>\n<p>You can apply online or attend an interview in person in Glasgow. You should aim to organise your visa extension within three months of your visa expiring.</p>\n<p><strong>It is advisable to make a note in your diary of the date your visa expires.</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Local assistance</strong></span></p>\n<p>All countries have a British Embassy/British High Commission and most also have a local <a href=\"https://www.britishcouncil.org/\">British Council</a> Office where you can obtain help or advice. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\"><strong>Following a successful visa application</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs)</strong></span></p>\n<p>When your visa is granted, your passport will be returned to you with a ‘vignette’ attached; the vignette will last for 30-90 days. Within 10 days of arrival in the UK, you need to visit your designated Post Office to collect your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits\">Biometric Residence Permit</a> (BRP). If you cannot attend your designated Post Office within 30 days, you will not be penalised for this, but you should collect your BRP as soon as you can. </p>\n<p>We will take a copy of your BRP during induction.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What to bring to Scotland</strong></span></p>\n<p>Think about what type of clothing you will need to help you cope with the changeable weather in Scotland. Several thin layers of clothes are often more effective against the cold than one thick sweater or jacket. We recommend that you pack some long-sleeved jerseys or pullovers and a warm winter jacket. Sturdy footwear and thick socks will keep your feet warm in late autumn and winter. A hat, scarf and gloves are also recommended. Don’t worry if these are not readily available in your home country, as there are many shops in Edinburgh where you can buy outdoor clothing and accessories at reasonable prices. Edinburgh also has numerous ‘charity’ shops where students can purchase good quality second-hand clothes at bargain prices!</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What not to bring</strong></span></p>\n<p>International students often like to bring food and plant products from home with them when they come to study in the UK. You may not realise that there are strict rules governing the import of these products. Please don’t pack any fresh, dried or cured pork or wild boar meat to bring with you. This includes any pork or wild boar products such as sausages, bacon, meatballs, pate, ham, salami, jerky, bakwa and rougan, and products made of pork fat or wild boar fat, such as lardo and salo. It is illegal to bring these items into the UK from most countries outside of the EU. If your family or friends are sending you gifts by post, please ask them not to send any meat products.</p>\n<p>For wider information about the products you can and cannot bring with you visit <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/personal-food-plant-and-animal-product-imports\">the DEFRA website</a>.</p>\n<p>Visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UKCISA\">UKCISA website</a> as it is an excellent source of advice for international students, and includes many useful information pages.</p>"

Taxis (black cabs) run on a meter (fare between £45 and £55, journey time 30-45 minutes).</p>\n<p>Follow the signs for ‘Taxis’ at Edinburgh Airport arrivals. Alternatively, you can book a black cab in advance. The two main black cab companies in Edinburgh are <a href=\"http://www.taxis-edinburgh.co.uk/services/airport/\">Central Taxis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.citycabs.co.uk\">City Cabs</a>.</p>\n<p>Both companies offer larger vehicles if you have a lot of luggage. The taxi companies are reliable, and you will be safe and secure on your journey.</p>\n<p>Taking an Uber is also another option - Uber journeys are safe and reliable in the UK.</p>\n<p>Most taxis and public transport options will accept contactless payment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Airport bus</strong></span></p>\n<p>A regular <a href=\"https://www.lothianbuses.com/our-services/airport-buses/\">airport bus service to the city centre</a> is available from outside the main airport terminal building (fare £5.50, journey time 20-30 minutes to Waverley Bridge - opposite Waverley railway station). From Waverley Bridge, you can either take a taxi to QMU (fare between £20 and £30, journey time 20-30 minutes) or take a train from Edinburgh Waverley railway station to Musselburgh railway station, which is next to the QMU campus (fare, £3.10, journey time 6 minutes).</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Tram</span></p>\n<p>A regular tram service to the city centre is available from outside the main airport terminal building (fare £7.50, journey time 30 minutes to St Andrew’s Square, near Waverley railway station).

Whilst there are several bus services to the University from the city centre, these would not be suitable when travelling with a lot of luggage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Arriving at Glasgow Airport</strong></span></p>\n<p>From Glasgow Airport arrivals, please follow the signs for Buses/Coaches and proceed to Stance 1.

      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Culture Shock</span></p>\n<p>Leaving home to study in a foreign country can be a very exciting experience but we recognise it can also be quite challenging. Often students are surprised by the effect that travelling to another country can have on them. However, it is important to realise that many of your reactions are perfectly normal, regardless of where you are from or what you are studying. Culture Shock can be caused by several things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The shock of a new environment</li>\n<li>Different study methods</li>\n<li>Constantly meeting new people</li>\n<li>Being separated from your loved ones and the people who you would usually turn to for advice</li>\n<li>The climate<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n<li>The food</li>\n<li>Being immersed in a foreign language</li>\n<li>Social customs that challenge what you have always accepted as ‘normal’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to recognise the symptoms of culture shock and look after yourself. It is perfectly normal, and to be expected, that you may feel homesick, and you may be surprised when it hits you. You may have difficulty sleeping, or want to sleep all the time; you may get headaches or be overanxious. Often your concentration span is affected, and your emotions may fluctuate more than normal.</p>\n<p>Remember that there are support networks in place to help you through any difficult times. Here is some basic advice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain a healthy, balanced diet</li>\n<li>Take regular light exercise</li>\n<li>Keep in touch with your friends and family at home by email or make a few extra phone calls or video chats </li>\n<li>Make friends with other international students, as often they will understand what you are going through</li>\n<li>Join some societies, or get involved with your local community as this is a way of keeping yourself busy and also getting to know other Scottish students who can in turn help you to understand the culture better</li>\n<li>Speak to someone from the International Office, the Wellbeing Adviser or a Student Counsellor</li>\n<li>Ultimately, look after yourself and remember that culture shock is a perfectly natural reaction to life in a new environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Finance</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Currency</span></p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>: £100, £50, £20, £10, £5, and £1</p>\n<p><strong>Coins</strong>: £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, and 1p</p>\n<p>In Scotland, three different banks can issue bank notes: the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank. In England, only the Bank of England issues banknotes. If you are visiting England and using cash, it is recommended that you take English bank notes.</p>\n<p>ATMs will accept Visa, MasterCard and most other cards. There are a number of banks nearby in Musselburgh where you can open an account, including:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.santander.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Santander\">Santander</a><br /><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.bankofscotland.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bank of Scotland\">Bank of Scotland</a><br /><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.tsb.co.uk/personal/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"TSB\">TSB</a><br /><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://personal.rbs.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Royal Bank of Scotland\">RBS</a></p>\n<p>There are more banks in the centre of Edinburgh. Banks are usually open from 9.00am until 5pm, Monday to Friday, except for bank holidays, and some branches will also open on Saturdays, although often on reduced hours.</p>\n<p>Since the COVID pandemic, contactless payment has become widespread and will be accepted by most shops and businesses.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Opening a Bank Account</span></p>\n<p>You must open a bank account as soon as you arrive in the UK.</p>\n<p>Your chosen bank will ask you to provide photo identification, confirmation that you are a student at QMU and your postal address. Therefore, once you have chosen a bank, go to the School Office in the University and they will prepare a letter confirming your student status and your postal address. <strong>Please make sure you give at least 48 hours notice!</strong> We can only issue one bank letter per student.</p>\n<p>If you bring a banker’s draft in your name, in Pounds Sterling (£GBP) with you, please ensure that the draft is drawn on a UK bank as this speeds up transactions and ensures that commission payments are dealt with locally in your own country. Once you deposit the draft it should take between seven to ten days to clear. Do not bring personal cheques as many banks will not accept them.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Employment</span></p>\n<p>Most international students studying for longer than six months do not require a work permit to work part-time. International students studying full-time are allowed to work in the UK for up to 20 hours per week as long as the work meets certain conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must not work for more than 20 hours a week during term time, except where a work placement is to be undertaken as a necessary part of the course of study as agreed by the education institution.</li>\n<li>Your BRP must not say 'prohibition on taking employment'.</li>\n<li>You cannot engage in business, self-employment, the provision of services, or take work as a professional entertainer or sportsperson.</li>\n<li>You should not pursue a career by filling a permanent full-time vacancy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further details about the regulations on employment can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/Information--Advice/Working/Tier-4-work\">UKCISA website</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are on a short-term study abroad or exchange programme from a country which does not require a UK entry visa, you will need to obtain a student visa if you want to work part-time while studying. If you are a study abroad or exchange student, please contact <a href=\"mailto:StudyAbroad@qmu.ac.uk\">StudyAbroad@qmu.ac.uk</a> for further guidance.</p>\n<p>If you decide to work, you will need to obtain a National Insurance number. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number\">More information about obtaining a National Insurance number</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Healthcare</span></p>\n<p>All Student Route students who have paid the Immigration Health Surcharge as part of the visa application process are entitled to free medical advice and hospital treatment under the National Health Service in Scotland. The cost of dental care and eye tests are not covered by the NHS.</p>\n<p>It is advisable to register with a doctor once you are settled in your accommodation.
