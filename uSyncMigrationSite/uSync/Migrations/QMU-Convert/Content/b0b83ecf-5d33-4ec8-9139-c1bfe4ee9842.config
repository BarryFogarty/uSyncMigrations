      "content": "<p>4.1    Bachelors degree programmes are designed to provide a general higher education as well as a grounding in a specific area or areas, and thus have both general and specific aims. Each particular programme has unique characteristics, the realisation of which should satisfy both the general and the specific aims. The general educational aims of a degree programme are described as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a primary aim must be the development of the student's intellectual and imaginative development, which should be promoted by the curriculum content and organisation, by the way in which it is taught, and by the programme regulations</li>\n<li>the direction of the student's studies must be towards greater understanding and competence. Thus, while it may be appropriate to include the acquisition of techniques or skills, or the learning of data, these must lead to a higher level of intellectual and creative performance than that intrinsic in the learning of the skills, techniques or facts themselves</li>\n<li>a programme must stimulate an enquiring, analytical and creative approach, it must encourage independent judgement and critical self-awareness. It must be planned and taught to provide balance in content and presentation allowing the student freedom to draw his or her own conclusions while encouraging a rigorous approach to data, demonstration and argument which will ensure that these conclusions are soundly based</li>\n<li>the programme must encourage the skills of clear communication and logical argument, and the full and effective use of language must be fostered, in both spoken and written forms</li>\n<li>the student must also be encouraged to develop the ability to see relationships within what he or she has learned, and to relate what he or she has learned to actual situations</li>\n<li>students should be encouraged to appreciate the nature of attitudes, modes of thought, practices and disciplines other than those of the main studies. They should learn to perceive the main studies in a broader perspective. As part of this process they should be enabled to develop an informed awareness of factors influencing the social and physical environment</li>\n<li>an undergraduate degree programme should encourage the student in the development of independence and self direction so that these characteristics can be exercised, albeit under guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.2     In addition, a degree programme must fulfil certain social aims. It must aim to fulfil the needs of the community for qualified individuals and it must also meet the aspirations of prospective students.</p>\n<p>4.3     Awards at SCQF levels 9 and 10 must be designed in line with the University’s <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/\"><strong>generic graduate attributes</strong>.</a></p>\n<p>4.4     In terms of traditional Scottish qualifications and study patterns, the standard of the Unclassified Degree may be described as that expected of a student with prior knowledge and skills equivalent to five Scottish Certificates of Education passes, of which three are at Higher grade, who has successfully completed a programme of study suitable for the fulfilment of the general education aims; the normal length of the programme will be three full-time academic years or equivalent.</p>\n<p>4.5    The standard of the Honours Degree in Scotland may be described as that expected of a student with prior knowledge and skills equivalent to an Unclassified Scottish Degree who has successfully completed an additional programme of study at Honours degree level, suitable for the fulfilment of the general educational aims; and who has demonstrated the capacity for sustained independent and high quality work; the normal length of the programme will be one further full-time academic year or equivalent.</p>\n<p> </p>"
