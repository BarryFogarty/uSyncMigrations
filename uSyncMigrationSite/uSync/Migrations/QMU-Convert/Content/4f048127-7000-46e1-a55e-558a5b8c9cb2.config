A dietitian influences food selection and eating behaviour of an individual based on specific nutritional or food requirements.</p>\n<p>As a dietitian, you will translate scientific information about nutrition into practical advice to help people make health-conscious decisions about food. You will assess, diagnose and treat diet-related problems and aim to raise awareness of the link between food, health and disease to prevent future problems and treat existing nutrition-related problems. Dietitians are a key part of the healthcare team and are the only nutrition professionals to be statutorily regulated.</p>\n<p>The course takes you through a clinically and practically focused study of disease, health, food and nutrition. With a clinical and health promotion focus, the course includes three practice-based placements that allow students to apply and consolidate their theoretical learning.</p>"

This would then permit entry into the MSc Dietetics (pre-registration) course the following year.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that it can be difficult to get shadowing experience, so relevant experience that demonstrates transferable skills to those required by dietitians would be beneficial.</p>\n<p>International: You will be required to provide evidence of English language competence at no less than IELTS 7.0 and no individual component score below 6.5.</p>\n<p>Criminal Records Check: A satisfactory criminal records check will be required.</p>"

It fulfilled all of my hopes of what the course would teach me, from developing nutritional interventions to diet analysis. It also gave me the practical experience and skills to go confidently into the dietetic world through 26 weeks of external placement within the NHS. It was challenging at times, but I personally never feel like you are learning if something is too easy.\"",
