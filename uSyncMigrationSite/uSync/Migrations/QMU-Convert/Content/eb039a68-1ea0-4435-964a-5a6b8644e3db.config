<p><strong>LAUREN THOMSON, WHO was one of the first students to graduate with BA (Hons) </strong><strong>Education Studies (Primary), won a bursary from the General Teaching Council for </strong><strong>Scotland for her dissertation which looked at how teachers can challenge homophobic </strong><strong>attitudes in the classroom. The awards team described her dissertation as a ‘powerful </strong><strong>contribution to what it means to become a teacher in Scotland’.</strong><span class="lead-big"></span></p>
<p>As someone who identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community, Lauren’s motivation for her research was a mix of professional and personal interest. She said: “QMU’s Initial Teacher Education degree has great inclusion and social justice links, so I was encouraged to pick something I could have a relationship with, and that I cared about.”</p>
<p>Lauren was thrilled to win the George D Gray CBE MA Award and is passionate about helping primary schools do more to discuss and represent diversity.</p>
<p>Lauren, who is carrying out her probationary teaching year at a primary school in Haddington, won high praise from the General Teaching Council, her local council and her school. East Lothian Council’s Head of Education, Nicola McDowell, said: “Lauren’s work will help to influence and shape professional understanding around how we can challenge homophobia and create inclusive and supportive environments for our children and young people.”</p>
<p><span class="lead-big"><strong>Joseph shines a light on learning challenges for people with autism</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>JOSEPH MCPHERSON, ONE of the first students to graduate from QMU with a BA (Hons) Education Studies, had a unique education journey. During his second year at QMU, he discovered he had autism, which helped him understand some of the challenges he experienced at school, college and university.</strong></p>
<p>But with a strong drive to succeed and to help others with similar learning challenges, twenty-six-year-old Joseph threw himself into his university work. During his final year, Joseph focused his dissertation on his experience of navigating higher education as someone on the autistic spectrum. He said: “I felt strongly<br />about doing a piece of work which looked at how learning environments can be inherently disabling for people with diverse sensory needs. I wanted to illuminate the impact that local and broader higher education policy has on people’s educational experiences and outcomes, particularly those with additional support needs.”</p>
<p>As someone with lived experience of autism, who has navigated further and higher education, Joseph hopes that his experience – encapsulated within his dissertation – will serve as a learning opportunity for QMU and practitioners to make changes to both practice and space to ensure they are inclusive.</p>
<p>With one of the highest dissertation marks awarded at QMU, Joseph was subsequently presented with the Atholl Crescent Award from the QMU Association. Since graduating with a first-class honour’s degree, he has worked in various support services roles with Edinburgh College and looks forward to further developing his career in student support and education policy development.</p>]]></Value>
