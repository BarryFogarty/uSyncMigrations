<p><br />Hybrid working can offer a number of benefits to staff and the University. It is recognised that not all roles are suited to hybrid working and not all staff wish to work in a hybrid way.</p>
<p><br />Our hybrid working arrangements are intended to provide additional flexibly for staff to find an appropriate balance of on campus and remote working. The University’s approach to hybrid working is set out in our Statement on Hybrid Working.</p>
<p><br />There is a wealth of guidance on hybrid working available from various sources. In this guidance for staff, which sits alongside our Statement on Hybrid Working, we have reflected some of the key tips, advice and ideas for enabling effective hybrid working from best practice.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">First things first…</span><br />Make sure that you have read and understood our Statement on Hybrid Working, your manager and HR Partner can assist you with any points of clarification needed.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Discuss hybrid working with your manager and team…</span><br />As a starting point, your manager may arrange a meeting to discuss hybrid working within your team. In some instances, managers will want to discuss hybrid working preferences on an individual basis instead of, or in addition to, holding a team meeting. In some areas, particularly academic divisions, colleagues have been working in a hybrid way for some time prior to the pandemic, so may not consider a meeting to be necessary, however teams are encouraged to have an open dialogue around hybrid working arrangements wherever possible.</p>
<p><br />Before speaking with your manager and team you are encouraged to consider your own hybrid working preferences, taking into account the requirements of your role and the parameters set out in our Statement on Hybrid Working. You should be prepared to accept that it may not always be possible to accommodate your preferences fully due to the needs of the University and/or your team.</p>
<p><br />Deans/Heads of Division/Heads of Department/Service are responsible for making decisions regarding how a service will be delivered, however it is important that you contribute to these decisions by discussing your views with your manager and team.</p>
<p><br />It is understood that you may have a preference for hybrid working due to personal circumstances, which you may not want to discuss in a team environment, if this is the case, ask for a confidential discussion with your manager prior to the team discussion.</p>
<p><br />Remember, hybrid working is informal and variable and you should not make permanent personal arrangements based on the expectation of continuous fixed hybrid working. If you need a guaranteed commitment that you can work certain hours or days which differ from your existing contract of employment you should make an application via the University’s Flexible Working Policy.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Communication is so important.</span><br />We all know the value of team members communicating well with each other. In a hybrid working environment communication needs to be more intentional and planned, as there might be fewer casual or ad hoc conversations. However, the key principles of good communication remain: all staff need to have the information that they need, in a timely way, to allow them to successfully undertake their work.</p>
<p><br />One of the most important factors in communicating within a hybrid team is ensuring that information reaches everyone it needs to, wherever and whenever they are working. Equal access to information and knowledge is key to preventing communication issues and feelings of unfairness.</p>
<p><br />Responsibility for ensuring effective communication is maintained is the shared responsibility of you, your fellow team members and your manager.</p>
<p><br />A couple of top tips for communicating within a hybrid team are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk within your team about how you will communicate with each other. Your team might wish to consider developing a communications protocol so it is clear to everyone how communication will be handled.</li>
<li>Ensure that you have regular one-to-one time with your manager and others you work closely with.</li>
<li>Different messages require different formats of delivery - consider the correct channel for the message you want to convey, bearing in mind that in person may be the best way for some difficult and sensitive matters.</li>
<li>Be aware of achieving the right tone, aim to write emails and instant messages in a clear and empathetic tone.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Our top tips for effective hybrid working…<br /></span><br /><strong>1. Plan ahead</strong><br />If you need to collaborate with colleagues in person, make sure to connect with them early on so you can sync your scheduled days in the office. This also will allow you to update your calendar and availability so colleagues can see where and when you’ll be working on campus or remotely.<br /><br /><strong>2. Stay in touch</strong><br />Make sure you communicate with team members, colleagues and your manager often and ensure that they know you are available if they need to be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>3. Set boundaries</strong><br />With flexibility, sometimes it’s hard to create boundaries. Don’t forget to make yours! Make sure you take regular breaks and create a routine that works for you.</p>
<p><strong> 4. Make sure you have everything you need</strong><br />Having the right equipment and technology is important, you can find advice and guidance on workstation set up and on our <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/5c334dbad1fc4fd298200b477c4b3a79}" title="At Home">QMU@Home webpage</a>.</p>
