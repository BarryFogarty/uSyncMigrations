      <Value><![CDATA[<p>QMU's IT department is currently seeking candidates for three key roles to play a part in the continuing success of the team and the University.</p>
<p>The roles we are looking to fill are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40%;"><strong>Software Developer<br /></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40%;"><strong>Web Developer</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40%;"><strong>DBA</strong></p>
<p>We are a relatively small team with big impact and get involved across all areas of the University. Our customers are demanding and push us to be ever more creative in the way we provide our services. Students, staff, external partners, all look to us to be innovative and delivery oriented.</p>
<p>As a member of a highly creative group, you will be given the opportunity to work with the latest toolset and see projects through from inception to delivery. Often working off a completely blank sheet to provide solutions to business problems.</p>
<p>The management style is very much one of empowerment, allowing colleagues to recommend and advise new ways of delivering, while focussing on the end customer at all times. If it’s a good idea, we’ll want to hear about it.</p>
<p>If this sounds like your kind of role and you want to work in an environment where you can make a real difference, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p>There's lots of detail below but if you want to know more, feel free to contact us directly.</p>
<p style="float: left;">David MacLeman<br />Lead Developer<br /><a href="mailto:dmacleman@qmu.ac.uk">dmacleman@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>
<p style="float: left; margin-left: 30%;">Scott Kerr<br />Head of IT<br /><a href="mailto:dmacleman@qmu.ac.uk">skerr1@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>
