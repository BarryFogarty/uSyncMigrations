      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This year the event returns to QMU, where the inaugural conference first took place. The Scottish Physiotherapy Student Conference 2017 is open to all physiotherapy students in Scotland, including those from QMU, Glasgow Caledonian University and Robert Gordon University, as well as practicing clinicians, educators and academics.</p>
<p>The special event is also open to physiotherapy students and clinicians from the rest of the UK as well as to interested health and social care professionals.</p>
<p>Organised for students by students, the event aims to bring together physiotherapy students, supporting educators and clinicians to enhance knowledge, encourage collaboration and inspire innovation. It also aims to provide an excellent networking opportunity and supportive environment for students and newly qualified physiotherapists.</p>
<p>This year's conference theme is ‘Rehabilitation and Technology’. Physiotherapy is grounded in a strong tradition of holistic, non-invasive treatment approaches, prolonged patient contact times and a broad scope of practice. While staying true to this, it is imperative that new technologies are embraced in an attempt to streamline services, while maintaining our efforts to promote patient centered care. This year’s conference intends to expose attendees to five of the technology trends shaping physiotherapy: mobile technology and apps, wearable and sensor technology, social media, bionics, and telerehab.</p>
<p>With speakers confirmed from three countries, attendees will be able to learn and enhance their own opportunities to impact the health and social welfare of the population utilising the latest technological innovations.</p>
<p>Notable speakers include QMU’s very own Amanda Stears, who will tackling the subject of telerehab. QMU’s Janet Thomas will be discussing Physiotalk, a tweetchat platform which she helped co-found. Other highlights of the day include Dr. Andy Kerr of Strathclyde University, who will be speaking about ’Technology and Stroke Rehabilitation’; and Stephanie Mansell, a physiotherapist with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, who will be speaking about her experience in telehealth and the use of apps with her sleep and ventilation population. </p>
<p>Dr Judith Lane, senior lecturer and programme leader for MSc pre-registration physiotherapy at QMU explained: "The Scottish Student Physiotherapy Conference is now well-established in the student calendar. This student-led initiative offers a unique opportunity for physiotherapy students from across Scotland and beyond to network and engage in critical discussion about issues affecting the future development of the profession.  We’re very excited to welcome back to QMU the 2017 conference with what promises to be a stimulating and innovative programme".</p>
<p>Delegates can benefit from the diverse workshops covering everything from interview preparation, 'How to Start a Business', sports and Kinesiology taping, mechanotherapy, and foam rolling.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, attendees are encouraged to visit the 1875 food court area, where they will have the opportunity to try various patient protocols on a Wii Fit, visit with vendors, and enter a raffle for their chance to win prizes - including a Physiopedia Plus account.</p>
<p>The event provides the opportunity to gain 7.5 hours worth of continuous professional development. Certificates will be provided.</p>
<p>Spaces at the event are limited to 250 delegates and registration closes on 14 October 2017.</p>
