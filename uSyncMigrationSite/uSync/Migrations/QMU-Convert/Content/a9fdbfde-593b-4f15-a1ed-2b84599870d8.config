      "content": "<p>‘That’s the Tricky Bit’: Supporting Young Children’s Participation in Cultural and Artistic Life [BUR 24-11]</p>\n<p>This PhD project will explore very young children’s right to participate fully in cultural and artistic life, as enshrined in Article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). Cultural and artistic expressions such as dance, theatre, literature, music, and film are essential to children’s wellbeing, learning, and development. However, there is a gap in access to this right, particularly for babies and young children under three years old, as they are rarely acknowledged as rights holders. Thinking optimistically, this implementation gap represents a rich opportunity for research and knowledge exchange.</p>\n<p>The successful candidate will work in partnership with Starcatchers<a href=\"https://starcatchers.org.uk/\"></a>, Scotland’s Arts and Early Years organisation, to construct a case study of how babies and young children under three years old are experiencing their right to participate in cultural and artistic life.  The project will take place in an urban community in Central Scotland, experiencing high levels of deprivation, where Starcatchers has established an evolving Centre of Excellence model of practice. The methodology will be designed in consultation with participants, but we envisage qualitative and creative methods playing a role, with children’s rights at the centre.</p>\n<p>The successful candidate will have a relevant undergraduate degree with a 1st or 2:1 honours classification (or international equivalent) and/or a Master’s degree in a relevant discipline. Equivalent experience will also be considered.  </p>\n<p>What type of knowledge and skills are we looking for in an applicant?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong knowledge of children’s rights in early childhood.</li>\n<li>Practical experience of working with children and young people, preferably in arts/creativity/early years.</li>\n<li>Ability to work collaboratively with diverse communities including young children, families, artists, and other key stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Some research skills in qualitative research.</li>\n<li>Skill in working both independently and collaboratively, and confidence to drive projects forward while maintaining sensitive relationships with communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Successful research proposals will detail a clear three-year programme of study. This will include a review of relevant literature, a proposed methodological journey, and a considered grounding in young children’s rights.</p>\n<p>Please contact Dr Caralyn Blaisdell (cblaisdell@qmu.ac.uk) if you wish to discuss your application and proposal.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Green Horizons: Nurturing Health and Wellbeing Through Nature-Based Solutions in Schools [BUR 24-12]</p>\n<p>Recent research suggests that the health and wellbeing of children in Scotland is deteriorating. At the same time, the climate and biodiversity crises are driving the need for extensive nature-based solutions. Spending time outdoors in natural environments benefits children’s well-being whilst fostering a sense of connection with nature that promotes pro-environmental attitudes and actions. School grounds present a unique and scalable opportunity to offer nature-based solutions, which can improve the health and wellbeing of children, while supporting biodiversity and climate-proofing cities (e.g. Barrable &amp; Booth, 2020; Robinson &amp; Barrable, 2023). Although changes in school grounds are currently happening at national policy level, there is a need to ensure that stakeholders, namely teachers and children, are able to connect with nature and make the most of the outdoor environments at school.</p>\n<p>The PhD candidate will work in partnership with local and national organisations (e.g. Learning through Landscapes or Thrive Outdoors/Inspiring Scotland) and stakeholders, to understand the barriers and facilitators of engaging with nature in schools and then co-design a variety of resources. The resources will be designed to shape teachers’, children’s and families’ attitudes towards biodiversity, and promote positive and playful interactions with the natural world in schools. Finally, they will be trialled to test their efficacy.</p>\n<p>The successful candidate will have a 1st/ 2.1 Honours Undergraduate degree, and/or a Master’s degree in a relevant discipline (e.g. Psychology, Childhood Studies, Education, Sport Science, Health) and/or equivalent experience. </p>\n<p>What type of knowledge and skills are we looking for in an applicant? </p>\n<ul>\n<li>An interest in (and experience of) the ways in which children engage and interact with the natural world.</li>\n<li>Ability to build relationships and communicate effectively with communities and liaise with key stakeholders (e.g., parents, teachers and schools).</li>\n<li>Some research skills in qualitative and/or quantitative research and a willingness to learn and apply skills from both approaches.</li>\n<li>Dynamism and enthusiasm to drive ideas forward, set goals and work to deadlines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your proposal should detail relevant interdisciplinary literature you might draw upon as well as outlining your proposed research design for the research aims outlined above. Please contact Dr Alex Barrable (abarrable@qmu.ac.uk) to discuss your application and proposal. </p>"

      "content": "<p>ESG Standards Between Greenwashing Concerns and SDG Aims. Defining a New Normal for Sustainable Finance [BUR 24-13]</p>\n<p>The ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) metrics have been playing an increasingly central role in the financial markets, with nearly 47% of investment assets (about GBP 10 trillion) in the UK integrating ESG factors into the investment process in 2021. After being hailed as a true step forward to help meet SDGs and foster a more inclusive and sustainable approach to corporate finance, however, the ESG metrics have recently come under attack both from institutional investors and consumers.</p>\n<p>The aim of this bursary is to support PhD proposals aiming to explore ESG standards design and application, with objectives including but not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Investigate and highlight the factors affecting the ESG metrics application across different sectors/companies.</li>\n<li>Design and model a set of corrective measures for a more even implementation of the existing ESG metrics. We also welcome the investigation and inclusions of Industry 4.0 solutions (e.g., blockchain, AI, IoT sensors).</li>\n<li>Design and trial an innovative, composite index that complements the existing ESG metrics, catering to the needs of the financial sector and other stakeholders such as multinational companies, insurers, and policymakers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The methodology will depend on the specific objectives of the proposal, but it will likely consist of a mixed-method approach, with a PRISMA-based systematic review, multivariate statistical analysis /ML for the ESG metrics, and a qualitative (pilot) study with corporate stakeholders. The proposal should also include an initial overview of the academic literature available in support of the study, as well as initial indications of envisaged outcomes of the project.</p>\n<p>For any enquiries, please contact Dr Stefania Paladini <a href=\"mailto:SPaladini@qmu.ac.uk\">SPaladini@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>"
