<p>An International exchange?</p>
<p>Can I do an exchange to the United States when I am 28 years old, married, have a mortgage to pay and have a job?</p>
<p>Let’s start by rewinding ten years…</p>
<p>When I first came to QMU in 2006 as a fresh faced eighteen-year-old to study Sociology and Cultural Studies I was ready to take on the world. The sociological world that is. Most reading this blog will not be able to comprehend that I came from Fife to study at QMU…in Corstorphine! Before the huge, shiny, hospital like Craighall Campus was erected I studied at the old campus which was a world away from pre lecture, student discounted Lattes from Starbucks.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the age of twenty and I was defeated. Struggling to cope with the financial challenges of being a student and the work / life balance, I decided to take a year out after my second year. After obtaining my Diploma in Higher Education I planned to return a year later. After a few quick promotions at work I was earning well and living a more comfortable life. I asked myself; why go back and eat super noodles and drink Value Lager when I can afford to eat out and buy beer that’s <strong><u>not</u></strong> on promotion? That would be crazy…wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Well no it wouldn’t be. After eight years working with the same company, a good five years picking up invaluable management experience, I decided enough is enough. If I ever want to get my degree and follow my dream to do a job helping people improve their lives, it needs to be now.</p>
<p>With a wedding coming up…that’s my wedding I’m talking about…a mortgage payment coming out the bank every month and a honeymoon to pay for would this be the best decision? After much deliberation and support from my now wife, I decided it was time.</p>
<p>After a few chats with a very helpful head of department I was back at QMU as an associate student. Studying one day a week, whilst working fulltime, I obtained a satisfactory grade to return as a direct entry to 3<sup>rd</sup> year Public Sociology. I couldn’t believe that I was going to get my degree. Super chuffed!</p>
<p>That brings us to September 2016.</p>
<p>Now a third year Public Sociology student, working as a disability employment advisor for a fantastic voluntary organisation based in Edinburgh, I am now on track to achieve my goal.</p>
<p>You’re now probably thinking, well that was a very nice story Greg however what about the exchange? Ah yes…this is all relevant to the decision to go on an international exchange in which I will share next…</p>
