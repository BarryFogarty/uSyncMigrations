<p>What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been your highlight?<br />I have enjoyed studying a wide range of modules throughout my four years at QMU. The highlight of my time at QMU is most definitely the people I have met along the way. I have met so many wonderful people, built a number of strong connections with Lecturers, relationships with coursemates and made friends for life. Studying at QMU has been an enormous learning curve, as both my academic abilities and confidence have flourished.</p>
<p>How have your lecturers supported your learning?<br />The Business lecturers are extremely approachable, supportive and dedicated. A wide range of theoretical aspects are taught whilst also incorporating as much practical work as possible to ensure you are well equipped for the competitive world of business. The small class sizes at QMU means lecturers can get to know you on a first name basis and support you throughout your Degree.</p>
<p>Any advice for students who might be interested in this course?<br />If you are interested in Business Management but not sure which particular area interests you most then QMU is the University for you. During your four years you will undertake a wide range of modules, ranging from Economics, Finance and Accounting, Business Law, New Enterprise Creation, Sustainable Development, Project Management, Leading Change, Strategy and finally undertaking your own Research Project. By undertaking a Degree that gives you a deep understanding of the core functions required by organization’s today. After two years you are given the opportunity to select a specific route of study to focus on, including Business Management with: Finance, Enterprise or Marketing. However, if you are like me and have absolutely no clue where you want to go then you can continue on the general Business Management route.</p>
<p>Enhancing student learning and personal development</p>
<p>Have you joined any schemes/initiatives to enhance your learning and development such as a mentoring scheme, volunteering scheme, etc.? <br />In my fourth year, I volunteered as a PALS (Peer Assisted Learning Scheme) Leader. This scheme enables senior students to plan and run group sessions on certain modules to help those studying in the years below. The organization, planning and delivery of PALS sessions during my fourth year at QMU contributed to me gaining the skills required to successfully secure a place on the Primary PGDE course at Aberdeen University.</p>
<p>Life as a Student at QMU</p>
<p>What’s your ‘top tip’ for making the most of being a student?<br />My top-tip for making the most out of being a student is to grab every opportunity thrown at you with both hands and make the most of it, no matter how nervous you are, I can assure you that you will not look back!</p>
<p>What has been the most valuable lesson that you’ve learned at university?<br />The most valuable lesson I have learned during my time at QMU is when you have the support of lecturers, friends and family around you, it is amazing what you can achieve. At the start of my University journey, I did not think that I would make it to fourth year and be writing a dissertation, but with the continued support of the academic staff, my family and friends, that I have met through University, I have reached the final semester of my final year!</p>
<p>What are your plans after graduation? Tell us about your ambitions and where you see yourself in the future? <br />In August 2020, I will begin studying a Post Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) in Primary education at Aberdeen University. Despite going on to study further, in a field that many view as being quite different, the range of skills I have learnt whilst studying Business Management at QMU will forever stay with me and h</p>]]></Value>

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p>About you<br />Why did you choose to study at QMU and what attracted you to the course?<br />I chose to study at QMU due to the friendly and welcoming atmosphere that I experienced when visiting. QMU felt like one big community of students and lecturers. Everyone was so helpful, and the size of the university meant that class sizes were a lot smaller than other universities. When visiting QMU I realised that everything I needed was on campus including Accommodation, the Student’s Union, the gym, the library and on-campus security, in addition to the bus stop and train station being a stone throw away. This made moving away from home, for the first time, a lot less daunting.</p>]]></Value>
