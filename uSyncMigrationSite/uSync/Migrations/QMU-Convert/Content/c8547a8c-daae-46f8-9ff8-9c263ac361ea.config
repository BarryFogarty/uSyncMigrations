      "content": "<p>Communication, media, and culture not only shape people’s lives but are also pivotal to the way in which politics and policymaking work. Companies and brands have recognised this for some time now in their lobbying, advocacy, and social responsibility work. In this age of activism, so have ordinary people when they mobilize to advocate for ways—laws and policies—to change how governments and companies go about their business. There is politics (and policy) in the food we eat, in the education we get, in how we travel,  how we build homes, in who makes our clothes and what happens to them when we no longer use them. And this is what this course is about.</p>\n<p>We recognise the growing importance of specialist skills that combine communication with strategic management, and an understanding of public affairs, that is issues of interest to the public. Many organizations, from huge corporations to grassroots  organizations, rely on public affairs specialists to be able to conduct their activities, to look after their reputation and, most importantly, to have a say in how the world is shaped by what governments and legislators do.</p>\n<p>As you will learn, not all people who do these jobs think of themselves as public affairs specialists, some may be called policy officers, or public engagement managers, but whatever the job title, there are core competencies that you need, and that you will start developing with our help. </p>\n<p>The course is suitable if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are interested in public affairs, media, and communication, irrespective of the subjects in which you already have an academic qualification</li>\n<li>already work in a communication or PR role and want to specialize in public affairs and/or</li>\n<li>aim to progress to a research career in communication or strategic communication, members of QMU’s teaching team are influential published authors and regularly present at conferences all over the world.</li>\n</ul>"
