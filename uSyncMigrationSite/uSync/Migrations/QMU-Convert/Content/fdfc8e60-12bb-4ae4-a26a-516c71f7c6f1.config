      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>Queen Margaret University (QMU) is offering a short course, ‘Introduction to Art Psychotherapy’, for people who have an interest in the subject and who may be considering a change of career direction. </span> </p>
<p><span>The course is part of QMU’s short course programme, which is designed</span><span> to give people the chance to develop their skills while remaining in the workplace or exploring new career paths without having to commit to a full-time </span><span>undergraduate or postgraduate degree.</span> </p>
<p><span>The ‘Introduction to Art Psychotherapy’ will give students the opportunity to take their first steps into the field of Art Therapy. The short course introduces them to some of the key theories that inform current practice and provides the opportunity to explore their first workshops and the key themes </span><span>relevant to the Art Psychotherapy profession. Students can interact with lecturers and other students in this in-person course which is delivered at QMU’s campus in Musselburgh. </span> </p>
<p><span>The course will run from February to May 2023 over the course of one weekend every month. Splitting the course over only one weekend a month makes it far easier to integrate with people’s personal and professional commitments.</span> </p>
<p><span>The course will be taught in a series of face-to-face workshops and has no formal entry requirements for candidates, which makes it the perfect first step for people interested in exploring the profession of Art Psychotherapy. Applications can be made through an online form, which can be found on the </span><a href="/study-here/short-courses/short-courses/introduction-to-art-psychotherapy-short-course/"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">course page</span></a><span>.</span> </p>
<p><span>Introduction to Art Psychotherapy will be assessed at the end of the four-months with a 2000-word assignment designed to consolidate everything students have learned over their studies. While the course is non-qualifying, and students will not be eligible to practice as an Art Therapist, it is nevertheless the perfect introduction to the field and can help to open the door to studying on the MSc Art Psychotherapy programme</span> <span>at QMU.</span> </p>
<p><span>The course will be taught by QMU and visiting lecturers and will incorporate both workshops but also provide students with valuable reading materials which can help deepen their understanding of this valuable profession.</span> </p>
<p><span>Dr Sarah Haywood said:</span></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="We are delighted to offer the Introduction to Art Therapy short course. It is perfect for anyone who is interested in finding out about what art therapy is and understanding how it works. Art Therapy is an important way to help support people who have experienced serious trauma and help them articulate the experiences they have been through.  " source="Dr Sarah Haywood" sourceExtra="" />
<p><span>“Our course will give you a comprehensive introduction into the process and practice of Art Therapy. We invite a wide variety of art therapists to come and present their work within different client settings. This is an invaluable insight into how art therapists’ work. The course has a key experiential component to it, which encourages students engage in their own art making</span><span> and draw on their own </span><span>experiences to link with the theory taught on the course.</span> </p>
<p><span>“The four in-person workshops could be the perfect opportunity for people who are considering </span><span>working towards qualifying as an Art Psychotherapist</span> <span>– for example, people who might want to move on to studying the MSc Art Psychotherapy at Queen Margaret University.”</span> </p>
<p><span>Feedback for the short course has been overwhelmingly positive from those who have already completed it. Commenting on the course, one student said: “</span><span>Thank you again for being such a great facilitator on the short course; it really felt like everyone took something significant away with them and above all, we all thoroughly enjoyed it!”</span> </p>
<p><span>This short course costs £875, however, concessions are available to candidates depending on circumstances.
