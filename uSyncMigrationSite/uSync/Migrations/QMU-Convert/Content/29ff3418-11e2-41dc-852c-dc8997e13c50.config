      "title": "About the course",
      "content": "<p>Are you technically minded with an equally strong interest in person-centred care?</p>\n<p>Therapeutic radiography is a rewarding profession that brings together care and technological expertise. It is the skilled application of controlled amounts of radiation to treat medical conditions, mainly cancer and tumours. The therapeutic radiographer has shared responsibility for the planning and accurate delivery of radiation treatment.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to make a difference? As a therapeutic radiographer you will work with patients every day to help improve their care and their lives. You are a part of their journey, from initial referral through planning and treatment to the post treatment review. You will be a valued member of a multidisciplinary team providing a person-centred service. This course will equip you with the knowledge, understanding and critical thinking skills you need in this rewarding career.</p>\n<p>Year One modules include anatomy and physiology, scientific and technological therapeutic radiographic principles. You will prepare for clinical practice by developing your communication skills and exploring the professional requirements of a therapeutic radiographer. You will study radiotherapy treatment and commonly occurring cancers. To assist your transition into university there is a focus on academic skills including essay writing and how to access information. A two-week placement provides the opportunity to experience and integrate into the clinical environment.</p>\n<p>In Year Two you will undertake modules that explore the delivery of radiation treatment, therapeutic radiographic techniques including cross-sectional imaging, the management of patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment and cover more oncological sites. You will continue to broaden your understanding of health and wellbeing and how to influence behaviour change. Academic skills will be further developed by exploring the application of knowledge. You will develop your practical skills through 12 weeks of clinical placement.</p>\n<p>Year Three modules are designed to enhance your critical thinking and further develop your knowledge of less commonly occurring cancers and specialist therapeutic modalities. You will broaden your healthcare awareness and challenge your understanding of health education and promotion. You will continue to link theory and practice during 12 weeks of placement, which includes a two-week elective placement.</p>\n<p>Year Four provides the opportunity to enhance, consolidate and reflect on your theoretical, research, professional and clinical skills enabling a smooth transition to working life. You will explore leadership skills and innovative practice to meet current healthcare challenges. You will take ownership of your academic learning by undertaking a quality improvement project. This year involves 12 weeks of clinical placement, including a two-week elective placement.</p>\n<p>We aim for all our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member. This is the reason why we have implemented an interprofessional focus within all of our healthcare courses, including this one.</p>"
