<div class="column">
<p>The review schedule for the period noted below incorporates student facing professional services/services contributing to the quality of the student experience as determined by the University’s Student Experience Committee. The timescale for review is influenced by internal and external factors, including changes to the context within which the service is operating. The University will establish a five-year review schedule, but from time to time, the Student Experience Committee may also initiate a cross-cutting thematic review, involving more than one service. The process for any such review will broadly follow these guidelines and be confirmed by the Student Experience Committee at the time of determining the review focus. </p>

<p>The aims of the professional services review process are to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Provide staff of the professional service with an opportunity to reflect on its operation, successes, and challenges, since the most recent review.</li>
<li>Evaluate the extent to which provision meets the needs of identified stakeholders, typically including staff and students.</li>
<li>Evaluate the ways in which the service gathers feedback to monitor and improve the quality of provision.</li>
<li>Evaluate the contribution of the activities of the professional service to institutional strategic objectives.</li>
<li>Identify areas for enhancement and monitor action taken in response.</li>

<p>It is intended that the process should be positive and constructive, facilitating high quality debate and agreement. </p>
<p>Staff from the professional service area will have the opportunity to participate in the review process through preparation for the review meeting, participation in discussions with the review panel or both. Note that it is not within the remit of the panel to set conditions for the area under review.

<p>Approximately six months prior to the date of the review staff of the area under consideration will start on the preparation of the self-evaluation documentation. Staff from the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement will provide support and guidance throughout this process. The self-evaluation document must be submitted to the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement no later than four weeks before the confirmed review meeting date. </p>
<p>Members of the review panel will be invited to submit initial feedback, usually no later than one week before the meeting. This will be provided to the head of professional service to support the team with their preparations for the review meeting. A confirmed report of the review outcome will be available no later than four weeks after the review meeting, and a report will be submitted to the next scheduled meeting of the Student Experience Committee, and/or other senior committee(s), as appropriate. A date for a response to the review outcomes will be advised in the report. In the case of professional services review, it is expected that the service will report on progress as part of the strategic/operational planning process. </p>

<p>It is an expectation of the Scottish Funding Council that all universities review all aspects of provision on a cycle of no more than six years. The following guidelines set out the process for professional services review at QMU. The mechanism for review of academic programmes remains the five yearly internal subject review process, full details of which are available at the Validation and Review pages of our website. </p>
<p>Professional service review is intended to complement, build on and synthesise existing mechanisms for evaluating the effectiveness of our services.</p>]]></Value>
