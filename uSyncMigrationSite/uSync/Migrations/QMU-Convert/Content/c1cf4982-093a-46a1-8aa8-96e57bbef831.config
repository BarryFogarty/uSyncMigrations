      "content": "<p>Before making your application to the University, it is important to be aware of the costs involved in studying overseas i.e. the tuition fees and the living costs. It is essential to ensure you have organised funding prior to arriving in the UK, in particular if you are an international student and you need to apply for a Student visa.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding </strong></p>\n<p>There is a lot of competition for a limited amount of funding. The following information is suggested sources of funding. It must be noted that none of the following is guaranteed. Do not travel to the UK unless you are sure that you have the funds available to pay for your studies AND your living expenses, as it is extremely difficult to make funding arrangements once you have left your home country.</p>\n<p><strong>First stop for funding queries</strong></p>\n<p>1. The Ministry of Education or Education Department in your home country will have details of scholarship information for students who want to study overseas.<br />2. The website is an excellent resource for information on funding. Alternatively visit your local British Council office.<br />3.
