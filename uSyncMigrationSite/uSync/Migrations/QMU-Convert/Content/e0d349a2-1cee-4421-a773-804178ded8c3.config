      "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>During your first two years, you’ll join a diverse cohort of students, exploring the fundamental principles of speech and language therapy and gain hands-on practice experience through placement-based learning.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will move on to either the BSc (Hons) or the undergraduate Master’s pathway depending on your aspirations and performance. Both pathways develop professional skills, knowledge and attributes through a combination of university and placement-based learning. The undergraduate Master’s offer an opportunity to delve deeper into areas such as leadership, service improvement, research and public health, at a higher level.</p>\n<p><br />Upon graduation, both pathways lead to eligibility for registration with the HCPC, opening doors to a fulfilling career in speech and language therapy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars, practical workshops, and laboratories. Outside these timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a range of assessments throughout the course.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Practice placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will attend placements across Scotland in a variety of settings including hospitals, schools, and clinics to ensure you gain a range of experience at various locations. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Typically, in Years One and Two you will complete lifespan placements in early years and primary setting and a community placement in the voluntary/third sector. You will complete practice placements in Years Two, Three and Four. In addition, you will have an opportunity to attend a Peer Enhanced E-Placement. A simulated clinical placement experience, undertaken with your peers and supervised by a practice educator. You will attend a block placement in the summer period between Years Three and Four that is typically completed within four weeks. Summer placements take place across Scotland and the majority of students are required to travel outside the local area unless they have exceptional circumstances such as caring responsibilities. It is, therefore, likely that students will have to arrange alternative accommodation for the three-week duration of their placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
