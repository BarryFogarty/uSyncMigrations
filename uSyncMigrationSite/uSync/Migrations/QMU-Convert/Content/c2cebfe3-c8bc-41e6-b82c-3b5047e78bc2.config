      "content": "<p>The Division of Nursing has developed and embedded a person-centred ethos in the teaching and learning strategies across all programmes. We draw on the philosophical ideas of persons, personhood and person-centredness. This move from learner-centredness to person-centredness values the personhood of all persons equally. By creating an environment where learners and teaching staff engage in mutual learning, our approach is facilitative and consistent. We create learning environments where all persons feel engaged and able to commit to humanist and transformational learning processes, both in the classroom and online. Examples are facilitated groupwork, active learning, critical reflection, storytelling, poetry, work-based learning, skill rehearsal, critical creativity and contemplative education. This will be built on in the curriculum development of the online Graduate Diploma in Integrated Community Nursing . Whilst most of the learning will take place in the workplace, delivery of the academic elements of this programme will be entirely on line with opportunities to engage regularly with the teaching team and other students. Learners will agree an individual Learning Action Plan through tripartite discussion between themselves, their Clinical Guide and their Personal Academic Tutor at QMU. This will allow learners flexibility to define the competencies and other learning activities needed to develop their own practice. QMU has led on the delivery of this type of learning, and it is embedded in work-based modules across the School of Health Sciences. In addition to planned study time, learners will be expected to complete self-guided independent study. Assessments will be discussed at the beginning of each specific module.</p>"
