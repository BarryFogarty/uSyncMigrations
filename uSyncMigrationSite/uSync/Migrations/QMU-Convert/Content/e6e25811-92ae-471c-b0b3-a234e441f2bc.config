      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">1.0 - Aims and Objectives</span></p>
<p>The aim of this policy is to provide Managers and staff with guidance on secondment arrangements to ensure that these are undertaken fairly and consistently across Queen Margaret University and in accordance with equality and diversity principles.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">2.0 - Scope of Policy</span></p>
<p>This policy applies to all secondment arrangements within Queen Margaret University. <br /><br /></p>
<p><span class="lead">3.0 - Monitor and Review</span></p>
<p>Human Resources is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of this policy and supporting procedures and will conduct reviews at appropriate intervals. <br /><br />Any individual who feels they have been unfairly treated or discriminated against as part of secondment arrangements should contact Human Resources. <br /><br /><span class="lead">4.0 - Equal Opportunities</span></p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is committed to equality of opportunity for all staff and it is the responsibility of all QMU employees to promote “equality and diversity” in the application of this policy ensuring that there is no discrimination on the grounds of disability, race/ethnic origin, sex/gender, age, religion, marital/family status, dependency, sexual orientation, political opinion, and economic or social status.</p>
<p><span class="lead">5.0 - Responsibility for this Policy</span></p>
<p>Human Resources. <br /><br />Any changes to this policy and supporting procedures will be made in consultation with appropriate bodies. <br /><br />QMU reserves the right to update HR Policies in line with new or updated Employment Legislation.</p>
<p><span class="lead">6.0 - Definition of a Secondment </span></p>
<p>A secondment is where an employee temporarily transfers to work in a different area of QMU or to another organisation, for a fixed period of time, for a specific purpose, to the benefit of all parties.</p>
<p><span class="lead">7.0 - Advantages of Secondments  </span></p>
<p> For the Employee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondments offer valuable opportunities for staff development and allow employees to gain a broader understanding of other departments in QMU or associated external organisations.</li>
<li>Employees often receive the opportunity to enhance new skills and gain new experiences when working in a different area.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> For the Employer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing employees on secondment can ultimately increase organisational flexibility by developing a wide range of skills and knowledge in employees.</li>
<li>QMU may also benefit from sharing skills with external organisations, for example, the NHS. External secondments can enhance relationships with    other organisations.</li>
<li>Secondments provide employers with a means of dealing with short term pieces of work or projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span class="lead">8.0 - Secondment Circumstances  </span></p>
<p>Secondment arrangements may be considered in the following circumstances:</p>
<p><span class="lead">Project Pieces of Work:</span></p>
<p>A secondment opportunity often arises where a specific piece of work must be undertaken and achieved within a fixed time scale. <br /><br /><span class="lead">Vacancies pending permanent recruitment:</span></p>
<p>When a member of staff leaves there could be several reasons why it is not feasible to recruit into the vacant position on a permanent basis in the first instance, such as availability of suitable candidates, or recruitment which is pending a restructure of the School/Department. In such cases, it may be best to second an employee into the vacant post until permanent recruitment can commence. <br /><br /><span class="lead">Long Term Absence:</span></p>
<p>Where a member of staff is absent for a medium or long period of time or on maternity leave, the best option for cover of the position may be secondment. <br /><br /><span class="lead">Cover for Secondments:</span></p>
<p>If a member of staff is seconded to another School/Department or another organisation for a length of time then it may be necessary to second another individual into the vacant position for the duration of the secondment. <br /><br /><span class="lead">Cover for Acting Up Arrangements:</span></p>
<p>If a member of staff is acting up into another position within the School/Department for a length of time then it may be necessary to second another individual into the position into the position that is left vacant as a result of this.</p>
<p><span class="lead">9.0 - Types of Secondment  </span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Internal Secondment:</span> <br /><br />An internal secondment is when a QMU employee is temporarily transferred to another School/Department or where an employee is to undertake work different to their normal duties, such as a fixed term project, within their own department. The employee will be expected to return to their substantive position at the end of the secondment.</p>
<p><span class="lead">External Secondment (Outgoing):</span></p>
<p>An external outgoing secondment is when an individual remains an employee of QMU but is based within an external organisation for a fixed period of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the employee will be based within QMU for part of the week and based within the “host” organisation for part of the week.</li>
<li>The QMU employee will retain their QMU terms and conditions, including incremental rises, pay awards and their record of continuous service.</li>
<li>The QMU employee will continue to be paid via the QMU payroll.</li>
<li>The QMU employee should continue to report sickness absence and annual leave dates to QMU.</li>
<li>A secondment agreement (see Appendix 1) with the “host” organisation will be set up by Human Resources.</li>
<li>At the end of the secondment period the employee will return to their substantive position at QMU.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">External Secondment (Incoming):</span></p>
<ul>
<li>An external incoming secondment is when an individual from an external organisation is based within QMU for a fixed period of time.</li>
<li>In some cases, the employee will be based within QMU for part of the week and based within their own employer’s organisation for part of the week.</li>
<li>The individual will retain their terms and conditions with their own employer, including incremental rises, pay awards and their record of continuous service.</li>
<li>The individual will continue to be paid via their own employers payroll.</li>
<li>A secondment agreement (see Appendix 1) with the organisation providing the secondee organisation will be set up by Human Resources.</li>
<li>At the end of the secondment period the individual will return to their substantive position with their own employer.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">10.0 - Secondment Procedure  </span></p>
<p>Where it has been identified as necessary to second an employee into a position, the following procedure should be followed:</p>
<p><span class="lead">Establish Grade of the Secondment Position</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Manager should liaise with Human Resources to determine the grade of the secondment position.</li>
<li>If the secondment position is one which is already established within the staffing structure then grade of the position will already be known.</li>
<li>If the secondment position is a new position within the staffing establishment then the Manager should liaise with their HR Partner to create a suitable role profile document detailing the duties and responsibilities of the position in order for the grade to be scored and determined under the HERA (Job Evaluation) process. The HR Partner will advise the Manager of the appropriate grade.</li>
<li>In cases where the secondment role is on the same grade as the seconded employee’s substantive position then the seconded employee will receive an incremental rise of one point on the scale in recognition of their secondment.</li>
<li>Where the secondment is an External Secondment (Outgoing) the Manager should obtain the job description or role profile documents associated with the position from the host organisation. The Manager should pass these documents to their HR Partner who will score the position using the HERA method, determining the appropriate grade.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Determine the Duration of the Secondment</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Secondments vary in length, often between three months and two years, depending on the circumstances.</li>
<li>The Manager may be required to make an estimated judgement on the duration of the secondment period depending on the circumstances.</li>
<li>All parties affected by the secondment should be kept informed as far as possible on the likely duration.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Vacancy Approval Panel</span></p>
<ul>
<li>As they involve the filling or creation of positions, all secondments are dependent on approval through the Vacancy Approval Panel (VAP).</li>
<li>Once the Manager has identified a need for a secondment they should complete the Vacancy Approval Form (available on the HR Intranet page) and submit this to the relevant Executive Board member. If the Manager requires assistance to complete any part of the Vacancy Approval Form they should speak to their HR Partner.</li>
<li>The HR Partners will keep Managers informed of the forthcoming VAP submission and meeting dates. The outcome of each VAP meeting will be notified to Managers following the meeting.</li>
<li>Where VAP approves a secondment the Manager will automatically have permission to backfill the seconded employee’s substantive position. Backfilling of the substantive position must be by an employee who is either on the same or lower grade than the substantive position.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Filling the Secondment</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If there is one obvious single suitable employee who can be identified by the Manager as having the right skills for a defined project or piece of work then the secondment may be agreed with them directly. The secondment should be discussed in detail with the employee and the employee should be given a reasonable opportunity to consider the secondment.</li>
<li>Discussion on whether or not it is possible to second the employee should take place with the employee’s line Manager and their approval should be sought to release the employee to the secondment. Requests to second employees should not be unreasonably refused. Reasons for refusal should be communicated clearly.</li>
<li>Where the employee has requested to be seconded to a position and has been refused release from their line Manager, alternative development opportunities within their own School/Department should be suggested where possible.</li>
<li>If it is possible that more than one employee could be suitable for the secondment the seconding Manager should undertake a recruitment and selection process for the position. The Manager should liaise with their HR Partner to determine if recruitment should be internal or external. The Manager must also liaise with their HR Partner at this stage to establish if there are any suitable individuals currently on the Redeployment Register who may wish to express an interest in the acting up position.</li>
<li>The Manager should refer to the Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedure on the HR Intranet site for guidance on undertaking this process.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Appointment</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Manager should liaise with their HR Partner to determine an appropriate scale point upon which to appoint the employee.</li>
<li>If the employee is seconded to a position which is of a higher grade than their substantive position, they must have been in the seconded position for a minimum of six months to be awarded an incremental scale point rise on 1st April.</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal Secondments</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a suitable candidate for the secondment position has been identified, whether they have undergone a recruitment and selection process or not, an Amendment to Contract form should be completed and submitted to Human Resources.</li>
<li>Human Resources will issue a contract amendment letter to the employee, detailing the secondment arrangements, including any alterations to the employee’s existing terms and conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>External Secondments (Incoming)<span class="lead"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Where the most suitable candidate has been identified via an external recruitment and selection campaign, the Manager should complete the New Employee Appointment Form and submit it to Human Resources at the end of the recruitment campaign.</li>
<li>The recruiting Manager should liaise with the Finance Office with regards to payment of external secondment arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Induction and Training</span></p>
<p>Internal Secondments</p>
<ul>
<li>A local induction appropriate to the secondment position and the current experience of the seconded employee should be undertaken by the seconding Manager.</li>
<li>Upon commencement of secondment the Manager should follow the Performance Enhancement Review guidance to discuss with the employee their forthcoming activities and objectives and identify appropriate development opportunities. Reviews should be undertaken in accordance with the Performance Enhancement Review policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />External Secondments</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the seconded employee is based in a new organisation the seconded employee should be invited to the next available corporate induction day so that they can be informed of the background, culture and procedures of the organisation.</li>
<li>A local induction within the School/Department should also be undertaken by the seconding Manager.</li>
<li>If the seconded employee does not have all the relevant skills and experience required to fully perform the duties of the position then appropriate support and development must be put in place by the Manager to manage the disparity and equip the employee with the skills required as soon as possible. The Manager should liaise with their HR Partner if they require further advice on this.</li>
<li>Upon commencement of External Secondments (Outgoing) the Manager should follow the Performance Enhancement Review guidance to discuss with the employee their forthcoming activities and objectives on their secondment and identify appropriate development opportunities. The Manager should have regular contact with the host organisation to enable reviews to be undertaken in accordance with the Performance Enhancement Review policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Health and Safety</span></p>
<p>It is expected that any seconded employee, either internal or external, will take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves and of any other persons who may be affected by his acts or emissions at work. It is also expected that the seconded employee will co-operate with the external Seconder in complying with any relevant statutory regulation. Whilst on QMU premises the seconded employee must comply with the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (including Regulations issued thereunder).</p>
<p><span class="lead">Maintaining Contact</span></p>
<p>For the duration of the secondment, the seconded employee should maintain some contact with their substantive School/Department to ensure continuity when they return to their substantive post. <br /><br /> Suitable contact would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retaining the seconded employee on mailing lists for team communications.</li>
<li>Seconded employees being advised/consulted on restructuring or significant departmental changes.</li>
<li>Seconded employees attending significant team meetings or away days with their substantive department.</li>
<li>Continued review of personal development (or other development plan for individuals seconded from external organisations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting up arrangements will be reviewed at monthly establishment meetings by the HR Partner and the Manager. <br /><br /></p>
<p><span class="lead">Extensions to Secondments</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Extensions to secondments should be fully discussed with the seconded employee as early as possible.</li>
<li>Agreement for extension should be sought from the substantive line Manager as early as possible as they may have planned the future performance of the School/Department based on the assumption that the seconded employee would be returning on a specific date. They may also be required to extend any backfill which they have arranged in the substantive position.</li>
<li>If an employee is to be seconded for longer than was originally anticipated then the seconding Manager should submit an Amendment to Contract Form to Human Resources to ensure the secondment arrangements continue. Human Resources will write to the employee confirming the extension of the secondment.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Ending Secondments</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The seconded employee, their substantive line Manager and Human Resources should be kept continually informed of when the secondment is likely to come to an end.</li>
<li>When a secondment comes to an end the Manager should submit an Amendment to Contract Form to Human Resources indicating that the employee has returned to their substantive post and the effective date of this change.</li>
<li>The seconded employee is entitled to revert to their substantive post. Planning for the return should ideally commence no later than four weeks before the date of return. If the seconded employee has been absent from their substantive position for a significant period of time then re-induction and re-training may need to be considered, especially if significant changes have occurred within the School/Department in their absence.</li>
<li>When returning to their substantive position, seconded employees will revert to their substantive grade and scale point. The scale point employees are placed on must reflect any incremental rises that would have been incurred if the employee had remained in their substantive position during the secondment period.</li>
<li>When seconded employees return to their substantive position it is possible they may feel demotivated or as if they have taken a step backwards in their career. Therefore it is important for Managers to discuss future development with them as soon as possible, even if this is outwith their normal cyclical timescales of Activity Planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">11.0 - Backfilling the Seconded Employee’s Position </span></p>
<p>Options to cover the seconded employee’s substantive position should be considered as early as possible. <br /><br />Options to fill this gap could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redistribution of workload throughout the remaining team.</li>
<li>Backfilling with a temporary employee.</li>
<li>Backfilling with another secondee.</li>
<li>Acting up of another individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers may find it helpful to refer to the Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedure to backfill the substantive position.</p>
