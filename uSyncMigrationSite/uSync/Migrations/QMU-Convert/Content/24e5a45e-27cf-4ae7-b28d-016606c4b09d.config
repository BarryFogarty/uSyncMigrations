<p><span class="lead">1.0 Introduction</span></p>
<p>The University’s Contribution Pay Policy and supporting procedures are part of our overall Reward and Recognition Policy. The University wishes to recognise and reward the contribution members of staff make to the implementation of the strategic plan.</p>
<p><span class="lead">2.0 Policy Aims</span></p>
<p>This policy and supporting procedures are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance career progression opportunities of all staff</li>
<li>Support the recruitment and retention of staff</li>
<li>Reward staff whose contribution on a sustained basis exceeds that normally expected in their role</li>
</ul>
<p>A contribution pay award is in respect of a staff member’s contribution to the delivery of the University’s strategic plan objectives. Senior members of staff who are not part of the University’s pay and grading structure are covered by separate contribution pay arrangements.</p>
<p>Senior members of staff who are not part of the University's pay and grading structure are covered by separate contribution pay arrangements. </p>
<p>Please refer to the Reward and Recognition Policy for membership of the Reward and Recognition Committee.</p>
<p><span class="lead">3.0 Equal Opportunities</span></p>
<p>QMU is committed to equality of opportunity for all its staff and the terms of this policy and its supporting procedures and guidance notes are designed to ensure the fair and transparent treatment for all staff irrespective of age, race, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, sexual orientation, religion or belief, gender or contractual status.</p>
<p><span class="lead">4.0 Contribution Pay Awards</span></p>
<p>The Reward and Recognition Committee invites applications from staff for the award of a contribution increment; or one-off payment.</p>
<p>Contribution pay awards are only applicable to staff who, at the submission date, have at least 12 months continuous service in their current post within the university. </p>
<p>Contribution Pay is not the appropriate route where the role has been developed to the extent that it fits within a higher grade. These instances will be managed via Role Review.</p>
<p>Recognition of academic achievement in the form of the award, e.g. a Senior Lectureship should be progressed under the QMU Academic Promotion Policy.</p>
<p>Applications will not normally be accepted from employees who have a current disciplinary sanction on record or performance improvement plan in place.</p>
<p><span class="lead">5.0 Evaluation Criteria</span></p>
<p>The Reward and Recognition Committee will consider applications based on the criteria set out below. Exceptional performance in conjunction with the objectives agreed in the Performance Enhancement Review (PER) process are expected.</p>
<p>Examples of contribution criteria are excellence in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The delivery of innovative and high quality customer service</li>
<li>Enhanced productivity maximising the use of resources in support of the delivery of financial sustainability</li>
<li>Continuous professional development contributing to the delivery of sustained additional individual or team contribution</li>
<li>Consistent and sustained excellent service delivery</li>
<li>External representation resulting in the enhancement of the University’s/School’s/area’s reputation in accordance with strategic plan objectives.</li>
<li>Learning and teaching/leadership in learning and teaching in accordance with direction set by the Student Experience Strategy</li>
<li>Research and/or research leadership in accordance with the provisions of our Research Development Strategy</li>
<li>Entrepreneurial and other profitable income generating activity in line with the provisions of our Commercialisation Strategy</li>
<li>Academic leadership, management &amp; administration</li>
<li>Recruitment of students in line with the growth objectives set out in the strategic plan</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications should demonstrate that the member of staff has exceeded the normal contribution required as set out in the job description and other relevant criteria that are in place.</p>
<p>The application needs to show a clear link between the contribution made and the University’s strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Applicants may discuss their application with Human Resources who will provide further advice and guidance as required.</p>
<p><span class="lead">6.0 Contribution Awards – Definitions</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">6.1 Contribution Increment</span></p>
<p>A member of staff is eligible for a contribution increment where they are already being paid at the maximum point of the standard part of their scale or being paid within the contribution part of the scale. The Reward and Recognition Committee may recommend the award of a contribution increment where there is evidence to show that a staff member has consistently demonstrated exceptional performance. Where successful, one increment will be awarded.</p>
<p><span class="lead">6.2 Accelerated Scale Increments</span></p>
<p>A member of staff is eligible for an accelerated scale increment if they are below the normal maximum point of their salary scale. Accelerated increments do not apply where the employee is being paid within the contribution range of the salary scale.</p>
<p>The Reward and Recognition Committee may recommend the award of an accelerated increment where a staff member:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is developing or progressing within their role at a faster rate than would normally be expected and is making a greater contribution to the objectives agreed</li>
<li>Has taken on additional responsibility, on an on-going basis beyond that which is required as part of a normal development plan, as described in the PER process, and where the level of responsibility falls within their current grade Where successful, one additional increment will be awarded.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">6.3 One Off Payments</span></p>
<p>A one off payment may be awarded by the Reward and Recognition Committee where a staff member is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributing to the successful management/delivery of an exceptionally challenging project or identifiable piece of work making an exceptional contribution in the process</li>
<li>Achieves particularly challenging goals overcoming significant challenges in the process</li>
<li>Demonstrating exceptional flexibility in responding to deadlines/changes in targets which contributes directly to School/Department objectives as described in the individuals PER.</li>
<li>A one-off payment is a flat rate limp sum of £750.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications normally cover evidence (as described above) within the 12 months previous to the application deadline (31 January 2022). As Reward and Recognition did not take place during 20/21, one off payment applications for this year may include evidence covering the period from January 2020 to January 2022.</p>
<p>A one off payment award is non-pensionable but is subject to tax and national insurance deductions. A one off payment is not a substitution for any overtime payments.</p>
<p>It would be exceptional for a member of staff to receive such an award for the same or very similar reasons in consecutive years.</p>
<p><span class="lead">7.0 Timetable</span></p>
<p>The reward and Recognition Committee normally meets annually to consider Contribution Pay applications. Each year Human Resources publish a set of procedures and a supporting timetable for the Reward and Recognition Policy.</p>
<p><span class="lead" style="font-size: 16px;">8.0 The Procedure</span></p>
<p>The role of the Reward and Recognition Committee is to carry out an evaluation of the application against the criteria set out in the policy. The Committee will normally approve only applications where the applicant has demonstrated a level of performance which is greater than expected and where the appropriate member of the Executive Board has recommended it for approval.</p>
<p>Applicants should set out the basis of their submission clearly and succinctly setting out the achievements against the criteria. It is also important that the applicant is explicit in setting out their specific contribution to the activities reported in the application.</p>
<p>The application should be accompanied by the applicants up to date PER.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.1 Employee/Manager Discussion</span></p>
<p>When a member of staff is considering making an application, the first step is to review the criteria set out in the Contribution Pay Policy. They should then arrange to meet with their Line Manager to discuss a potential application. In preparation for that meeting the applicant is encouraged to carry out a self-assessment exercise against the criteria. This will form a helpful basis for the discussion. The applicant also needs to discuss with the Line Manager the type of contribution pay award they wish to apply for i.e. a contribution increment, accelerated scale increment or one-off payment. Having had this initial discussion the applicant needs to consider whether they wish to proceed with an application.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.2 Application Form</span></p>
<p>The application process for a contribution pay award is based on the completion of the Contribution Pay Application Form. The application form should be accessed via YourContribution.</p>
<p>The form needs to be completed by the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicant</li>
<li>Line Manager</li>
<li>Senior Leadership Member (confirmation process has been followed correctly only)</li>
</ul>
<p>The applicant should only apply for one award. The Reward and Recognition Committee has the discretion to adjust the award, e.g. an accelerated increment in place of a one-off payment if that was deemed to be more appropriate. There are prompt questions on the form to help with its completion. Once completed the application should submit to their line manager via YourContribution.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.3 Line Manager Actions</span></p>
<p>Following receipt of an application, the line manager should add their comments via YourContribution. The line manager should comment on their assessment of the applicant’s achievements. Where the application is unsupported, the line manager should discuss the rationale for this with the employee before adding their comments to the application. Once completed the line manager should submit to the EB member via YourContribution.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.4 Senior Leadership Team Member Actions</span></p>
<p>The Senior Leadership Team member will review the application form and confirm that the process has been followed by adding their confirmation on the form and submitting to HR. </p>
<p><span class="lead">8.5 Notification of Outcomes</span></p>
<p>Once the committee has made their decision, Human Resources will write to all applicants in accordance with the annually published Contribution Pay timetable. Awards are effective from 1st August each year.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.6 Feedback</span></p>
<p>Feedback on the outcome of applications will be provided via the relevant Senior Keadership Team member or line Manager. If the application is unsuccessful the staff member will be told of the reasons on which the decision has been based. Where applicable, all feedback should form a core part of future PER discussions.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.7 Appeals</span></p>
<p>The appeals procedure can be used where an applicant considers there has been an procedural irregularity which has caused them to be treated unfairly. The appeals procedure cannot be used to query the judgement reached on the application. Unsuccessful applicants wishing to appeal should attend their feedback meeting with the relevant Senior Leadership Team member or Line Manager first.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.7.1 Appeals Process</span></p>
<p>Appeals should be made in writing and submitted to the Head of HR within fifteen working  days of receipt of the outcome letter. The Head of HR will arrange for a member of the Senior Management Team to consider the appeal in conjunction with all relevant documentation. </p>
<p>The written appeal must clearly explain the alleged procedural irregularity and the way in which this has affected the outcome.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.7.2 Appeal Decisions and Outcome</span></p>
<p>The appeal will not re-assess the entire case but it will consider whether the procedure has been properly applied. If it is judged that a procedural irregularity has occurred, the appeal shall only be considered if the irregularity gives rise to reasonable doubt as to whether the relevant committee would have reached the same decision had it not occurred.</p>
<p>If an appeal is upheld then the matter will be referred back to the relevant decision making committee for reconsideration of the substantive case following the correct procedure. The member of staff hearing the appeal do not have delegated authority to vary the original outcome or decision.</p>
<p>The following outcomes may apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>The appeal is not upheld</li>
<li>The appeal is upheld, and the appropriate award will be made if warranted on the evidence provided</li>
<li>The appeal is upheld, and there is no change i.e. the circumstances presented in the appeal are judged to have had no material effect on the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Written notification of the decision will normally be given to the appellant in writing within 20 working days of receipt of the appeal letter, unless otherwise notified. The outcome of the appeal is final. </p>
<p><span class="lead">9.0 Mitigating Circumstances Process</span></p>
<p>Applicants are encouraged to indicate any personal circumstances that may have affected their performance by reducing the volume or range of activities that you were able to undertake. As a general guide circumstances impacting a period of less than six months should not be reported under this process. A Mitigating Circumstances Form is available via YourContribution.</p>
<p>A range of personal circumstances can be taken into account. Some examples are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absences due to maternity, adoption, parental or carers leave</li>
<li>Periods of part-time working</li>
<li>Breaks in employment due to non-consecutive fixed term contracts </li>
<li>Disability, including temporary incapactiy that lasts for more than six months</li>
<li>Absence due to ill-health or injury</li>
<li>Absences for more than six consecutive months (e.g. career breaks)</li>
<li>Special leave of absence or secondment to other organisations</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p>Applicants need to explain how your circumstances have affected your performance and may be required to provide evidence to support the application. This information will only be seen by Human Resources who will advise the Reward and Recognition Committee on how this may have affected the application.</p>]]></Value>
