It will enable you to prepare for work in health care which involves collaborate working and unpredictable situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice-based Learning: </strong>The main learning in this module will take place in clinical settings. This includes the Scottish ambulance service and other clinical environments e.g. Hospital, care homes and third sector. It will give you the opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge to practice, observe and learn from clinicians in practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Year Two</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pharmacology:</strong> This module will provide you with knowledge about medications and their actions to help you develop understanding of how and why paramedics use medications in the prehospital environment. We will introduce you to the principles of drug administration, drug action, pharmacological therapy and the rationale for treatments. In this module you will be able to build on the knowledge of physiological systems gained in year 1 and relate this to pharmacological interventions, which is very important for future paramedic practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Using Clinical Assessment and Decision Making in Paramedic Practice:</strong> This module will build on knowledge gained in year 1 to further develop your approach to clinical assessment and decision making. In Year Two you will learn to use clinical assessment and decision making in paramedic practice and to initiate and document appropriate actions in a wide range of contexts. This module will help you to use knowledge of altered physiology. You will learn about signs, symptoms, diagnostics and differentials to inform paramedic assessment. You will draw on relevant theory to help you to understand principles of safe, effective and person centred clinical decision making and care planning to care for, refer or transfer people requiring paramedic care. In this module we will debate approaches to the assessment and management of risk in paramedic practice and how to analyse the impact of multi-professional and multi-agency working.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour change:</strong> Part of the evolving paramedic role involves empowering others to live well and make positive changes to their health. This module will help you to develop skills in communication and health coaching for supporting behaviour change, health and well-being of individuals and groups. You will learn about determinants of health and health inequalities and their impact on individuals and groups.

In this module you will be also explore the evidence for behaviour change interventions, and sustainable strategies to empower and facilitate behaviour change. This module will help you to apply theory to practice by completing a health coaching intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills for Paramedic Practice 2:</strong> In this module you will enhance and extend your repertoire of skills for paramedic practice introduced in Year One. This module will enable you to develop further confidence and competence in the application of professional skills for safe, effective and person-centred paramedic practice under minimal supervision. In year 2 we will integrate physiological, pharmacological, psychological and sociocultural knowledge to inform your safe application of paramedic skills in a wide range of contexts. You will continue to learn within our clinical skills facilities at QMU using simulation and virtual reality technology which re-create real-life conditions for assessment and care. In this module we will use scenarios to apply a range of effective communication skills with a particular focus on persons with a variety of communication needs. You will continue to learn about use and how to safely apply specialist equipment relevant to the paramedic role and we will discuss its use in practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Paramedic Practice-based Learning 2:</strong> This module is will take place in clinical settings in Edinburgh, Lothian and the Borders regions. Practice-based learning opportunities will take place in includes the Scottish ambulance service and other clinical environments including Hospital, care homes and third sector. Building on the practice-based learning experiences gained in year 1 you will continue to have opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge to practice, observe and learn from clinicians in practice as well as participating in direct care of persons.</p>\n<p><strong>Developing a Spirit of Enquiry:</strong> This module will help you to develop the skills required for a critical and enquiring approach to professional practice and further develop the skills developed in Finding your Academic Voice in Year One. You will explore concepts of ethics in the context of generating knowledge to inform paramedic practice and how to debate the strengths and limitations of differing types of evidence. We will help you to select and use information from published literature in order to make and argue a case. You will also learn how to identify the different approaches to knowledge generation and weigh up their value for professional practice. This module is very important for your understanding of evidence based paramedic practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Year Three</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Managing Complexity in Paramedic Practice:</strong> This is the core paramedic module in year 3 and will prepare you to manage clinical challenges autonomously, safely and effectively in complex, unfamiliar or unpredictable circumstances within the scope of paramedic practice. You will learn how to justify effective problem solving, clinical judgement and decision making in paramedic practice in a wide range of contexts in relation to evidence. You will learn how to confidently interpret and prioritise the findings from assessment and to determine the appropriate diagnosis, treatment, referral or discharge of persons requiring care. You will learn how to critically evaluate strategies and responses to manage major incidents and complex situations including trauma and persons with deterioration. We will evaluate together the impact of leadership and team working in paramedic practice and you will learn how to facilitate and promote approaches for supported self- management with people in a holistic and person centred manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Paramedic Practice –based Learning 3:</strong> This module is undertaken within the clinical setting and will enable you to consolidate your knowledge and clinical skills in preparation for autonomous paramedic practice following registration. This module will give you an opportunity to practice how to modify and adapt clinical assessment and practice to safely meet the needs of persons, minimising risk and promoting shared decision making, while considering the diverse cultural socioeconomic, physical and mental health needs of the population.
