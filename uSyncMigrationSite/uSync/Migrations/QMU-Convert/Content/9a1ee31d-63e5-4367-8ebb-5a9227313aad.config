These opportunities are offered by many of the world-famous organisations that are based in Edinburgh (eg the Edinburgh International Festival or the International Film Festival). Although we support students to find opportunities, you are required to secure your own arrangements in line with your personal interests. As we are in Edinburgh, the world’s first and best Festival City, there are no end of opportunities in this regards, and we are well regarded by our industry peers: many of our alumni work in these organisations now and advocate for us. If you are already working in the sector, you can use your existing employment as the site for your industry-based learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>The three modules would require approximately four days of on-campus learning each semester, meaning that the PgCert could be completed within 12-14 days of intensive study that is spread over the course of a year.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Normally, there are around 30-35 students enrolling on the course each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

Students will examine different leadership strategies and critically interrogate how governance forms and guides cultural organisations. The assessments include an essay and a strategic analysis. </p>\n<p><strong>Fundraising, Finance and Development (20 credits): </strong>This module will equip students with a critical understanding of the principles and practices of fundraising, development and financial management. The assessments invite students to examine financial support mechanisms (eg, completing a funding application or designing a sponsorship pack) as well as financial literacy exam. This module marks our course as quite unique in this regards. </p>\n<p><strong>Arts Management in Practice (20 credits): </strong>This module will support students to become reflective practitioners, confident in their ability to employ and adapt theory in relation to the organisational contexts in which they may work. Students will attend field trips and receive experts in the field who will talk about their practical realities as cultural managers. This is the module that also houses the ‘industry based experience’ element OR</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluating Cultural Projects (20 credits): </strong>This module will provide students with the knowledge and understanding to effectively design and execute the evaluation of arts and cultural projects. A very student-driven module, this is an optional choice instead of Arts Management in Practice and can only be taken if a real-time Cultural Project is occurring that the student can access. </p>\n<p>NB The modules listed are correct at time of posting (December 2023) but are subject to change.
