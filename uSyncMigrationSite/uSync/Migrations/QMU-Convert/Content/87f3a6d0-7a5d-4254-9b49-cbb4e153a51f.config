      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Still sweating after my shower at the Uni gym, I sat in Maggie’s Bar throwing back a Bacon Roll and Coffee. Just over two pounds, I couldn’t believe it!</p>
<p>Heather and I had agreed to meet each other to discuss potential funding for my exchange. I had no idea what this was, how much we were talking about and what I would need to do to obtain it. We had also agreed to meet on email so I was extra stressed as I didn’t know what she looked like. Luckily at 09.30 on Friday morning the union wasn’t buzzing, I happened to be the only one there.</p>
<p>After pleasantries I filled in Heather where I had been up till now and why I wanted to do an exchange. Heather was very helpful and thorough when informing me of several funding opportunities, most importantly the Santander Fund. Once again I left with a beaming smile on my face. Heather had agreed to offer me funding to support my exchange. In return I agreed I would support her in the future to help students with any queries they may have with regards to an exchange.</p>
<p>University picked, Modules selected, finances managed and my wife has already looked at flights for her holiday whilst I’m there.</p>
<p>So to answer my original question….</p>
<p>Can I do an exchange to the United States when I am 28 years old, married, have a mortgage to pay and have a job?…</p>
<p>Hell yes I can.</p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time in this blog thus far talking about worries I had, how I would survive 3000 miles away with commitments at home and can I really manage the work load? Let’s not forget although I will study and be assessed to contribute towards my degree, I will also be in Pennsylvania!</p>
<p>I can watch the American Football when it is intended to be watched on a Sunday. I can indulge myself in a culture I have been fascinated since going to Seattle in 2002. I can eat American food, drink American drink and be loved by everyone just because I’m Scottish. Everybody loves a Scot. Yeah?</p>
<p>It’s not only about the academic experience, it’s all about the life experience and potential career opportunities post QMU.</p>
<p>I hope this blog has been useful to answer any worries anyone may have about looking to find out more about an exchange. The team at RILO are the experts however I thought it would be helpful to share my experience over the last month as I thought, I could never do this. Now I’m off to Pennsylvania for 16 weeks!</p>
<p>I will update this blog regularly from now until I return from my exchange in May 2017. I will also post more leading up to my exchange to share my experience with QMU and the students taking there valuable drinking time to read my blog!</p>
<p>Thanks again for reading and I’ll check in soon.</p>]]></Value>
