      "content": "<p>My academic background is in Visual Cultures, I studied a PhD at Goldsmiths, University of London, using autoethnography and the work of Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari to research on the impact of neoliberalism onto Western subjectivity and to explore forms of collective organising to counter that impact.</p>\n<p>This research led me to initiate and take part in self-organised collectives, often inspired by feminist theories and practices of care and the commons – in particular Silvia Federici and Midnight Notes collective.</p>\n<p>Through these experiences, which took place in London, Italy and Spain, I developed an interest in community and collective care that motivated me to train as an art therapist. Since that training I have been interested in bringing social change at the heart of therapeutic practices and I believe creativity, the nonverbal and the somatic aspects of the arts therapies can have an important role in doing that. </p>\n<p>I’ve been working as an art therapist in different contexts, in therapeutic communities, homeless hostels, schools, acute wards and rehabs, in community centres, forensic settings, in people’s homes and in private practice with the Free Psychotherapy Network.</p>\n<p>I have been offering art therapy experientials to collectives and community organisations, encouraging creativity and nonverbal expression in addressing organisational and power dynamics.</p>\n<p>I am currently training as a systemic practitioner with the Family Therapy Training Network in Glasgow and I have a specific interest in Narrative Therapy and in supporting the construction of “scripts” alternative to the dominant discourses marked by oppression and discrimination – hetero-patriarchy, white supremacy, ableism in particular.</p>\n<p>I am interested in in affirming difference and exploring the queer and queering aspects of arts therapies, I am passionate about working with GSRD, Gender, Sexuality, Relationship diversity, I identify as queer and my pronouns are he or they.</p>"
