The use of another person’s work, by simply changing a few words or altering the order of presentation without acknowledgement also counts as plagiarism. Less obviously, it can also mean a student presenting the same assessment on a multiple of occasions.</p>\n<p>In the following circumstances, academic collusion represents a form of plagiarism: Academic collusion is deemed to be unacceptable where it involves the unauthorised and unattributed collaboration of students or others work resulting in plagiarism, which is against University discipline.</p>\n<p>Should it be suspected, then the alleged plagiarism will be dealt with through the University’s processes, and could lead to a student being withdrawn from the University.  </p>\n<p>Academic staff, Library Services and Effective Learning Services staff will offer guidance and support to help you develop good academic practices and to conduct your studies with academic integrity.
