Completed forms should be sent to the <a href=\"mailto:graduateschool@qmu.ac.uk\"></a><strong><a href=\"mailto:graduateschool@qmu.ac.uk\">Graduate School team</a> </strong>(cc'd to supervisors).</p>\n<p><strong>All forms related to changes to your studies can be found on <a href=\"https://canvas.qmu.ac.uk/courses/4503\" title=\"Canvas link\">CANVAS. </a></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Extension to Probationary Assessment Deadline</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you are unable to meet the 6-8 (or 12-16) month deadline for your probationary assessment, please make a request for an extension by completing a Probationary Assessment Extension Request form.  Please ensure you provide justification for your request and explain why you have not been able to submit your probationary report within the regulatory time frame. This form should be completed by you and supported by your supervisory team.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Suspension of Study</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you are prevented from making due progress by ill-health, or another significant cause, you may apply to suspend your studies for up to 12 months in the first instance. A request for suspension on medical grounds must be supported by a letter from your doctor. The maximum total period of suspension in any programme period is 24 months. No fee is payable during a full year of continuous suspension. Suspension requests should not be made retrospectively, therefore it is important to be proactive in submitting your application. The form should be completed by you and supported by your supervisory team.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Change in Mode of Study</strong></span></p>\n<p>You may apply to change your mode of study from full-time to part-time or vice versa if you have good cause.

For example, this may be the case if a member of your team has any long term leave planned such as maternity leave or research leave, or in the event that a supervisor experiences a longer than three month absence due to unforeseen circumstances. It may also be appropriate to request additional supervisors if they can offer an area of expertise that is required for your research project. A Change in Supervision form should be completed by a member of the supervisory team.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Extension to Programme Registration</strong></span></p>\n<p>An application for an extension to the period of study beyond the maximum (4 years full-time and 8 years part-time) may only be made in the most exceptional circumstances.  You will be expected to provide relevant evidence to support your request and may be invited to meet with a member of the Graduate School Academic Board to discuss the request. An Extension Request form should be completed by you and supported by your supervisory team.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Withdrawal</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you are considering withdrawing from the doctoral programme please contact your supervisory team and/or the Graduate School Team.  If you decide to withdraw, a Withdrawal form should be completed by you and supported by your supervisory team.</p>"

This annual amount is divided into equal monthly payments which are paid directly into candidates bank accounts via BACS transfer on the 25th of each month.</p>\n<p>Full time candidates will receive the bursary amount for 36 months.

Any material items or equipment purchased from this budget remain the property of the School.</p>\n<p>A maximum of £1000 may be spent in the first year, and the remainder will be carried forward to the second year, when an additional £600 becomes available. PhD candidates may carry forward any money remaining from this £1600 to their third year, when the final £400 will become available (or pro rata for part time candidates).</p>\n<p>The research budget lasts for the duration of the prescribed period of study only.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Fees</strong></span></p>\n<p>The University waives tuition and bench fees for bursary holders.
