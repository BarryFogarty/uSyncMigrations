      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>THANKS TO GENEROUS donations from alumni, friends and staff, our </strong><strong>students have the opportunity to make the most of their time at QMU </strong><strong>and develop their potential in a much wider sense.</strong></p>
<p>Sport enriches our students’ lives. Aside from the physical health benefits, it allows our students to make new friendships and build vital skills to help them on their career journeys.</p>
<p>This is one reason why we are grateful to everyone who supports the Vice-Chancellor’s &amp; Student Development Fund. In recent years, the Fund has helped students involved in basketball, dance, football, Gaelic football, netball and sailing.</p>
<p>Another club that has benefited from the Vice-Chancellor’s &amp; Student Development Fund over the years is the Sapphires, QMU’s official cheerleading team. Sapphires President and Occupational Therapy student, Charne Thorp, tells us more about the squad.</p>
<p>“Our 39 member squad is open to all skill levels. We have a competition team and Level 1, 2 and 3 stunt teams. The teams take part in competitions run by BCA Cheer &amp; Dance, and compete against other university teams in the BUCS league.</p>
<p>“The competition team is different from the stunt teams, as their routines are longer and feature dance, jumps, tumbles, as well as stunts.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Our recreational team allows members to learn and develop cheerleading skills in a fun, relaxed environment. It’s great for those trying cheerleading for the first time or building skills. Some members will try out for the competition and stunt teams after training with the recreational team. It’s lovely to see that progression." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>“An exciting new edition to the squad is our pom duo.”</p>
<p>Cheerleading is an enjoyable way to stay fit and healthy but the sport helps students in a much broader sense. It builds life skills such as communication, perseverance and teamwork. Committee members also get the chance to develop their budgeting, leadership, planning and organisational skills. Important skills they need for their future careers.</p>
<p>With kit, training costs, competition fees, and then travelling to and from competitions, cheerleading is expensive.</p>
<p>Charne explained. “Our uniform alone costs £125, and then there are shoes, bows, and other expenses to ensure we look our best on competition day.</p>
<p>“We’re competing all over the country too, so travel and accommodation costs are high.</p>
<p>“We’re very grateful to everyone who supports the Vice-Chancellor’s &amp; Student Development Fund. Without it, some of us wouldn’t be able to do a sport we love.”</p>
<p>With the end of the competition year nearing, the squad is now turning their attentions to their annual showcase in April, which is in its tenth year.</p>
<p>Charne concluded: “The competition is our largest fundraiser with the funds raised supporting next year’s squad.</p>
<p>“It’s a great way to celebrate the end of the year. It helps our squad grow their friendships with cheerleading squads from other universities, as well as raising the profile of cheerleading to the wider QMU community.”</p>]]></Value>
