Podiatrists work with their patients to prevent and correct deformity, keeping people mobile and active, and helping to relieve pain. Podiatrists work with people of all ages, and your patients will count on you to support and help them with a broad range of mobility and medical conditions of the foot and lower limbs. These may include muscle and joint problems as well as broader health issues such as diabetes, blood disorders and disorders of the nervous system, which may involve complex wound management.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn from research-active staff with an outstanding reputation for the quality of teaching;</li>\n<li>be equipped with all the knowledge and skills that you require to work as a podiatrist;</li>\n<li>develop your expertise through in-depth theoretical learning, clinical placements in each year and the close support of our very experienced staff;</li>\n<li>benefit from the interprofessional working focus of this course; and</li>\n<li>become confident in your own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member.</li>\n</ul>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>During your first two years, you'll join a diverse cohort of students, exploring the fundamental principles of podiatry and gaining hands-on practice experience through placement-based learning within health and social care.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will move on to either the BSc (Hons) or the undergraduate master’s pathway depending on your aspirations and performance. Both pathways develop professional skills, knowledge and attributes through a combination of university and placement-based learning. The undergraduate masters offer an opportunity to delve deeper into areas such as leadership, service improvement, research and public health, at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Upon graduation, both pathways lead to eligibility for registration with the HCPC, opening doors to a fulfilling career in podiatry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will learn in face-to-face and online lectures, seminars, tutorials and practical workshops. There will be a mix of classroom and online learning. Outwith timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue your own learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of assessment methods (for example written and practical exams, written assignments, presentations) at the end of each module.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will complete practice placements in each year. You will attend a variety of placements within the NHS at various locations across Scotland. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employability placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern specialist spaces for use by our podiatry courses. We have a large multipurpose clinical room, a large orthotics laboratory with a separate machine room, and a fully functioning surgical suite which are all used to facilitate student learning and our on-campus patient-facing clinics. On-campus staff-supported clinics which we operate within the aforementioned spaces include: nail surgery clinics, nail surgery assessment and dressings clinics, and musculoskeletal/biomechanics clinics. We also provide simulated learning experiences within our clinical spaces to enable students to safely develop complex skills which can then be transferred into the practice education/clinical setting with patients. In addition, students will have access to additional laboratory-based environments for specific teaching for microbiology and physiology, thus enabling us to contextualise complex theory into practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>\n<p>For more information, please also visit ‘<a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/how-we-teach-and-how-youll-learn-undergraduate/\"><strong>How we teach and how you’ll learn</strong></a>’.</p>"
