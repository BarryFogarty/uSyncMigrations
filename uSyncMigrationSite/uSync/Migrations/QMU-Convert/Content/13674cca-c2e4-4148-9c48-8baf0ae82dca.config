      "content": "<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Dr Maciver’s focus on investigating participation of children was established early in his career and he has developed a body of research understanding the lives of children and their participation in everyday activity.  Related child and family research has also focused on autism, mental health, parent experiences, school based interventions/assessments, post school outcomes, and employment. A hallmark of Dr Maciver’s research is collaboration between University, NHS and Education providers leading to long-standing partnerships and impacts.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><strong>Active Research Interests</strong></p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Current research aims to impact directly on children’s lives, focusing on understanding and improving outcomes for children and young people with additional support needs. Recent work has focussed on understanding participation outcomes for school age children, diagnosis and assessment guidelines for paediatric neurodevelopmental services, and analysis of waiting times for children and adults seeking neurodevelopmental assessment. Donald’s research aims to have a robust impact via the development of assessment tools and interventions. Enquiry grounded in the social model of disability is a key focus.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><strong>Research Methods</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Complex interventions development</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Qualitative research</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Evaluation</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Realist evaluation</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Meta-analysis</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Systematic review</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Realist synthesis</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Psychometrics</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Assessment development</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Cohort studies and secondary data analysis</li>\n<li class=\"x_MsoListParagraph\">Participatory action research</li>\n</ul>"
