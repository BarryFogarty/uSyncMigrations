Although its work seeks to be of wide relevance to delivery of healthcare in situations of fragility, RUHF focuses on two vital but commonly neglected areas of health provision in these contexts: mental health and psychosocial support and the treatment and prevention of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. RUHF Researchers at the QMU’s Institute for Global Health and Development (IGHD) work closely with the Unit's collaborative partners -the <a href=\"https://ghi.aub.edu.lb/\">Global Health Institute, American University of Beirut</a> (AUB), Lebanon, and the College of Medicine &amp; Allied Health Science (COMAHS), Freetown, Sierra Leone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/refugeehosts.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Refugee Hosts\"><strong>Local Community Experiences of and Responses to Conflict-Induced Displacement from Syria: Views from Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey</strong> </a></p>\n<p>This project is funded by the <a href=\"https://ahrc.ukri.org/\">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a> and <a href=\"https://esrc.ukri.org/\">Economic and Social Research Council</a>. It aims to critically examine how, why and with what effect local communities in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey are responding to mass displacement from Syria. The focus is to develop a greater understanding of the roles that religious values, beliefs and practices play both implicitly and explicitly in these responses. As one output of the project, Alastair is responsible – with Dr Anna Rowlands of Durham University – for the development of Religious Literacy Handbook for work in humanitarian and displacement-affected settings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Channels of Hope for Child Protection</strong></p>\n<p>Alastair has been supporting the evaluation of strengthening community-based World Vision programmes seeking to mobilize local faith communities in promoting child protection. After pilot work in Malawi, impact research studies have been conducted in Senegal, Uganda and Guatemala.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Recently completed projects:</p>\n<p><strong>System resilience in UNRWA health provision to Palestine refugees displaced by the Syria crisis (Health Systems Resilience)</strong></p>\n<p>This research focused on the key vulnerabilities of UNRWA health systems in the face of disruptions associated with the displacement of Palestine refugees registered in Syria (PRS). The research project was funded by Elrha’s Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme which aims to improve health outcomes by strengthening the evidence base for public health interventions in humanitarian crises. Visit <a href=\"http://www.elrha.org/work/r2hc\">www.elrha.org/work/r2hc</a>  for more information.</p>\n<p>The R2HC programme is funded equally by the Wellcome Trust and DFID, with Elrha overseeing the programme’s execution and management.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" data-udi=\"umb://document/630af4e53f3b4b67b1424208d4cc9db1\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/630af4e53f3b4b67b1424208d4cc9db1}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Health Systems Cluster\">Find out more about Health Systems Resilience</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Measuring the health &amp; wellbeing impacts of a program of psychosocial intervention for refugee youth</strong></p>\n<p>IGHD worked with Yale University in this DFID-Wellcome Trust funded work examining the impact of Mercy Corps programming with Syrian and Jordanian youth which is part of the No Lost Generation initiative. The team looked at biological and cognitive markers of stress and resilience in youth attending a broad range of activities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A Household Yeast Sensor for Cholera</strong></p>\n<p>NIH – Grant supporting development of novel cholera biosensor:</p>\n<p>This work supported colleagues at Columbia University in the development of an innovative product for cholera surveillance and explores the product’s adoption, impact and cost-effectiveness when used in humanitarian- and low-resource settings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Strengthening Evidence for the Scaling of Psychosocial First Aid (PFA) in Humanitarian Settings</strong></p>\n<p>Psychological first Aid (PFA) provides a mechanism to address mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) needs of acutely distressed people at scale in major humanitarian emergencies. This study looked at whether PFA enables stronger capacity to provide effective mental health and psychosocial support to those experiencing humanitarian crises and will not only gather evidence related to PFA in the specific context of West Africa and the Ebola crisis but also establish – through strong inter-agency engagement and regional consultation – a basis for wider, systematic, and rigorous evaluation of PFA impact.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
