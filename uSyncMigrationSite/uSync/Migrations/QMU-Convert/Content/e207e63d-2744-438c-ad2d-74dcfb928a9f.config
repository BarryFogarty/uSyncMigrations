      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Tell me a little about yourself and what attracted to you this course?</p>
<p>I’ve always been fascinated by cooking and I had a real passion for it. After junior college, I got to learn more about hospitality which would give me a chance to grow my confidence in culinary studies. After visiting the ITM campus I learned that ITM is the only college which offers an international degree through Queen Margaret University (QMU).</p>
<p>I decided to join ITM College after learning that in third year we could do research-based studies. I was nervous and excited, as this is a very different method of study from Indian studies. In India we are given the books to learn the theoretical parts to grasp the knowledge, but QMU’s programme gave me a chance to do a very different method of study through research</p>
<p>We also had an opportunity to explore different styles of leadership back in the 80s and 90s and later on we also had the opportunity to learn more about contemporary styles of leadership. This helped me to understand what different leadership approaches, and how to develop my own sense of leadership, for example, if I become a manager in a particular area I will know how best to train my staff and direct my business.</p>
<p>What do you think your leadership style is?</p>
<p>My leadership style is a bit autocratic, really, but sometimes you have to be an autocratic leader. At the same time, I have a democratic personality and I know there are limits. It’s important to strike a balance between the two. I know I can take constructive feedback from my staff as well as being an authoritative person to get the work done on time.</p>
<p>Apart from the leadership module, what did you gain the most from in this programme of study?</p>
<p>I gained a lot of things. I learned how to carry out research. With this research module, I learned the proper methods of researching and I feel this would be really helpful to people who perhaps would like to also become authors or writers. It helped me learn how to find quality, authentic information from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>What were some of the challenges you encountered?</p>
<p>I think that anything worth doing should be a challenge, otherwise you won’t take it seriously. The biggest challenge I had was in the NEC module it was a bit difficult to find the right documentations and licenses, for example, if you were to approach a bank to ask for funding. You have to do the fieldwork and know what’s going on in the market, and that proved challenging.</p>
<p>Would you like to set your own business up in the future?</p>
<p>Yes, definitely. I would love to have my own business. I am more of a culinary person so I would love to own my own outlet, but I know I need to gain more knowledge and hands-on experience before I can do that. I am good at front of house areas, and the experience I have is in food production, so I feel I can make my guests happy.</p>
<p>You could have taken the culinary course at ITM instead of the hospitality programme. Why did you choose hospitality?</p>
<p>Even though, as I said, I’m more interested in the culinary industry, if I had chosen that programme I would have been limited in my options. For example, in hospitality I learned about marketing which will be beneficial if I choose to open my own outlet in the future. I wouldn’t have had that opportunity in the culinary programme.</p>
<p>Did you undertake placements as part of your programme?</p>
<p>In second year, I did the training at xxx. It’s a two minutes’ walk from the airport. I did my training in all the four core departments – food production, food and beverage, front office, and housekeeping.</p>
<p>I will also be undertaking a placement at McDonald’s in the management trainee programme. After six months, I will be an assistant trainee manager. It will be very different and will help me understand how the industry functions, and I will be interested to learn more about the corporate world. Having experience of quick service, I think, will help me.</p>
<p>If you were going to give a recommendation to a student before they start a course like this, what would it be?</p>
<p>Join this course. You will learn something different. It will widen your thinking process, help you to develop your own personality, and give you more career opportunities. You will have numerous opportunities to take advantage of as a result of this programme.</p>
