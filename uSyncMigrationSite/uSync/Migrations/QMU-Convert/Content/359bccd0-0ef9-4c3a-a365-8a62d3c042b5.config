<p>E-bikes can be hired out at £15 per month and are for staff only. The e-bike also comes with a helmet, a lock, and lights.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" href="mailto:cycleconnections@qmu.ac.uk" target="_blank" title="Contact address for Cycle Connections">Contact Cycle Connections</a> if you are interested in either hire scheme.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Emergency maintenance kits</strong></span></p>
<p>The Security Desk has tools, lubricant, a pump, and puncture repair kits for any emergencies that may arise. A hose, located at the grounds workshop can be used freely by those who cycle. Additionally, staff and students can request access to bike cleaning materials. </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Dr. Bike sessions</strong></span></p>
<p>The University arranges a mobile mechanic to service bikes cycled in on the day. The mechanic will spend up to 15 minutes per cycle to repair minor problems on the spot. More major problems can be diagnosed and a bike "MOT" provided. These sessions are held on the last Thursday of each month beside the bike racks in University Square.

<p><span class="lead"><strong>Abandoned bicycles</strong></span></p>
<p>Cycles on campus that are deemed to be abandoned will be tagged by the active travel team. If the cycle remains for a further month it will be removed and held in storage. If again unclaimed, it will be donated to a local charity.
