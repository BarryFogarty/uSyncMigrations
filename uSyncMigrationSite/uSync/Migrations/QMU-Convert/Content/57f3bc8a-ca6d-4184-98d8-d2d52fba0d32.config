In England, only the Bank of England issues bank notes.</p>\n<p>Before you leave home, you may consider getting a bank draft in your own name in Pounds Sterling (£GBP) so that you can safely bring a large amount of money with you. Please ensure that the draft is drawn on a UK bank as this speeds up trans- actions and ensures that commission payments are dealt with locally in your own country. Once you arrive at the University, you can then open up your own bank account and deposit the bank draft. Do not bring personal cheques as many banks will not accept them.</p>\n<p>In addition, you may consider bringing some travellers cheques in Pounds Sterling as a small working reserve, enough for two weeks (about £250 - more if you are seeking accommodation outside of the University halls of residence, as you will have to pay a deposit). MasterCard and Visa credit cards are also widely accepted.</p>\n<p>Also bring with you about £250 in UK bank notes. This will cover your taxi fare and allow you money for food etc until your bank account becomes operational (nor- mally about two weeks).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Opening a Bank Account</strong></p>\n<p>ATMs will accept Visa, MasterCard, cards with the Cirrus logo and various UK bank cash cards.

If you bring a bank draft in GBP with you, you can open an account at a convenient bank. The draft should take between seven to ten days to clear.</p>\n<p>The bank will ask you to provide photo identification, confirmation that you are a student at QMU and your postal address.
