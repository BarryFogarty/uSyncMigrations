<p><span data-ccp-parastyle="Body Text 3">The Hub forms part of the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Deal, a £1.3 billion regional investment programme funded by the UK and Scottish Governments and regional partners including East Lothian Council. The City Deal’s committee approved the plan in June 2021, with the Hub being funded by £28.6 million from UK Government, £1.4 million from the Scottish Government and £10 million from East Lothian Council. </span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-parastyle="Body Text 3">The purpose of the Hub is to focus on food and drink related innovation within the context of health and wellbeing and will include serviced laboratories and office accommodation as well as facilities for events.</span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-parastyle="Body Text 3">Preparatory work has already begun on a new junction off the A1 to improve accessibility and connectivity to and from the Food and Drink Innovation Hub and wider Innovation Park.</span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-parastyle="Body Text 3">East Lothian Council Leader Norman Hampshire said: </span></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="This is great news for East Lothian as we move into the recovery phase of the pandemic as it will bring a huge boost in terms of jobs, skills and business development to the area.
