      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The Widening Participation and Outreach (WPO) team work closely with schools, colleges and communities offering tailored support and engagement activities to all.</p>
<p>Being located on one compact campus makes our university close-knit, but QMU’s community is more than that. It extends to all the people living nearby, from the local schools and colleges throughout Scotland to the wide range of organisations and partners our Widening Participation and Outreach (WPO) team work with to widen access to higher education.</p>
<p>We see our purpose as helping to create a better society through education, research and innovation, and by providing a supportive and creative learning environment. In seeking to fulfil this purpose, we are clear and realistic about our strengths, focused on strategic goals, persistent in pursuing opportunities and overcoming barriers.</p>
<p>We are a small team but a dynamic one who are happy to adapt and adjust to the needs and requirements of the students we support. Please feel free to get in touch with us as we love to hear from you.</p>]]></Value>
