      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Professor Brendan McCormack will receive the honour in October 2019 in Washington DC. The American Academy of Nursing's 2,400 fellows are nursing leaders in education, management, practice and research. Fellows represent association executives; university presidents, chancellors and deans; elected officials; state and federal political appointees; hospital chief executives and vice presidents for nursing; nurse consultants; and researchers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>As Head of the Division of Nursing and of Occupational and Arts Therapies, Professor McCormack is also the Associate Director of QMU’s Centre for Person-centred Practice Research. Working within the University’s Division of Nursing and as a Full Member and Associate Director of the Centre for Person-centred Practice Research, Professor McCormack is internationally recognised for his work in person-centred practice. His reputation as a nursing education leader has led to multiple accolades including the award of ‘International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame’ by Sigma Theta Tau International. He is also listed in the Thomson Reuters 3000 most influential researchers globally and is a Fellow of the Royal College or Nursing. </p>
<p>Professor McCormack regularly contributes to conferences and university education development all over the world, and his research success has led to long term collaborations in Ireland, Norway, Netherlands, Canada, Australia and South Africa.</p>
<p>His writing and research work focuses on person-centred practice, gerontological nursing, and practice development and he serves on a number of editorial boards, policy committees, and development groups in these areas. He has a particular focus on the use of arts and creativity in healthcare research and development.</p>
<p>Invitation to fellowship is more than recognition of one's accomplishments within the nursing profession. Academy fellows also have a responsibility to contribute their time and energies to the Academy, and to engage with other health leaders outside the Academy in transforming America's health system by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing the quality of health and nursing;</li>
<li>Promoting healthy aging and human development across the life continuum;</li>
<li>Reducing health disparities and inequalities;</li>
<li>Shaping healthy behaviours and environments;</li>
<li>Integrating mental and physical health; and</li>
<li>Strengthening the nursing and health delivery system, nationally, and internationally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Professor McCormack said: “I am truly delighted to be awarded this prestigious Fellowship.  Having my contribution to advancing nursing and healthcare recognised by the American Academy is a fantastic honour.  I am delighted to join many of my nursing heroes as Fellows of the Academy and to making a difference to future person-centred nursing and healthcare.”</p>]]></Value>
