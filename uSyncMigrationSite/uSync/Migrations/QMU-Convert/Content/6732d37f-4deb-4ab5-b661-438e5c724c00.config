      "content": "<p>The landscape of theatre and performance has evolved in recent years, and the way people consume art is changing. Digital performance is increasingly intertwined in the work that is being created and how it is shared.</p>\n<p>The programme will provide students with frameworks and experiential learning that cover both the practice and theories of performance on the Internet, as well as its currency within the industry and the development of entrepreneurial opportunities. You will learn skills in how to develop trust, intimacy, and collaboration in online ensembles, which will be very appealing to future employers. Also, the programme will place you well for self-employment, with an awareness of potential platforms, festivals, and networks to allow you to set up and monetise your own individual or collaborative practices.</p>\n<p>This programme is for all existing levels of digital experience –you do not need to be an expert in advance! A standard laptop and smartphone are the only tech requirements, as QMU will loan any additional kit as necessary.<br />Popular platforms (such as Twitch, Zoom, BBB, jitsi, Gather.town, Second Life etc) will be explored, as well as applications that have been purpose built by performance artists specifically for digital performance.</p>\n<p>All students will have access to Adobe Creative Cloud to work remotely, as well as access to our well-resourced edit suite and performance studios.</p>\n<p>This programme is designed for people who are involved in making performance as part of their professional practice, and also recent graduates who aspire to develop their work in this field. You will be able to perform in your own work, or involve others in your performance making. The programme will also develop your awareness of practice research with a potential progression to doctoral study, if desired.</p>\n<p>You will be equipped with:<br />• A critical understanding of the conceptual frameworks underpinning online / digital / internet performance practices<br />• The skills to apply this knowledge in a practical working context<br />• A critical understanding of the ethics involved in collaborating creatively with others in an online, often participatory and interactive environment<br />• An ability to critically reflect on professional development through digital performance practice</p>"

      "content": "<p>To obtain a PgCert, you will complete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Online Performance Practice (20 credits):</strong> Students will learn the fundamental principles and techniques underpinning performance making on a variety of online platforms. They will create their own practical online performance project under the guidance of staff, critically evaluating its efficacy in relation to the chosen medium.</li>\n<li><strong>Theories and Histories of Performance on the Internet (20 credits):</strong> Taking the last 30 years of historical perspective as a foundation, this module examines the conceptual justification of online performance making, using case studies and relevant examples of digital content. You will be able to appraise both histories and practical legacies, as well as the role of the Internet in building and developing new models of audience engagement and participation.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Making for Digital Audiences (20 credits):</strong> This module will allow you to understand relationships and engagement with online audiences, creating a speculative online performance project and explore how to make it financially viable in the ‘real’ world. Budgets and marketing plans will be employed to guide students towards career sustainability. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To obtain a PgDip, you will also complete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Practice Research (20 credits):</strong> This module is practice-led and driven by reflective considerations on the student’s own practice, but being exposed to case-studies, lone-projects, as well as their own experimentation. This module also receives insights from guest speakers and experts in the field who can speak of their own practical experience of engaging in online performance projects.</li>\n<li><strong>The Only Way is Ethics: Art Representation and Ethics (20 credits):</strong> The module is designed to develop the critical and practical skills needed for students to engage with the public in the delivery of cultural projects, both live and digital. It looks at examples from history as well as contemporaneous projects that engage with people at the ethical edges of participation to challenge the student to develop their own ethical frameworks.</li>\n<li>Plus a 20-credit elective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elective modules could include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Student Initiated Module (20 credits):</strong> This module provides students with an opportunity to extend and deepen their critical and integrated knowledge of a selected area of study relevant to their Master's programme through undertaking a self-directed piece of work.  Examples could include (but are not limited to) the design of an online creative event, production of a practical output such as hybrid performance work, designing a virtual theatre set, planning an online performance festival, responding to an industry competition or funding call, or an external placement. </li>\n<li><strong>Planning and Marketing Cultural Projects (20 credits):</strong> This modules looks at the practical realities of managing and marketing cultural projects and learning occurs around hypothetical projects that the students plan and market in groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Fundraising, Finance and Development (20 credits):</strong> This module will equip students with a critical understanding of the principles and practices of fundraising, development and financial management. The assessments invite students to examine financial support mechanisms (eg, completing a funding application or designing a sponsorship pack) as well as financial literacy exam.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For an MA you will also complete a Master’s Dissertation Project (60 credits), which can be practice-based if desired. Through undertaking a self-directed project that suits your strengths, interests and career aspirations, you will have the opportunity to undertake a substantial piece of work that will develop your academic rigour, professional skills, and independence in practice. This can be a 12,000 word research dissertation, or a Practical Project with associated portfolio of evidence and 5000 word reflective essay.</p>\n<p>The modules listed are correct at time of posting (October 2021) but are subject to change. In the event that modules change, QMU will seek to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that there is no detrimental impact on students.</p>\n<p> </p>"
