<p align="JUSTIFY">7*.suitable accounting policies are selected and applied consistently;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">8*.judgements and estimates are made that are reasonable and prudent;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">9*. applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">10*. financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the University will continue in operation. The University Court is satisfied that the University has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future: for this reason the going concern basis continues to be adopted in the preparation of the financial statements.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The University Court has taken reasonable steps to:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">11*. ensure that funds from the Scottish Funding Council are used only for the purposes for which they have been given and in accordance with the Financial Memorandum with the Funding Council and any other conditions which the Funding Council may from time to time prescribe;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">12*. ensure that there are appropriate financial and management controls in place to safeguard public funds and funds from other sources;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">13*. safeguard the assets of the University and prevent and detect fraud;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">14*. secure the economical, efficient and effective management of the University’s resources and expenditure.</p>]]></Value>
