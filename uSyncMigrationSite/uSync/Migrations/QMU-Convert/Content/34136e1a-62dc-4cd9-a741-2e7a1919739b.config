<p><span class="lead">Performance Dashboard</span></p>
<p>The Dashboard provides a snapshot of the most current information about:</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>when students have last accessed the module and the days since they last accessed it</li>
<li>student usage of the discussion tool.</li>
<li>It also shows you:</li>
<li>if a student has met any of the rules created in the Early-Warning System</li>
<li>which files and areas are available to the student or not through Adaptive</li>
<li>release or those that have not been released</li>
<li>the number of Content Items that have been reviewed by a student when Review Status has been used</li>
</ul>
<p>To access the Performance Dashboard, go to <strong>Control Panel/Evaluation</strong> and click on <strong>Performance Dashboard</strong>. You can sort the data into ascending and descending order by clicking on the relevant column header. Further information is available by clicking on icons and numbers displayed.</p>

<p>The Performance Dashboard shows the number of fora that a student has contributed posts to in the discussions. This is not the total number of posts by a student. If you click on the number of fora accessed, you will then see a summary of student posts, the average posting position and the date of last post.</p>
<p>[image of Dashboard]</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Clicking on the individual fora will then show the posts by the student. This may be useful when marking/moderating discussion postings.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may find that the data in the Early Warning System column is not as current as the Last Course Access / Days Since Last Course Access columns in the Performance Dashboard.

<p><span class="lead">Early-Warning System (EWS)</span></p>
<p>The Early-Warning System can be used to identify possible lack of student engagement with a Hub area. Warnings can be generated based on graded performance, late or missing course work, or lack of course access.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>A tutor needs to create a rule which will indicate that a student is not meeting that rule, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>has not accessed the Hub for a set number of days;</li>
<li>has not met a required grade in a formative quiz;</li>
<li>has not submitted an assessment by a specified date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a student has been identified by a rule, you can then decide whether to notify the student directly through email or contact the student’s PAT.</p>
<div class="page">

<p>You will then see the number of students who meet this rule, as in the example below – 16 out of 18 students</p>

In this case, you just wish to email the students only. An automatic email is then created which will be sent to the selected students. You can customise this email with your own message. The students will only see their names on the email and will not see the other students to whom the email is sent. You will receive a copy of the email which is sent to your QMU inbox.</p>

<p>There are generic reports in the Hub providing detailed information about student activity (as a collective, as a group and individually) in your module area. These reports are updated at midnight every day except the Course Enrolments which is updated four times a day.</p>
<p>To access the reports go to <strong>Control Panel/Evaluation</strong> and click on <strong>Course Reports</strong>. You will see a list of reports, some of which are described below. To run the report, click to the right of the report and select Run. In most cases, you can then filter the report by date and, often, you can select the output type: PDF, Excel, Word or HTML. It is recommended that you do not run the reports at peak times during the day (between 11am and 2pm) as it will take longer for the reports to run.</p>

<p>The report also shows on which day/s the students accessed particular areas.</p>
<p>When designing a module, it is worthwhile considering if you need to determine if students are accessing a particular area, which students are not accessing a content area and how frequently they are accessing a content area. For example, you may want to use content areas rather than folders to provide this detailed tracking information.</p>

<div class="column">

<p>This provides a quick up-to-date, overview of student numbers in your module as well as teaching assistants and instructors. For detailed information about which students have accessed go to <strong>Control Panel/Users</strong> and <strong>Groups/Users.</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Overall summary of user activity</span></p>
<p>This report details which tools have been used by students in total and on an individual basis. In the example below, only a few tools are used; hence, 0 appears by a lot of the tools as these are not used by the students and tutors.</p>

<p><span class="lead">User activity in forums</span></p>
<p>For a quick overview of individual student activity in forums, use the Performance Dashboard. The Overall Summary of User Activity also provides some information about discussion usage.</p>
<p>This report details activity about the different fora that are used, for example, which fora students are accessing (how much) and which they are not. Two charts detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of times the forums have been accessed</li>
<li>the number of times the messages have been accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the example below, you can quickly identify which fora are and are not being used.</p>

<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In the design of your module, it is worthwhile thinking about setting up different fora as you will see more information about access rather than having one forum for everything with lots of threads.
