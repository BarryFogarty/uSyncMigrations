      "content": "<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Principal thanked members for their warm welcome, and expressed his delight at being appointed to the role. In the period since his appointment, he had been impressed immensely by the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff and students with whom he had met.</p>\n<p>The Principal indicated that, for future Court meetings, he would be pleased to receive members’ suggestions concerning matters to be reported under this item, but for this first meeting, he would report briefly on a number of external and internal developments.</p>\n<p>Members were advised that the on-going uncertainty around the UK departure from the EU continued to present significant challenges to the sector. The implications of Brexit, in so far as these could be anticipated, had been added to the University’s risk register, and contingency plans were in place to mitigate against the short, medium, and longer term challenges arising. This would continue to be a matter of focus for the Audit and Risk Committee in particular.</p>\n<p>The funding climate remained extremely challenging, with there being no expectation beyond a flat cash settlement in the 2020 funding round and beyond. Universities Scotland continued to lobby the Scottish Funding Council (SFC), but the SFC was itself in a difficult position given the delay to the Spending Review. The University would remain alert to any emerging opportunities for strategic funding.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, the Principal retained a healthy balance between optimism and realism in terms of the University’s position. This would be reflected in the further development of the University Strategy, early thoughts on which were discussed with members (Paper Court (19) 33 refers).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Members were advised that it was proposed to build on the review of the University’s Strategy undertaken by the Court earlier in the year by conducting a further refresh of the document. The Principal suggested that the refresh would be an evolution of the current strategy, with the expectation that much of the current content, focus and values would remain. However, it was likely that a number of changes would be introduced to reflect the extent and pace of change internally and externally since the existing strategy was developed in 2015. This would include more explicit recognition of the need to secure the University’s financial sustainability. The number of objectives were likely to be reduced, and the plan would be supported by a delivery plan, with identified priorities for action.</p>\n<p>The refresh development process would seek views from across the University. As the document would be an evolution of the existing strategy, the review would be undertaken over a reasonably short timescale, while providing sufficient opportunity for meaningful feedback. The Executive Board would meet shortly to develop an early outline draft of the Strategy, and it was hoped that, by providing a worked-up draft, meaningful discussion would be stimulated with staff and students. The detailed project plan provided for an interactive intranet site, open forum events, as well as discussion at Senate and Court. There would be early opportunity for Court members to discuss the strategy at the December meeting of the Court, followed by the opportunity to discuss a ‘first cut’ version at the Court Away Days in February 2020, before final sign off by the Court in April.</p>\n<p>Members welcomed the development, and looked forward to engaging in the discussion at the next meeting.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Until the audit work was complete, it was not possible to confirm the final outturn position for 2018/19, but it was expected that the variances reported in the paper would result in a final underlying outturn position showing a lower deficit than the position reported in the Q3 accounts.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Members were advised in particular that the overall year-end position would be impacted by a large revaluation gain of the student accommodation residences. The accounting treatment, and the possibility of a requirement to make prior year adjustments, was currently the subject of discussion with the auditors. The outturn position would also be affected by large pension provisions as a result of the updated valuations of the USS and LGPS schemes. Final figures were awaited from the respective actuaries in relation to these adjustments.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">A full analysis of the final out-turn position, and of the main variances against budget, would be provided to the Finance and Estates Committee at its meeting on 5 November, and to the Court at its meeting on 27 November 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>8.2 Income strategy</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Members received paper Court (19) 35, which provided an analysis of the various categories of income currently generated by the University, and identified areas that could be prioritised for future income growth. The paper had been considered by the Finance and Estates Committee at its meeting on 24 September 2019, and the Committee had asked that a copy be made available to Court.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">In discussion of the paper, members were advised that international student recruitment was likely to be affected positively by the re-introduction by the UK government of the Post Study Visa scheme, with applicants from India being particularly responsive to this development. International recruitment activity was being refocused over the next few months to reflect this. It was suggested by one member that the recruitment targets were ambitious and their achievement was likely to require a ‘step-change’ in marketing and promotion. It was suggested also that it would be important to understand the ‘net contribution’ of the additional income streams.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Members were advised that the paper was a ‘work in progress’ and that the helpful observations would be accommodated in the review of the Strategy, and in particular, within the delivery plan.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>8.3  Student numbers and tuition fee income for 2019/20</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The Director of Operations &amp; Finance updated members on the position regarding the 2019-20 financial position, and in particular, a potential shortfall in student number intake and a corresponding shortfall in tuition fee income. The financial impact of that shortfall was estimated currently to be between £500k and £750k in income. A detailed analysis of factors underlying the shortfall, including any ‘lessons learned’ was being conducted, and arrangements were also in place to address some of the shortfall through recruitment to programmes in the second semester. A further update on the shortfall would be provided to Court at the November 27th meeting.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>8.4  Letter of variation with Barclays Bank plc (Court (19) 37)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">There was produced to the meeting a letter of variation (the Letter of Variation) from Barclays Bank PLC (the Bank) to the Borrower, as accepted for and on behalf of the Borrower by Irene Hynd, University Secretary and Malcolm Cutt, Director of Operations &amp; Finance (the Signatories) on 22 July 2019 (the Acceptance), setting out the amendments to a facility agreement dated 17 December 2014 (the Facility Agreement) pursuant to which the Bank has offered to Borrower the Facility (as defined in the Letter of Variation).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">It was resolved:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">1.
