      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The star of the Great British Bake Off, who was officially installed as Chancellor of Queen Margaret University (QMU) in July this year, will discuss her fascinating career as a TV personality, novelist, cookery expert and entrepreneur. She will also reveal her interest in food and diet, education and the arts, and the rights of people who are near end of life.</p>
<p> ‘In Conversation with Prue Leith’ is part of Queen Margaret University’s programme of public engagement work and the staff look forward to welcoming visitors from Edinburgh and the Lothians to this one-off event.</p>
<p>Prue Leith CBE took over the role of Chancellor from entrepreneur, Sir Tom Farmer, who served as the University’s Founding Chancellor from 2007 until 2016. Prue has become a household name in recent years due to her regular appearances on TV. Up until 2016, she spent 11 years as a judge on BBC 2’s cooking contest programme ‘Great British Menu’. She now stars on prime time TV alongside Paul Hollywood, as the new judge on the popular amateur cooking show ‘The Great British Bake Off’.</p>
<p>The TV personality has an impressive track record as an entrepreneur, having successfully built a catering business from scratch in the 1960s which grew to become Leith’s Good Food, the party and event caterer. In 1969, she opened Leith’s, her famous Michelin starred restaurant, and, in 1975, founded Leith’s School of Food and Wine which trains professional chefs and amateur cooks. Today, Leith’s has catering contracts at the most prestigious venues, including at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC)</p>
<p>In more recent years, Prue has mainly worked as a novelist and journalist.  She has just finished her eighth novel and an updated edition of her autobiography ‘Relish: My Life on a Plate’ has just been published. She contributes regularly to national newspapers and magazines, such as the Spectator, writing on various topics.</p>
<p>Dr Richard Butt, Deputy Principal at QMU, said: “We are delighted that Prue has agreed to give us an insight into her life and we are pleased to be able to welcome the community to our ‘In Conversation’ event. Prue has made a significant contribution to the food and hospitality landscape of the UK – helping to identify and nurture young culinary talent and promote good food health for all. Aside from her success as a culinary expert, she has also lent her voice to campaigns which highlight issues of care for older people and the rights of people who are dying.”</p>
<p>Prue will be interviewed by Stan Blackley, who is Programme Leader and Lecturer on QMU’s MSc in Gastronomy. QMU is the first and only University in the UK to offer a Masters course in Gastronomy, a course that takes a multi-disciplinary look at how food features in and shapes our lives and the world around us.</p>
<p>‘In Conversation with Prue Leith CBE’ will take place on Wednesday 29<sup>th</sup> November at 6pm (doors open 5.30pm) in the Halle Lecture Theatre at Queen Margaret University. It is anticipated that places for this event will be in high demand so booking is essential. Please email <a href="mailto:PublicLectures@qmu.ac.uk">PublicLectures@qmu.ac.uk</a> to book a place or complete the booking form at <a href="mailto:https://www.qmu.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/in-conversation-with-prue-leith-cbe/">https://www.qmu.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/in-conversation-with-prue-leith-cbe/</a></p>
<p>Event visitors are invited to join Prue and QMU guests for tea and coffee at a short reception following the talk.</p>]]></Value>
