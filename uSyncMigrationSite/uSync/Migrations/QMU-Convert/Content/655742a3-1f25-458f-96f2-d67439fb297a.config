<p><strong>To students:</strong></p>
<p>Dear students</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Protecting yourself and others from COVID this new academic year </strong></span></p>
<p>As you will know from previous communications,<strong> we anticipate the delivery of our learning and teaching this year to be much as it was prior to the pandemic, while retaining some of the recent technological developments where those developments enhance the student </strong><strong>experience</strong><strong> (</strong><a href="/coronavirus/applicants/"><strong>more details available on our website</strong></a><strong>). </strong>You will be pleased to know that Students’ Union events and activities will run as normal too, without COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>Although all COVID rules and restrictions have been lifted in Scotland, the virus has not gone away. </p>
<p>Please use 'COVID sense' to help protect yourself and others, and to reduce pressure on health services. This means that you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nhsinform.scot/covid-19-vaccine/"><strong>Get your vaccine </strong></a>when offered to ensure you are fully protected. NHS Inform has a <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/vaccinesforstudents">website specifically for students with information on how to get vaccinated</a> against COVID and other diseases.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19"><strong>Stay at home </strong></a><strong>if you’re unwell</strong> with symptoms or have a fever (see our <a href="/coronavirus/faqs/accommodation/"><strong>Accommodation coronavirus FAQs</strong></a><strong> </strong>for advice if you live on campus).  You no longer have to report COVID illness to the University, but you do still need to tell us via the <a href="/study-here/learning-facilities/it-services/qmu-portal/">Student Portal</a> if any illness means that you will be absent from classes.</li>
<li><strong>Open windows</strong> when socialising indoors.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-safe-and-protecting-others/pages/face-coverings/">Where appropriate, wear a face covering </a>in indoor public places and on public transport. (<strong>While you are not required to wear a face covering on campus, we would support those who choose to do so.)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep your hands clean </strong>by washing them regularly throughout the day and using the hand gel at sanitiser stations on campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no requirement this year to ‘test before travel’ when you move into University accommodation (but do stay home if you’re unwell with symptoms).</p>
<p><strong>For </strong><a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice"><strong>advice on symptoms and what to do if you think you have coronavirus, visit NHS Inform</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We continue to keep our <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus website</a> up to date with University-specific COVID advice, including <a href="/coronavirus/faqs/">FAQs</a>. Our COVID inbox remains open for any COVID-related questions not covered on our website (<a href="mailto:CovidHelp@qmu.ac.uk">CovidHelp@qmu.ac.uk</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you for your support in following COVID sense.</p>
<p>Wishing you a happy and fulfilling academic year.</p>

<p><strong>To staff:</strong></p>
<p>Dear colleagues</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Protecting yourself and others from COVID this new academic year </strong></span></p>
<p>With the new academic year about to begin, I am writing to update you on the University’s advice on COVID. A similar message is being issued to students, which you can find on the <a href="/coronavirus/updates/">updates for students and staff</a> section of our coronavirus website.</p>
<p>As you will know from previous communications,<strong> we anticipate the delivery of our learning and teaching this academic year to be much as it was prior to the pandemic, while retaining some of the recent technological developments where those developments enhance the student experience </strong>(<a href="/coronavirus/applicants/">more details available on our website</a>). Students’ Union events and activities will run as normal, without COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>Although all COVID rules and restrictions have been lifted in Scotland, the virus has not gone away, as we all know. </p>
<p>Please continue to use 'COVID sense' to help protect yourself and others, and to reduce pressure on health services. This means that you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nhsinform.scot/covid-19-vaccine/"><strong>Get your vaccine </strong></a>when offered to ensure you are fully protected. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19"><strong>Stay at home </strong></a><strong>if you’re unwell</strong>with symptoms or have a fever.  You no longer have to report to Security and HR if you test positive for COVID, but you do, of course, still need to report sickness absence as per the sickness absence management policy and procedure.</li>
<li><strong>Open windows</strong> when socialising indoors.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-safe-and-protecting-others/pages/face-coverings/">Where appropriate, wear a face covering </a>in indoor public places and on public transport.

      "content": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Changes to government guidance regarding face coverings </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From next Monday, 18 April, the legal requirement to wear a face covering on public transport, in shops and in other indoor settings will be removed in Scotland. Please note, however, that <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-universities-colleges-and-community-learning-and-development-providers/pages/overview/\">the Scottish Government has published guidance for universities, colleges and community learning</a>, which suggests that face coverings continue to be encouraged, even when not mandatory, in settings where the risk of transmission might be considered higher. In line with this advice, we ask those who are able to do so to continue to wear a face covering when moving around our campus buildings and in busy spaces.  </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Changes to testing arrangements and to reporting a positive test result to the University </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, from Monday 18 April, the Scottish Government guidance on Covid testing will change, which means that people are no longer being asked to test twice weekly. After this date, only those who have symptoms, are a close contact of someone with Covid, or are visiting a hospital or care home will be asked to undertake a test. The guidance on this can be found <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/test-protect-transition-plan/pages/1/\">on the Scottish Government's website</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reflect this change, the LFD Collect scheme which has operated in universities has now stopped, and LFD test kits will no longer be available on campus for routine testing from Monday, 18 April.  </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students and staff are no longer required to report a positive COVID test result to Campus Operations from Monday, 18 April, nor to inform the School Office and Accommodation Office (students) nor the Head of HR (staff).  </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing will continue for those with symptoms and will be available up to the end of April, with PCR tests available to anyone with symptoms. PCR tests will be accessible at test sites and by post until the end of April. Positive cases will continue to be advised to isolate (though can continue to shorten their isolation period if negative on lateral flow tests on day 6 and day 7). Those who test positive during this period should continue to stay at home for the duration of the self-isolation period. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>QMU Business Continuity Group meetings to be replaced by COVID Response Group </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the beginning of the pandemic, representatives from across the University and the Students' Union have attended regular Business Continuity Group meetings to analyse the latest government guidance and put in place measures to keep our community safe. In light of the recent changes to COVID restrictions in place in Scotland, we have decided to replace that group with a COVID Response Group, which will meet every two months. Please be assured that we will continue to be vigilant, to promote positive behaviours and to monitor the position closely, responding as required to any future emerging situation to ensure the safety of all QMU students and staff. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Protecting yourself and others from COVID </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In line with our commitment to promoting positive behaviours, we ask that our university community continues to act in accordance with the Scottish Government’s COVID Sense guidance, which suggests that, as members of the general public, we: </p>\n<ol style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li>Open windows when socialising indoors. </li>\n<li>Wear a face covering in indoor public places or on public transport (even though this is no longer a legal requirement). </li>\n<li>Wash our hands to protect ourselves and others. </li>\n<li>Get the vaccine when offered. </li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if you are feeling unwell, <strong>please stay at home. </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are on the highest risk list, you can get further support from Student Services or the Human Resources and Health and Safety Team. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice\">advice on symptoms and what to do if you think you have coronavirus, visit NHS Inform</a>. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malcolm G Cutt </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director of Finance &amp; Corporate Strategic Development </p>"

The main guidance is that the NHS will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ask you for any payment to receive a copy of your vaccination status;</li>\n<li>ask you for bank details;</li>\n<li>ask you to prove your identity by sending copies of personal documents such as passports;</li>\n<li>tell you that you only have a limited time in which to apply to receive your status.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for your continued support.</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Finance and Corporate Strategic Development</p>"

This reflects the advice from the First Minister in her <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-update-first-ministers-statement-11-january-2022/\" title=\"Scottish Government - First Minister Statement 11th Jan\">statement to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday</a>.</p>\n<p>This means that, although the hybrid working model for the start of this semester will be a lot like that for last semester, for the short term staff should continue to consider working from home if their presence on campus is not necessary.  Meetings should generally be held online at this time.</p>\n<p>We still expect those members of staff whose role involves face-to-face interaction with students, and those members of staff whose presence on campus is required to enable that interaction, to be present on campus when that presence is required. This applies to all members of academic staff involved in in-person teaching. It also applies to members of staff in professional services areas who provide a face-to-face service to students, and to those staff whose role is such that their presence on campus is required for them to perform it. Similarly, there are professional services staff who need to provide in-person support to other staff.  </p>\n<p>By way of contrast, those members of staff whose role does not involve any direct face-to-face contact with students, and who do not provide essential in-person services for colleagues, should continue to work from home in the short-term if they are able to carry out their duties remotely.</p>\n<p>If you are not sure whether your presence is required on campus, please ask your Head of Division or Service for advice. In turn, and if required, they can seek advice from their SLT member as appropriate.</p>\n<p>We recognise that some staff may wish to continue working on campus simply for reasons of wellbeing, and that is allowed.</p>\n<p>We hope that we can soon return to the interim model of hybrid working that was operational for most of the last semester.

This includes Hogmanay and New Year.  As you will remember, in the run up to Christmas we have been asked to minimise socialising, limiting any gathering to three households, and to test before meeting up with others. </p>\n<p><strong>Restrictions on size of live public events and on sport: </strong>The First Minister also announced the government’s intention to place limits on the size of live public events from 26 December for a period of three weeks, including spectator sports and Hogmanay events.  In addition, she advised that non-professional indoor contact sports for adults should not take place during the three week period from 26 December. </p>\n<h2><span class=\"lead\">Reminder to take important papers home</span></h2>\n<p>If you are a student changing household over Christmas, we suggest that take with you any important papers and other possessions that you think you might need early next year, in light of the current uncertainties arising from the Omicron COVID variant.

This includes Hogmanay and New Year.  As you will remember, in the run up to Christmas we have been asked to minimise socialising, limiting any gathering to three households, and to test before meeting up with others. </p>\n<p><strong>Restrictions on size of live public events and on sport: </strong>The First Minister also announced the government’s intention to place limits on the size of live public events from 26 December for a period of three weeks, including spectator sports and Hogmanay events.  In addition, she advised that non-professional indoor contact sports for adults should not take place during the three week period from 26 December. </p>\n<h2><span class=\"lead\">Reminder to take important papers home</span></h2>\n<p>For students changing household over Christmas, we have suggested that they take with them any important papers and other possessions that they think they might need early next year, in light of the current uncertainties arising from the Omicron COVID variant.

      "content": "<p>For students and staff:</p>\n<p>This is a brief coronavirus update, but it features some important information on the latest guidance on regular testing, and on testing before travel between semester one and two.</p>\n<h2>Latest advice from government on regular testing, and testing when planning to meet people socially</h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/official-report/what-was-said-in-parliament/meeting-of-parliament-23-11-2021?meeting=13424&amp;iob=121848#orscontributions_M1848E394P731C2358895\">statement</a> to the Scottish Parliament on COVID this week, the First Minister emphasised the importance of us all continuing to test ourselves regularly.  She also asked that we all take a lateral flow (LFD) test on any occasion when we are socialising, whether that is going out for drinks or dinner, visiting someone at home or even going shopping somewhere that might be crowded.</p>\n<p>You can collect LFD test kits on campus from the Main Reception, the Accommodation Reception, and the Students’ Union. Kits are also available free of charge <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-get-a-test-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms\">from pharmacies, community testing centres or online.</a></p>\n<p>The First Minister also announced that people attending venues covered by Scotland's COVID certification scheme are to be given the <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/negative-test-becomes-part-of-certification-scheme/\">option of providing a recent negative lateral flow test for the virus, as an alternative to proof of vaccination</a>.  As you will perhaps know, our Students’ Union has been working very hard to ensure that government knows the difficulties that the vaccine certification scheme has posed for those students who have received a vaccine not recognised by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) or who have had other issues accessing their vaccine certification. We hope that this amendment to the scheme will make things much easier for students in this situation.</p>\n<h2>‘Test Before Travel’ advice</h2>\n<p>The Scottish Government has asked students planning to travel home at Christmas to follow the latest ‘Test Before Travel’ advice for domestic travel at the end of Semester One and for the return for Semester Two. This means taking an LFD test three days before travel and on the day of travel. It also means taking an LFD test three days before travel and on the day of travel before returning to term-time accommodation.</p>\n<p>The Scottish Government has also just announced a decision for <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/self-isolation-for-all-travellers-returning-from-six-african-countries/\">travellers returning from six African countries</a> to protect public health in Scotland in light of an emerging variant.</p>\n<h2>Thinking ahead to semester two</h2>\n<p>We have updated our statement on our approach to teaching and learning this year very slightly, to reflect the position for semester two.  You can find this updated statement on our <a href=\"/coronavirus/applicants/campus-life/\">coronavirus website</a>.  In short, we do not anticipate significant changes to our approach in semester 1, and the semester 2 timetable has been published.</p>\n<p>Wishing you a good weekend.</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Finance and Corporate Strategic Development</p>"

We are following NHS/Scottish Government rules on self isolation, found on the <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/self-help-guides/self-help-guide-when-and-how-long-to-self-isolate-due-to-coronavirus\">NHS Inform website</a>.  Whatever your situation, you can check whether you need to self isolate on the NHS Inform website. If you don’t need to self isolate according to NHS Inform, you can come to work  As things stand, the rules state you don’t need to self isolate if a member of your household tests positive, provided (1) you have been double vaccinated for 14 days, and (2) you don’t have symptoms and (3) you have received a negative PCR test. But as the rules are complex and subject to change, we will continue to direct you to the NHS Inform website for advice on whether or not to self isolate in any given situation. In short, if NHS Inform advises you that don’t need to self isolate, you can come to work.</li>\n<li><strong>If you have symptoms of coronavirus Isolate, Test and Tell following</strong> the guidance in our FAQs for<a href=\"/coronavirus/faqs/staff/\"> staff</a> and for <a href=\"/coronavirus/faqs/students/\">students</a>.

The IMG includes senior professional services staff from Student Services, the School Office, Security, the residences, Human Resources and Health &amp; Safety, as well as Student Union (SU) representatives.  IMG reports in to BCG which includes the deans and senior staff across the University, as well as Trade Union and SU representatives.  We have detailed COVID incident plans, created with input from NHS Lothian and other partners, and our Incident Planning Group is meeting in the next few days to run through all our plans again. Our provision of on-campus COVID testing and vaccination facilities will also help reduce the risk of large numbers of students and staff needing to self-isolate and/or being required to self-isolate for the full quarantine period. </p>\n<p>Wishing you all the very best for the new semester.</p>\n<p>Professor Richard Butt</p>\n<p>Deputy Principal</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Updated Policy on Face Coverings</p>\n<p>We are updating our policy on face coverings with immediate effect, based on the latest advice from the Scottish Government.  </p>\n<p>In line with Scottish Government guidance, anyone on campus will be required to use face coverings when inside the buildings.

The government have outlined a number of<a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-use-of-face-coverings/\"> 'reasonable' reasons for not wearing a face covering</a>.  If you need advice on exemptions (eg if you think you cannot deliver a particular specialist class with students wearing face coverings) please email Health and Safety (<a href=\"mailto:hs-staff@qmu.ac.uk\">hs-staff@qmu.ac.uk</a>).</p>\n<p>The requirement to wear a face coverings on campus will be reviewed mid-semester and will take account of government guidance prevailing at that time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=241\" alt=\"Image of advice from QMU regarding Coronavirus\" width=\"500\" height=\"241\" data-udi=\"umb://media/8985ebcba2fa4240beb09f632cd6b268\" /></p>"

We are providing these services as part of our ongoing commitment to reducing the risk of COVID infection amongst our University community and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Drop-in COVID vaccination clinic on campus for students and staff </strong></p>\n<p>We are hosting a drop-in COVID vaccination centre on campus from Monday, 13 September to Friday, 24 September. The clinic will be based at a cabin outside 1875 (our Food Court), and will be open Monday to Friday between 11.00 am and 6.00 pm daily. Access to the clinic for students and staff will be in 1875.</p>\n<p>The drop-in service is open to all students, including international students, and to all staff. You can come for your first or second jab, provided there has been an eight-week gap between your vaccination.  As it is a drop-in clinic, you will not need to register or to book an appointment in advance in order to get your vaccine – you just turn up during the advertised hours and days on which the clinic is open.  You don’t need to be registered with a GP, to bring a letter or any ID, to be vaccinated.</p>\n<p>The Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being used but please note that there is no choice of vaccine. NHS Lothian, who are running the clinic, are following national guidance from the JCVI. For more information, see NHS Lothian’s <a href=\"https://www.nhslothian.scot/Coronavirus/Vaccine/Pages/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx\">FAQs.</a></p>\n<p>If you are a student and able to get vaccinated before the start of the semester, we would still urge you to do so. There are drop-in vaccine clinics operating across Scotland currently, details of which can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/vaccinedropinclinics\">NHS Inform website</a>.  These are open to everyone, regardless of where they live. There is information on vaccines for international students on the <a href=\"https://www.studentinformation.gov.scot/coronavirus/international-students\">Student Information Scotland website</a>, and international students can find further guidance at our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2903c860f28b4ce5a34a763573cd0783}\" title=\"FAQs\">coronavirus FAQs</a> webpage. </p>\n<p>By getting the vaccine as soon as you can, you will help to reduce the risk of COVID and keep Scotland on track.</p>\n<p><strong>LFD Collect: a service enabling you to test for COVID twice weekly at home </strong></p>\n<p>Under arrangements agreed for Scottish universities, students and staff without COVID symptoms will be able to collect lateral flow devices (LFDs) on campus for routine twice weekly testing at home.  The service will be available from Monday, 13 September to Thursday, 30 September. </p>\n<p>It is quick and easy to do a self-administered lateral flow test, and the kits offered as part of this service require only a nasal swab ie a throat swab is not required.  Full instructions are provided in each kit.</p>\n<p>Testing is voluntary, but is an important part of the Scottish Government’s approach to containing the COVID virus. Around 1 in 3 people with coronavirus do not show symptoms, so can spread the virus to others without knowing. Regular testing helps to find positive cases in people who have no symptoms, but who are still infectious. If people who test positive self-isolate, we can break chain of transmission and help limit the spread of coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The LFD kit collection point will be just inside the main entrance to the University, at the desk opposite the main reception. You will be able to collect a box containing seven tests, which will allow you to test yourself twice a week over the three week period of the service.  The collection point will be open between 11.00 am and 4.00 pm on advertised dates (specific dates to be confirmed). Students living in on-campus accommodation are being provided with test kits in their rooms, and so will not need to visit the collection point for their kits.</p>\n<p>It is important that you report each test result online to NHS Test and Trace, whether positive, negative or void. Reporting takes only a minute or two, and Instructions for doing this come with the testing kits. Reporting results helps the NHS monitor the spread of the virus, combat the virus and save lives.  Please see the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-privacy-information\">NHS Track and Trace Privacy Notice Summary</a> to find out how they use your personal data.</p>\n<p>It is important that all students and staff testing themselves twice-weekly at home arrange to self-isolate immediately in the event of a positive test, and order a confirmatory PCR test.  If you do register a positive result, please let us know, as per the instructions in our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/dfe7ffd43654452ba70403e5181a48db}\" title=\"Staff\">staff</a> and <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2d74bbbb94e34467ab39bb1f82a83b2e}\" title=\"Students\">student</a> coronavirus FAQs, so that we can provide pastoral support and further advice. Even if the test result is negative, you should continue to test yourself twice weekly.</p>\n<p>Please remember too that you do not need to travel to campus to obtain lateral flow devices.  Each of us can <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-get-a-test-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms\">obtain free LFD testing kits for use at home through pharmacies, community testing sites and online</a>.  </p>\n<p>As set out above, the LFD Collect service will be available to students returning to campus, and to student accommodation.  However, all students are strongly encouraged to take a test 48 hours before the date of travel, to help avoid spreading of the virus. Students living in Scotland or in Wales who are moving to take up term time accommodation should access free PCR testing <em>before</em> leaving their current address. English and Northern Irish domiciled students should access ‘LFD at home’ testing.  Further information can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.studentinformation.gov.scot/coronavirus/new-term\">Student Information Scotland website</a> (Test and Protect section of page).</p>\n<p>We do hope that you will participate in twice-weekly testing, whether you obtain test kits on campus or elsewhere, and that you act to get vaccinated as soon as possible, if you are not vaccinated currently.  Your actions will help to keep us all safe. Thank you for your support.</p>\n<p>All the information above is also found on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/ce8c5f4b067647529811fd507b9beadb}\" title=\"Test\">Testing and Vaccination</a> webpage which will be updated as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Irene Hynd</p>\n<p>University Secretary</p>"

Thank you.</p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">Operating on campus at ‘Beyond Level 0’ </p>\n<p>As you will know, nationally we are at what the Scottish Government term ‘Beyond Level 0’. We are planning for the start of next semester based on this status, as described on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/5a7707786d114459a3af3db923be1e56}\" title=\"Coronavirus beyond level 0: how the University works\">coronavirus website.</a>  Our Senior Leadership Team continues to liaise directly with government, and in the event that any COVID restrictions were to be changed nationally or locally, we would be able to respond proportionately and speedily.</p>\n<p>We are currently updating campus signage, website and intranet information, room layouts etc to reflect Beyond Level 0. If you are on campus during this transitional phase, you may, for example, still come across signage relating to the situation before we moved into Beyond Level 0.  We plan to have everything up to date for the start of the semester.</p>\n<p>Within teams across the University, discussions continue on preparation for working at Beyond Level 0. As you know, we are treating this as a transitional semester, during which we will be trialling approaches to service delivery and working patterns, including hybrid working, that accommodate the business needs of the University and its stakeholders.  </p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">Risk assessments  </p>\n<p>In these discussions, one common question that has arisen is in relation to ventilation in areas without windows. The campus buildings have modern ventilation systems that have been designed to meet building standards and the fresh air provision is through natural ventilation (i.e. windows), mechanical ventilation or a combination of both. The mechanical ventilation is primarily supplied through floor grilles but can also be via high-level grilles. In line with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recommendations, our ventilation systems are set to be fully operational from two hours before occupation and continue two hours post occupation to purge the buildings. The Estates team will continue to monitor the performance of the system via the Building Management System and will audit the air quality in spaces by deploying portable CO2 monitors, as appropriate.  </p>\n<p>We know there have been some questions about windows which cannot be opened (for example, because of blinds), and which windows should be opened. We are addressing these points and, as appropriate, will provide guidance in signage in the spaces concerned.  Colleagues have also asked if doors into teaching spaces should be left open.  Doors should be left shut to avoid unbalancing our ventilation systems.  Indeed fire doors must always be left closed and wedging them open breaches safety regulations. </p>\n<p>You can find the latest version of our University-Wide Risk Assessment (URA) on our <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/SitePages/Risk%20Assessments.aspx\">COVID intranet site</a>. This risk assessment is in line with HSE guidance and has been prepared in consultation with our trade unions, and is designed to ensure that we provide a safe working environment. </p>\n<p>Things we ask you to do to keep us all safe: new video launched </p>\n<p>We have launched a short video setting out the things that we are asking students to do to help keep us all safe. You can find our ‘Keeping You Safe’ video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsB6AmckyZI&amp;t=3s\">YouTube</a> and on the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/e3a1cc188042429781c78bab7ff95416}\" title=\"Campus Life\">Campus Life and Health and Safety page</a> on our COVID website.</p>\n<p>Our updated “Working Safely on Campus” e-learning module for staff is near completion, and will be in line with the guidance we are giving students. We also plan updated Open Plan Working Etiquette Guidance. In the meantime, we would ask staff to keep their desks and surrounding areas as clear as possible, to enable easy surface cleaning and to help create a healthy and pleasant working environment for us all.</p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">Additional social space on campus </p>\n<p>For the first few weeks of semester, we will have a marquee on campus (‘The Tent’) to provide additional social and event space, helping to avoid congestion, and our Students’ Union have announced their <a href=\"https://www.qmusu.org.uk/top-menu/events/welcome-to-qmu-2021\">Welcome to QMU 2021 Guide</a>. </p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">Importance of regular COVID testing and of testing before travel  </p>\n<p>Within our Keeping You Safe video we refer to the importance of us all testing ourselves regularly and of students travelling to term-time accommodation taking a COVID test before they travel.  We are working with government to provide Lateral Flow Device (LFD) asymptomatic testing kits for student and staff collection on campus from the start of the semester, to allow twice weekly testing at home.

This guidance takes account of the fact that, with effect from the start of semester one in mid-September, the overwhelming majority of students will be back on campus, and that the working pattern for most staff will therefore more closely resemble the position which pertained pre-COVID. It includes advice on how managers should engage with their team members and obtain their feedback, using an informal, consultative approach. As we are conscious that some line managers will be on holiday right now, the HR team are keeping an eye on progress, to help ensure that, as far as possible, all staff members have an opportunity to participate in discussions.</li>\n<li>I am sure that many of you are taking advantage of the fact that, nationally, we are at Beyond Level 0. We are planning for the start of next semester based on this status, as described on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/b673e3c08a21451691ec92f364641f89}\" title=\"Coronavirus\">coronavirus website</a>. <strong>As you will appreciate, it will take time to get all campus signage, website and intranet information, room layouts, etc, configured for Beyond Level 0. This means that we are in a transitional phase during which you may, for example, still come across signage relating to the situation before we moved into Beyond Level 0.</strong>  Please be assured that everything will be up to date in advance of the start of induction week on 13 September. As part of this work, in due course you will be issued with an updated “Working Safely on Campus” e-learning module and updated Open Plan Working Etiquette Guidance.</li>\n<li><strong>Our University Wide </strong>and<strong> Learning and Teaching</strong> <strong>risk assessments </strong>have been<strong> updated </strong>to take account of the move to Beyond Level 0.

From now, face coverings only require to be worn when circulating across indoor campus spaces, except by those who are legally exempt for medical reasons.  You do not need to wear a face covering when seated, for example in the Learning Resource Centre, atrium, staff open plan offices, teaching and learning spaces etc, although you may of course continue to choose to do so.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope that this update is helpful. Unless there is further news to report, our next COVID update will not be until after the end of August.  In the meantime, I hope we all enjoy some sunny weather over the remainder of the summer.</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>"

We will maintain the capacity to switch to a more blended mode of delivery (combination of on campus and online learning activity) if Scottish Government guidelines require it. </p>\n<p>Campus life</p>\n<p>We will continue to offer indoor and outdoor food and alcohol sales in Maggie’s and anticipate using a licenced marquee during peak periods of demand.  Starbucks and the 1875 food court will be open subject to demand. You will be encouraged to use the app to order food to avoid queues.  </p>\n<p>We expect that all sports will be permitted, but subject to some continuing mitigating actions.  We expect too that social activities will be possible for student societies, the Students’ Union, and ResLife, subject to events sector guidance.</p>\n<p>Our route map</p>\n<p>You can find all the above information in our route map for the return to campus, which you can now find on the coronavirus section of our website. Our route map mirrors the Scottish Government’s coronavirus protection levels and draws on current advice and guidance issued by the Scottish Government.</p>\n<p>For semester one of 2021/22, it is currently anticipated that we will be operating under the “beyond level zero” protection level. It should be noted that, in this level, there will no longer be a requirement for physical distancing. However, several other mitigations will remain in place, including continued use of face coverings, enhanced hygiene / cleaning in high volume traffic areas, attendance recording for outbreak management purposes, and enhanced ventilation with routine and regular monitoring. There will no longer be one-way systems on campus, except at the entry and exit points. Two-way circulation will be managed through signage advising you to keep to the left.</p>\n<p>Vaccinations and Testing</p>\n<p>The roll-out of the national vaccination programme continues, with all adults expected to have had their first dose by 18 July, and to have had their second dose by 12 September.</p>\n<p>Vaccinations are key to our way out of the pandemic, and while an individual choice, it is important that you take up the vaccine when invited to do so, as you can get seriously ill with coronavirus at any age. Although having the vaccine does not eliminate the risk of coronavirus, if you and your loved ones have it, it will reduce the impact of the virus and help us to get back to the things we’ve all missed.  You can find <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/covid-19-vaccine\">further information at NHS inform</a></p>\n<p>It is expected that, for the start of next academic session, the Scottish Government will support universities in providing Lateral Flow Device (LFD) asymptomatic testing kits for student and staff collection on campus. This would bring universities in line with the offer in other education settings.  Alongside this, the government is encouraging students, and indeed all of us without Covid symptoms to take advantage of LFD testing through a variety of routes. You can <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-get-a-test-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms\">order lateral flow tests online or collect them from a test site, for fast twice weekly testing at home</a>.</p>\n<p><br />Advice for international students – arrival, quarantine, visa, and vaccination</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage as many students as possible to return to campus in time for the start of the academic term in September where it is possible to do so. For those international students unable to make it here to Edinburgh for the start of semester due to travel restrictions or delays in the issuing of visas, we will do all we can to support you until you are able to return to the campus.  For those who can return, our expectation is that you do so. Your time at university will be significantly enhanced by an on-campus experience and many of our programmes have compulsory practical requirements that we cannot deliver remotely.</p>\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/998895/Student_Guidance-_Covid-19_response_01072021_FINAL.pdf\">current guidance issued by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI),</a> new and returning international students who are initially <strong>unable</strong> to travel to the UK are permitted to undertake their course of study via distance learning but must travel to commence their study in person as soon as they are able and no later than 6<sup>th</sup> April 2022. Students will still need to demonstrate that they are fully engaging in their programme of study.  Students in this position should email <a href=\"mailto:registry@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>registry@qmu.ac.uk </strong></a>as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>International students who hold a Tier 4/ Student Visa who are already in the UK will <strong>not</strong> be able to study via distance learning from Semester 1 under that guidance. They can continue existing courses or commence new courses of study by blended learning. Blended learning is currently permitted by UKVI until 6<sup>th</sup> April 2022. This means that students will be expected to attend all sessions in person on campus that are detailed by your chosen course of study at QMU.</p>\n<p>We also recommend visiting the <a href=\"https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/\">UK Council for International Student Affairs</a> website as a source of external advice.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Scottish Government recently announced that the vaccination programme in Scotland has been <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/expanding-the-national-vaccination-programme/\">expanded to include all international students</a>. You will find FAQs on this topic on the <a href=\"https://www.studentinformation.gov.scot/coronavirus/international-students\"><strong>Student Information Scotland</strong></a> website and the QMU FAQs for <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/4da50204dcaa4c608ee3d0a49f0438c5}\" title=\"International\">International Students</a> which will be regularly updated. </p>\n<p>Discussions are continuing with the Scottish Government on quarantine arrangements for overseas students, with the current understanding being that students from amber list countries observe quarantine in their home – whether that be University halls, purpose-built student accommodation, or private accommodation. </p>\n<p>How we will keep you updated</p>\n<p>Although we plan to pause our regular coronavirus email updates until the latter half of August, we will communicate any significant updates and guidance by email, social media, and the website, as necessary. Please remember that the coronavirus section on the University website will normally be the best place for you to find up-to-date information on our plans.</p>\n<p>We hope you are looking forward to the next academic year with optimism and excitement.  While things will still be ‘different’, we are confident that student life will be easier than it has been this last year. In the meantime, we wish you a happy and fulfilling summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Professor Richard Butt, Deputy Principal                                              <br /></strong><strong>Malcolm G Cutt, Director of Operations &amp; Finance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-------------</strong></p>\n<p>Dear colleagues</p>\n<p>Update on staff return to campus “route map”</p>\n<p>Following the First Minister’s announcement to parliament last week, we are now able to provide an update on the University’s route map for staff return to campus in semester one. The <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/513ad49bbf3740ce9584ff3b5ab52981}\" title=\"Qm Route Map Simple Version 2021 V09 220721\" data-udi=\"umb://media/2f9c57c2b8cb4da48fa42e3ce6c34ba4\">route map</a>, which you can find on the coronavirus section of our website, mirrors the Scottish Government’s coronavirus protection levels and draws on current advice and guidance issued by the Scottish Government. It has been informed by the planning principles and assumptions agreed by Senate, and has also been informed by the University Risk Assessment, which may be viewed <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/SitePages/Risk%20Assessments.aspx\">on our COVID intranet site</a>.</p>\n<p>The route map will be hosted on the University website and will make clear what protection level is applicable to the University campus at any given time. It will also be adjusted as further iterations of government guidance are issued and updated. For semester one of 2021/22, it is currently anticipated that we will be operating under the “beyond level zero” protection level, and the route map identifies the implications arising from this level on the various University operations and activities</p>\n<p>In many respects, the “beyond level zero” level implies a return to operational activities comparable with those that existed pre-COVID, although in each case subject to ongoing, albeit reduced, levels of mitigation. All operations and activities will continue to be supported by relevant risk assessments, which will ensure that it is safe for staff to return to campus.  We see semester one, and potentially the whole of the 2021/22 academic year, as a period of transition, before we return to a more stable way of operating.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for staff working arrangements in semester one?</p>\n<p>The University route map sets out which activities will be permitted on campus from September. In line with the Scottish Government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scotlands-strategic-framework-update-june-2021/\">Strategic Framework update</a>, issued in June, we will continue to support a greater degree of working from home than pre-COVID during this transitional period where that is possible and appropriate. How this applies to specific staff teams will depend on the nature of the service they offer and where they can most effectively deliver that service, mindful that students will be back on campus for most of their learning and teaching activities. Your manager will be in touch to discuss those working arrangements with you if they have not already done so.  Plans for learning and teaching remain as set out on the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/84daaed5f3d04cd09566859f91fb8d90}\" title=\"Applicants\">coronavirus section of the website</a>, and recent Government announcements support our agreed approach to the timetable and learning and teaching delivery in the coming semester.</p>\n<p>Other aspects of campus life</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>We will continue to offer indoor and outdoor food and alcohol sales in Maggie’s and anticipate using a licenced marquee during peak periods of demand.  Starbucks and the 1875 food court will be open subject to demand. You will be encouraged to use the app to order food to avoid queues.  There will be full access to library and study space facilities. </p>\n<p>Providing you with the guidance you need</p>\n<p>Although we plan to pause our regular coronavirus email updates until the latter half of August, we will communicate any significant updates and guidance by email, social media, and the website, as necessary. Please remember that the coronavirus section on the University website will normally be the best place for you to find up-to-date information on our plans.</p>\n<p>Whilst we will be operating under these transitional arrangements during semester one, and possibly semester two of the next academic session, work is also taking place to support consideration of the future way we will work and operate as a university.  Our initial thoughts, and details of how you can be involved in any consequent change process, will be shared with staff in the coming months. Please be assured that any decisions in this area would only be taken following consultation with staff and trade union representatives.</p>\n<p>Listening to you</p>\n<p>We appreciate that your feelings about a return to a more 'normal' way of working will vary according to your personal circumstances and experiences of home/on-campus working over the last year. If you have questions or concerns about our route map, your line manager is your first port of call. They, or you, can call on your Senior Leadership Team (SLT) member as appropriate for further advice. SLT staff are all members of our Business Continuity Group that oversees our approach to managing COVID.</p>\n<p>We plan to arrange a ‘Meet the Principal’ Teams Live session prior to the start of the academic session which will provide an opportunity for you to ask any questions you may have about the return to campus, and university activities more generally.</p>\n<p><strong>Professor Richard Butt, Deputy Principal</strong><br /><strong>Malcolm G Cutt, Director of Operations &amp; Finance</strong></p>\n<p> </p>"

The events will provide the opportunity for students to wear their graduation gown; have their professional photo taken; celebrate with friends, family and staff; and enjoy some QMU hospitality.</p>\n<p>Eligible students/graduates and up to two guests can attend on either Tuesday 13 July or Wednesday 14 July depending on availability. However, places will be limited and bookings will be dealt with on a first come, first served basis. In order to manage the number of people on campus at any one time, and to comply with safety requirements, the event will run from 11.00 am to 7.00 pm over each of the two days. Graduates and their guests will be asked to book a specific timeslot. Graduation information and timeslots are available on the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/cfd71ebad1404308898f173ad553c662}\" title=\"Graduation 2020\">graduation page of the QMU website</a>. <strong>Registration opens to graduating students on Tuesday 8<sup>th</sup> June</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Staff message - 4 June 2021</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues, </p>\n<h2>East Lothian to move into Level 1 from Saturday 5 June</h2>\n<p>As announced in the First Minister’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/cautious-easing-of-restrictions/\">update on Tuesday 1 June</a>, East Lothian is one of fifteen Scottish mainland local authority areas to move down from Level 2 to Level 1 restrictions.

We would very much like to encourage academic staff to attend the event and, where possible, make arrangements to meet up with graduates and their cohorts. It will undoubtedly enhance the overall student experience and is a fitting way for new graduates to conclude their time at QMU. We can also make arrangements for academic staff to wear their gowns – please give your gown details when you book if Registry does not already hold these.</p>\n<p>In order to allow us to manage the number of people on campus at any one time, <strong>academic staff will need to book their place at the event via our Events team</strong>. We would therefore recommend that, if possible, academic staff liaise with their students/graduating cohorts in an attempt to confirm which timeslot would be most suitable to marry up the appropriate staff with their students. We very much appreciate staff involvement in graduation and wish to avoid a situation where academics attend the celebration but miss out on the opportunity to meet their students. We appreciate that there is no ideal system to facilitate the perfect coordination of staff and students this year, but we can all try to make it work as best we can by avoiding leaving booking until the last minute. We are aware that certain teams have chosen to split up attendance amongst their colleagues making sure that there is always one person from their subject area for the duration of the event on both days.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice of timeslots for graduates and guests on both days:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>11am – 1pm</li>\n<li>2pm – 4pm</li>\n<li>5pm – 7pm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It will be essential for all academic staff who plan to attend the graduation celebration to meet with their student groups, to book their place in advance.  We will open registration for academic staff a week after graduate registration has opened so you have time to find out what time slot your students will be attending. <strong>Registration for academic staff will open on Monday 14 June.</strong> Please email <a href=\"mailto:events@qmu.ac.uk\">events@qmu.ac.uk</a> to register. Bookings for academic staff will be dealt with on a first come first served basis. For those staff requiring an academic gown, bookings must be made by Friday 25 June at the very latest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>"

You can also meet indoors in Maggie’s, in groups of up to 3 households (up to 6 people).  Please do stick to the rules as it puts our Campus Services colleagues in an awkward position if we fail to comply. Thank you.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"> </p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Director of Operations and Finance</p>"

One local East Lothian councillor described the University as ‘an oasis of calm’ during the pandemic.  The chair of the Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council expressed ‘a big thank you’ to the University for ‘incredible’ work during COVID which had been ‘well talked about’ and merited ‘a gold star’.  Thank you to all of you for all you have done, and continue to do. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Professor Richard Butt </p>\n<p>Deputy Principal</p>"

As the Principal said, we know all too well how disappointing this will be for graduating students, and for those graduates who missed out last year, which is why we are working to find another way to mark this important milestone in their academic journey, planning to provide them with the opportunity to come together safely, and in an appropriately socially distanced way with their QMU friends, to celebrate their achievements with family and supporters.

This would mean a further relaxation of the restrictions, including freedom to travel within mainland Scotland and perhaps to the rest of the UK, opening of museums, galleries and tourist destinations and some (mainly outdoor) hospitality. </p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">What this means for QMU </p>\n<p>The Senior Leadership Team and Business Continuity Group are working through the implications of these possible relaxations for the University.  Any possible increased opportunities for students to interact face-to-face on campus will be communicated at programme level, and working from home for staff, other than in cases where staff have been advised that they need to be present on campus, remains the default position for now.  We will let you know through future COVID updates about further opening up of catering facilities from 26 April and any relaxations in the current adaptations to LRC use. </p>\n<p>The Students’ Union has been looking into the implications of the previously announced relaxations on outdoor non-contact sport.  Unfortunately, as there are still restrictions preventing students from crossing local authority boundaries, it is still very challenging to facilitate sport right now. </p>\n<p aria-level=\"2\">Guidance on student travel over Easter </p>\n<p>As only essential travel beyond your local authority area will be allowed at Easter time, the Scottish Government is planning to issue travel guidance for students.

This means that these regulations will continue for the remainder of academic year 2020/21. </p>\n<p>Senate also agreed to extend the period of time over which Boards of Examiners can be held during the COVID pandemic. This means that some students may receive their exam results a little later than originally planned. The published Academic Calendar for Session 2020-21 advises students and staff that assessment, progression and award decisions will be published on 14 June 2021.  Assessment results will now be released by 28 June 2021 at the latest. Programme and cohort marks approved by Boards of Examiners before this date will be released to students as soon as possible.  This means that, for this academic year, student assessment results will not be released simultaneously from all Boards of Examiners on a single date.    </p>\n<p>For COVID-related reasons, Senate also approved a delay to the start of academic year 2021/22 with induction week starting Monday 13 September 2021 and Semester 1 commencing on Monday 20 September 2021.

If you are an undergraduate student currently being taught online and have not heard from your programme leader yet, you will very soon.  Any changes to your timetable will be reflected in the published timetable too. </p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">There may also be some minor timetable changes for those Health Sciences students who are already receiving in-person teaching, and postgraduate students in ASSaM should anticipate changes to what had previously been scheduled, as a consequence of universities remaining in phase 1 of the Scottish Government’s staggered return.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">In general, all students should continue to check their timetable for any updates to their timetabled teaching given the dynamic situation in which we remain.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><strong>Other updates</strong></p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">· Quarantine hotels: in our <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/4da50204dcaa4c608ee3d0a49f0438c5}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"International\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">international student coronavirus FAQs</a>, we have published information on new laws regarding international travel and the requirement for managed isolation (ie ‘quarantine hotels’). If this issue could affect you, please contact our international team with any queries (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"mailto:international@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">international@qmu.ac.uk</a>) after you have read the published information.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">· Taking COVID into account when it comes to assessments and degree classifications:  during the coronavirus pandemic, the University has undertaken significant work to address the many challenges associated with COVID for learning, teaching and assessment. All possible steps have been taken to protect student progression, achievement and completion, and to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by necessary adjustments to programme delivery or assessment.  It is with this firmly in mind, and with the support of the Students’ Union, that our Student Experience Committee recommended at its meeting on 17 February that the current version of the emergency regulations, which took effect on 1 October 2020, should continue for the remainder of academic session 2020/21. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/e9f078ecf44140bda12e1de86b67d0a5}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Updated Assessment Regulations\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">These regulations can be found on our website</a>.  This recommendation will be put to the University Senate when it meets on 17 March. Students with individual extenuating circumstances should continue to follow the usual process for requesting extensions via the Student Portal.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">· COVID asymptomatic testing on campus for students: our testing centre is open (for one day) on Monday from 11am to 3pm. You can <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/coronavirus/test/\" target=\"_blank\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">book online</a>. Walk-up appointments will also be available.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">· Coronavirus Discretionary Fund: the University has received a substantial addition to our funds to help upport any student, regardless of their fee category, who faces financial difficulties caused by COVID. The reasons could include being unable to secure rent rebates from landlords and difficulties in finding part-time employment, but all reasons for applying will be considered. For more information, see the separate Moderator message being issued today then <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/8289ea3f25cd4651a34f61302879db16}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Application for Financial Assistance\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">apply on our website</a><span> (before 25 March).</span><span></span></p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Thank you for your continued patience with the ongoing restrictions, and their impacts on your lives. Rest assured you have our unwavering commitment to addressing your needs at this time and do remember that staff are here to help you.  In particular, remember that you can call on our <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a33d92be97574482967def19ff8a302f}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Student Services\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">Student Services</a> team, and do check out our <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a33d92be97574482967def19ff8a302f}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Student Services\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">wellbeing resources</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Director of Operations and Finance</p>"

      "content": "<p>12 February 2021</p>\n<p>For Students and Staff:</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE ON STAGGERED RETURN OF UNDERGRADUATE IN-PERSON TEACHING</strong></p>\n<p>It is expected that the First Minister will give an update in parliament on the Scottish Government’s position on the staggered return of in-person undergraduate teaching this coming Tuesday. Alongside this, universities have been liaising with Scottish Government officials on the detail of the arrangements for the staggered return.  We will update you on our plans as soon as we can after Tuesday, informed by what the First Minister says.  We do understand that you will be finding the uncertainty frustrating, and thank you for your patience.</p>\n<p><strong>AVAILABILITY OF ASYMPTOMATIC COVID TESTING</strong></p>\n<p>Any student (without COVID symptoms) who needs to return to term-time accommodation just now can arrange a COVID test through the University of Edinburgh, with information on this available on the <a href=\"https://u.qmu.ac.uk/live/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn\">QMU student portal</a>.  If you do believe that you need to return to term-time accommodation, remember, of course, to take full account of the rules associated with such a move.  You can find the rules and guidance on the Scottish Government’s <a href=\"https://www.studentinformation.gov.scot/coronavirus/term-two\">Student Information Scotland website</a>.  We will announce further dates for the operation of our own testing centre in due course, in line with demand and the staggered return.</p>\n<p><strong>NEW INTERNATIONAL QUARANTINE REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the Scottish Government advised that all international travellers coming directly into Scotland will have to go into managed isolation, ie quarantining in specified hotels near their arrival airport for 10 days, with travellers bearing the cost. We are conscious that this announcement will be causing concern for international students, and indeed all QMU students currently overseas.  We expect to receive more information from government soon, including information on whether there will be any special arrangements for students. When we do have more information, we will post it on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/4da50204dcaa4c608ee3d0a49f0438c5}\" title=\"International\">coronavirus FAQS for international students</a>, and share it in our next COVID update.  </p>\n<p><strong>VACCINATION CENTRE OPEN</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone on campus will have been cheered by seeing the NHS-operated vaccination centre open on Wednesday.  Everything seems to be going very smoothly, with lots of smiling faces amongst NHS and facilities staff, and those taking up vaccination appointments, on what was a very cold and snowy opening day.  Our own Campus Services staff were on the scene before dawn, clearing the access routes of snow.  On behalf of the Senior Leadership Team, I thank all the QMU staff involved in helping to set up the centre.   This project has been a wonderful example of partnership work.</p>\n<p>If any member of the public on campus asks you about the vaccination centre, we would ask you to direct questions to the vaccination centre staff (all of whom wear hi-vis jackets) rather than to try to answer questions yourself.  More generally, you can direct questions to the NHS’s COVID-19 vaccination helpline on 0800 030 8013 or NHS Lothian’s ‘<a href=\"https://www.nhslothian.scot/Coronavirus/Vaccine/Pages/default.aspx\"><strong>Vaccine Hub</strong></a>’ website.</p>\n<p><strong>REMINDER TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS</strong></p>\n<p>If you do need to be on campus, please remember that, as required by Scottish Government regulations, face coverings must now be worn in classrooms and other teaching spaces, in addition to all other communal spaces, including the LRC, except by those who are legally exempt for medical reasons. Face coverings will continue to be required in classrooms and other teaching spaces until we return to the Scottish Government’s COVID Level 3 or lower. The requirement to wear face coverings applies at all times, except when you are eating or drinking. As we all struggle to remember the rules from time to time, none of us should feel hesitant about reminding anyone else to wear a face covering, or to keep their distance.</p>\n<p><strong>For Staff:</strong></p>\n<p>And a final note to staff – as you will know from my last update, there is now an online ‘Working Safely on Campus’ e-learning module to be completed by all staff who currently attend campus and those who are planning to return to campus. It takes just 10 minutes to complete and is designed to ensure that you are familiar with the COVID workplace adaptations we have implemented to keep you safe, and your role and responsibilities while on campus.  An email containing all the necessary log in details is being sent to all staff who are required to complete the training. If you are required to attend campus, look out for this email.  If you haven’t received this email and think you should have done, please contact the Health &amp; Safety Adviser (<a href=\"mailto:MKennedy1@qmu.ac.uk\">MKennedy1@qmu.ac.uk</a>).</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>"

For those who couldn’t attend, there is an <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/news/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1755\">audio recording (intranet link)</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Scottish Government Q&amp;As for students</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.studentinformation.gov.scot/coronavirus/term-two\">Scottish Government has now published Q&amp;As for students on semester two</a>. The Q&amp;As include advice on when students can return, student accommodation and travel.  Key points are reflected in our own coronavirus FAQs. As you will know from my <a href=\"/coronavirus/updates/\">last update</a> (22 January), we can’t yet confirm details of the staggered return to in-person teaching from 22 February for those currently studying online, but I can reassure you that we will give you as much notice as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Other updates from the Scottish Government</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the Scottish Government announced an additional £30m funding for the higher education sector, including £20 million for additional student support and £10 million to universities to mitigate the additional costs of refunding student accommodation fees.  It will be a little time before we know what this means specifically for QMU.</p>\n<p><strong>On-campus COVID testing</strong></p>\n<p>Today is the last asymptomatic student testing session on campus for the moment. In due course, we will announce further testing dates, aligned with the staggered return to face to face teaching and demand levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaccination centre on campus</strong></p>\n<p>There is growing interest in the vaccination centre on campus, now that construction is well underway and the authorities have issued the first invitations to appointments.  As you will appreciate, this centre is being run by NHS Lothian, and not the University. If any member of the community has questions about the virus or the vaccination centre based at QMU, we would ask that you direct them to the NHS’s COVID vaccination helpline on 0800 030 8013.</p>\n<p><strong>Update on the full range of student services available at this time</strong></p>\n<p>Also today, you will have received a Moderator message with an updated summary of the full range of support services for students across the University and how to contact them. From Monday 25 January some of the service reception points have been temporarily closed or are operating on reduced opening hours. However, each support service remains open and accessible to all students, whether studying on campus or remotely.  You can find a copy of the message on the <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/SitePages/Home.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fservices%2Fcampus%2Dcommercial%2Dservices%2Fcovid19%2FShared%20Documents%2FStaff%2DSpecific%20Communications%20%28see%20also%20staff%20and%20student%20updates%20on%20the%20coronavirus%20web%20pages%29&amp;FolderCTID=0x012000C1132186DEE92D428CC43D5EFC1B31AF&amp;View=%7B9840A612%2D80E9%2D4272%2D941B%2DEB989655D2B1%7D\">COVID section of the intranet</a> (in the documents folder on that site, under staff messages).</p>\n<p><strong>Advice for students who need to come to the campus</strong></p>\n<p>We are aware of a small number of students who have been challenged by the authorities when travelling to campus to attend face-to-face classes.  Any student who is challenged in this way and who needs to attend campus for face-to-face teaching can request an official letter from the University confirming that they have classes on campus. To do so, they should contact the School Office. If a student is travelling to campus for a welfare appointment or to use the library, they can show the authorities their online booking. </p>\n<p><strong>QMYouMove </strong></p>\n<p>In the course of today, the Students’ Union will share details of ‘QMYouMove’, a six week activity challenge for students, staff and the wider QMU community, which will start next week. I know there is already quite a lot of interest in this initiative, as we all try to keep ourselves motivated to get fresh air and exercise during the current COVID restrictions. </p>\n<p><strong>Interesting research going on at QMU</strong></p>\n<p>You might also find it cheering to read about some of the fascinating and highly relevant research projects going on right now within the University, including projects directly associated with COVID.  We’ve created a section of our website bringing together <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/cc05e446ed6542dd99cfa00599b78d88}\" title=\"Covid-19\">projects funded by the Scottish Government to help mitigate of effects of the pandemic on research</a>.  There, you can learn, for example, how we are exploring ‘<a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/665c1315ef6046b69232a8220bfe694c}\" title=\"Film festivals, audiences and Covid-19; Crisis, community and digital comeback.\">Film festivals, audiences and Covid-19; crisis, community and digital comeback.’</a> and ‘<a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/adc523e1b7a7459589679d1a88599ac1}\" title=\"Community, health and social care system stressors and coping mechanisms during  COVID 19 in Edinburgh, Scotland\">Community, health and social care system stressors and coping mechanisms during COVID-19’</a>.

In summary, with the exception of essential face-to-face sessions for pre-registration Health Sciences courses and time-critical practical sessions for a very small number of courses in the School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management, all undergraduate course delivery is currently online. Scottish Government guidance indicates that this will continue to be the case until 22 February at the earliest, from which point there will be a staggered return to face-to-face delivery. Programme teams have been advising students where classes previously planned for face-to-face delivery have moved to online. All such changes are reflected in the published timetable.</p>\n<p>Delivery of teaching for the School of Health Sciences remains the same as that indicated in your updated timetables issued this week (week commencing 11 January). Delivery of teaching for the School of Arts Social Sciences and Management is detailed on the website.</p>\n<p>In line with the further tightening of Scottish Government guidance to universities, postgraduate provision will continue to be offered through blended provision, but until at least the end of January face-to-face teaching will only be scheduled for essential, time-critical activities that cannot be moved online. The balance between online and face-to-face teaching will depend on your programme. For postgraduate students in both schools, any further necessary changes will be communicated to affected students by the programme teams and reflected in your timetable. If, after consulting your timetable you are still unsure as to the current mode of delivery of your programme, please contact your programme leader for guidance.</p>\n<p>When to travel and return to term-time accommodation</p>\n<p>We are still planning on a staggered return of students who are currently studying entirely online to a blend of on-campus and online delivery from 22 February. This return will be based on evolving government guidance, and on prioritising those modules where in-person teaching is most essential and time critical. As I said in my last update, we suggest that you do not arrange travel to return to campus until details of this staggered return are published.</p>\n<p>As set out in my last update, and based on Scottish Government guidance, we advise that you should not return to your term-time accommodation more than 48 hours before your first face-to-face class. For international students and students travelling back to University from outside the UK, you should consider, if you are not already in the UK and have not yet booked your travel, staying in your home country and accessing your learning from home to start with. When you do return to your term-time accommodation, you must follow the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-student-home-visits/pages/students-returning-after-the-winter-break/\" target=\"_blank\">guidance on international travel, including COVID testing pre-travel, and quarantine requirements.</a> We are, of course, supporting students during quarantine as set out in our coronavirus <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/8b50dee69adb4c65a6b2b361f6f4244d}\" title=\"International\" data-udi=\"umb://document/8b50dee69adb4c65a6b2b361f6f4244d\">FAQs for international students</a>.</p>\n<p>Things to consider before you return to term-time accommodation</p>\n<p>When you know when you are returning, please <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/cea350dc0ea8419584357d9503e1a8a9}\" title=\"Student (COVID-19 Test) Booking\" data-udi=\"umb://document/cea350dc0ea8419584357d9503e1a8a9\">book a COVID test</a> (tests are also available to students who have stayed on campus over the winter break).

If you are one of these students, please resist the temptation to gather in groups with your friends to chat before and after the sessions. We know it is hard, but we must all observe the rules on social gatherings at all times.</p>\n<p>Please remember that, as required by Scottish Government regulations, face coverings must now be worn in classrooms and other teaching spaces, in addition to all other communal spaces, including the LRC, except by those who are legally exempt for medical reasons. Face coverings will continue to be required in classrooms and other teaching spaces until we return to the Scottish Government’s COVID Level 3 or lower.</p>\n<p>The requirement to wear face coverings applies at all times, except when you are eating or drinking</p>\n<p>Reporting self-isolation and coronavirus</p>\n<p>Please also remember that you need to tell us if you are self-isolating, suspect you have coronavirus or have been diagnosed with coronavirus.

Please note that you need to book a study space, rather than simply arrive and find yourself a space.</p>\n<p>Student Services</p>\n<p>I will take this opportunity to remind you Student Services and Registry reception desks are staffed face to face daily between 10am and 2pm, as is Students’ Union reception desk. Face to face appointments are available with Student Services and the Students’ Union where this appropriate, as well as online appointments, of course.</p>\n<p>Catering</p>\n<p>As you know, our catering and shop services are limited to takeaway or delivery only right now. In light of the tighter COVID restrictions announced by the Scottish Government this week, Maggie's will still be open for pre-orders and deliveries across campus through the 'Round' app. If you are unable to use Round you will be able to order in person from outside Maggie’s – but we will not be allowing anyone access to the building.

      "content": "<p>Dear students and staff</p>\n<p>First of all, thank you for your patience and forbearance as we work to resolve and clarify the issues arising out of the tighter national COVID restrictions. As I’m sure you can imagine, since the First Minister’s announcement on Monday of this week of a further temporary period of lockdown, a significant amount of effort has gone in to reassessing our arrangements to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our students and staff. We have also undertaken a full review of our University-wide risk assessment and various local risk assessments, to take account of the new restrictions and the potential risks posed by the new strain of coronavirus. </p>\n<p>As you know, these new restrictions are designed to help limit the spread of the new variant of the virus, and will be supported by the national vaccination programme that is currently being rolled out across the UK, including a <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/45682b7463bd406b850e359eb18dc4ab}\" title=\"2020.12.24 - Queen Margaret University set to be one of the first venues in Lothian for the mass COVID-19 vaccination programme\">planned vaccination centre on our own campus</a>. </p>\n<p>We do appreciate that the current situation may be causing you frustration and worry, whatever your personal circumstances, so we will attempt to provide answers to as many questions as we can, based on current information.</p>\n<p>We worked extensively with Universities Scotland and the Scottish Government before the Christmas break to implement a staggered return to on-campus teaching, to limit the numbers of students and staff that require to be on campus in the early stages of the second semester.  We have made arrangements for programmes which involve essential practical learning, including pre-placement practical skills for health students, to re-commence on campus. </p>\n<p>Following the First Minister’s statement earlier today and the publication of a statement from the Minister for Higher Education, we have made some further decisions on the mode of course delivery, to help provide as many of you as possible with greater certainty. I set out details of these decisions below and I would like to emphasise that semester two is starting on 11 January as planned, although the mode of delivery will be different from that initially planned in some cases. All adaptations to course delivery are designed to address the tighter national COVID restrictions introduced at the start of January and subsequent advice from government.</p>\n<p><strong>Decisions made on mode of course delivery</strong></p>\n<p>For those undergraduate students in the School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management (ASSaM) timetabled to begin face-to face-classes before 25th January, some of that delivery will now be moved online, and this will initially be communicated to you by the programme teams.  Any changes will also be reflected in your timetable shortly.</p>\n<p>For all other undergraduate students in ASSaM, ie those timetabled to return to face-to-face classes on or after 25th January, all teaching will now be online until after the timetabled reading week, which begins on 15<sup>th</sup> February. There will be a few changes to the advertised mode of delivery for undergraduate Health Sciences programmes. In due course, and informed by government guidance, we will provide details of a staggered return to face to face teaching for these students from week commencing 22nd February, prioritising those modules where in-person teaching is most essential. We suggest you do not arrange travel to return to campus until details of this staggered return are published. Your programme team will advise you of any changes and, as ever, please keep checking your timetable for any changes.  </p>\n<p>Whilst we do not anticipate any substantial changes to the mode of delivery of postgraduate level courses, some of that delivery may now be moved online, and this will initially be communicated to you by the programme teams.  Any changes will also shortly be reflected in your timetable.</p>\n<p><strong>Campus services</strong></p>\n<p>As previously communicated, l<a href=\"/study-here/learning-facilities/library/\">ibrary services</a> are operational, with some adaptation (details to be published on the <a href=\"/study-here/learning-facilities/library/\">library website</a> later today), and <a href=\"/campus-life/eat-and-shop-on-campus/\">catering</a> is available, on a takeaway basis. The atrium tiers and 1875 have been designated as a workplace canteen under the COVID regulations and so can be used by students and staff so long as they observe 2m social distancing. Face coverings should only be removed when eating and drinking.</p>\n<p><strong>When to return to term-time accommodation</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the latest government advice, we advise that you should not return to your term-time accommodation more than 48 hours before your first face-to-face class. Indeed in her media briefing today, the First Minister reiterated her message that the vast majority of students should stay at home just now. The exception to this is international students and students travelling back to university from outside the UK. These students can return to their term-time accommodation as they had already planned prior to the staggering of the resumption of face-to-face classes, as long as they follow the <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-student-home-visits/pages/students-returning-after-the-winter-break/\">guidance on international travel, including COVID testing pre-travel, and quarantine requirements</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>COVID testing when returning to campus</strong></p>\n<p>If you are a student returning to term-time accommodation, you should, before you travel, book your first COVID test for as soon as possible after your return to term-time accommodation, via our <a href=\"/coronavirus/test/student-covid-19-test-booking/\">booking tool</a>.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you are travelling from overseas, this service does not remove your need to self-isolate (quarantine) on entry to the UK; and you should not have a test at the centre during your isolation period.</p>\n<p><strong>More on travel</strong></p>\n<p>We know that the advice on travel can appear confusing.  If you have questions, we recommend that you look up the travel advice found on <a href=\"https://www.studentinformation.gov.scot/coronavirus/students-returning-home\">Scottish Government’s Student Information Scotland website</a>, and the links from that site to <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-travel-and-transport/\">further travel advice</a>.

Additional detail on how to apply for a rent reduction will be provided to students in campus accommodation directly by the accommodation team.</p>\n<p>Although we are advising that students should not return to their term-time accommodation until 48 hours before their first face to face class, students currently staying in University accommodation will of course continue to be supported and international students with pre-arranged travel may still arrive as they planned. Students unable to study at home can return to on-campus accommodation so long as that is permissible within the <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/\">exemptions to  the national regulations on travel at this time</a>  (such as if the return to term-time accommodation is to address mental health concerns or parental estrangement).</p>\n<p><strong>Wellbeing advice</strong></p>\n<p>Students, please do remember that staff are here to help you.  If you need support, do call on our <a href=\"/study-here/student-services/\">Student Services</a> team, or check out our <a href=\"/study-here/student-services/wellbeing-service/\">wellbeing resources</a>. We also plan to hold online question &amp; answer sessions for students in the next few days – please keep an eye on Moderator messages for more information about this.

Core face-to-face services to students and staff remain in place as per last semester, but the new restrictions mean that we can only offer a takeaway service in our catering outlets, and that changes are required to how our Learning Resource Centre operates (details will be published on the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/71b99825061d4a2e8bd48daeb9d7cfe2}\" title=\"Library\">Library website</a>).  Face coverings are now required in all communal spaces on campus, including in classrooms, and will continue to be required until we return to the Scottish Government’s COVID Level 3 or lower.</p>\n<p>As you would expect, we are updating our risk assessments and processes to take into account the increased transmissibility of new variant of COVID.</p>\n<p>Where the new restrictions require us to make any changes to the delivery of teaching scheduled to begin <em>before</em> 25 January, we will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum. Any changes will be communicated to you by your programme leader.  We also encourage you to continue to check your timetable. Programme start dates remain as previously advised.</p>\n<p>The Scottish Government Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science has written to University principals, indicating that those students set to return to face-to-face classes <em>on or after </em>25 January “should expect their return to be delayed, hopefully to a minimum”. We expect to receive more detailed guidance from the government on this in the next few days, and we plan to provide you with any updates to start dates within the next week, based on that guidance.  If your programme is scheduled to start on or after 25 January and you have yet to book your travel, you may wish to hold off from doing so until you receive our update. Otherwise, the advice on planning travel and your return to campus remains as per our update of <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/655742a31f25458f96f2d67439fb297a}\" title=\"Updates\">30 December</a>.</p>\n<p>Students who are shielding or who are unable to attend face to face lectures for other COVID-related reasons will be able to undertake their studies online. If you are in this situation, please contact Registry at registry@qmu.ac.uk. The exception to this is postgraduate pre-registration health care students who need to attend mandatory pre-placement face to face practical sessions by 25 January to be able to complete their programme of study within the required timeframe. If you have further questions about this, please contact Registry.</p>\n<p>As we have said before, international students and students travelling back to university from outside the UK can return to their term-time accommodation as planned, as long as they follow the <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-student-home-visits/pages/students-returning-after-the-winter-break/\"><strong>guidance on international travel and quarantine requirements</strong></a>.  The international team will be pleased to help with any queries (<a href=\"mailto:international@qmu.ac.uk\">international@qmu.ac.uk</a>).</p>\n<p>We are conscious that students with children may have concerns about the impact of managing their studies alongside their childcare responsibilities.

The exception to this is that anyone who is ‘shielding’ should not attend the campus.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, there is a clear expectation that those members of staff whose role involves face-to-face interaction with students, and those members of staff whose presence on campus is required to enable that interaction, will be present on campus on those days when that presence is required. This will apply to all members of academic staff involved in teaching, to members of staff in professional services areas who provide a face-to-face service to students, and to those staff whose role is such that their presence on campus is required for them to perform it. By way of contrast, those members of staff whose role does not involve any direct face-to-face contact with students, and who are able to carry out the duties of their role remotely, are expected to continue to work from home for the time being.</p>\n<p>If you are not sure whether you presence is deemed essential on campus, please ask your Head of Division or Service for advice. In turn, and if required, they can seek advice from their SLT member as appropriate.</p>\n<p>As I said in my update last week, the Senior Leadership Team is conscious that some colleagues with younger school age children may have concerns associated with delivering face-to-face or synchronous teaching when schools are still closed/only delivering teaching online. Staff in this situation should contact their Head of Division.</p>\n<p>Staff members who consider that their home situation is such that they cannot work from home should speak to their Head of Division or Service in the first instance. Please remember that advice on working from home is available on the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/5c334dbad1fc4fd298200b477c4b3a79}\" title=\"At Home\">QMU@Home section of the University website</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding at this time.</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>"

In the meantime, the previously announced arrangements will continue to apply. Also, please note that travel for educational purposes is permitted, as it remains a valid exception to the more general travel restrictions.</p>\n<p>As staff are currently working from home except where their presence on campus is essential, we do not anticipate that today’s announcement will affect where staff will work from tomorrow, when the campus reopens.

This is intended to reduce the risks of the transmission of COVID.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Scottish Government has asked that undergraduate students only return to university when their in-person teaching is scheduled to resume. However, if you need to come back to the university for health or wellbeing reasons, or because your home environment makes study difficult, or because you lack access to the technology you need to learn, you can return to your term-time address as you had planned.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Scottish Government asks students, on a voluntary basis, to reduce social mixing for two weeks before returning to University, and for two weeks afterwards.</p>\n<p>It is important to stress that only undergraduate students from Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are being asked to delay their return to campus. International students and students travelling back to university from outside the UK can return to their term-time accommodation as planned, as long as they follow the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-student-home-visits/pages/students-returning-after-the-winter-break/\" target=\"_blank\">guidance on international travel and quarantine requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate students should return to university as normal, and teaching will resume as currently planned.</p>\n<p>These new guidelines are neither rules nor laws, but they are requests from government designed to minimise the increased risks of the spread of COVID at the start of the semester. Wherever possible, we should do what we can to support them. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-student-home-visits/pages/students-returning-after-the-winter-break/\" target=\"_blank\">The full Scottish Government guidance is available on their website (and they plan to provide Q&amp;As for students).</a></p>\n<p>What will this mean at QMU</p>\n<p>If you are an undergraduate student, when you receive your timetable, (as some of you will already have done) you might find that, depending on your programme and level, your earlier classes in January might be delivered online rather than in person. This is to allow for the staggered return to campus in January for those studying at undergraduate level.</p>\n<p>Many of our undergraduate programmes are practical in nature, and include placement and other practical activity at the start of semester two, a significant volume of which is a prerequisite to subsequent placement activity. As a result, a high proportion of our delivery falls within the activity exempted under the Scottish Government guidance i.e. critical and time-sensitive learning, and work placements that cannot be delivered remotely or postponed.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate students will be unaffected by any changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/d1ff6c6ae4d64b76b0389621aa9718bf}\" title=\"Christmas Closure Dates\" data-udi=\"umb://document/4a7d426476164663ae5b9495f09d54a6\">All University services and facilities will be open from the very start of the semester, with special arrangements in place for the Christmas closure period as previously advised.</a></p>\n<p>We don’t expect the advice or guidance to change, but were it do so over the Christmas closure period, rest assured we would update you via Moderator, Facebook and our website.</p>\n<p>Students living in University accommodation</p>\n<p>A separate message will be sent out shortly from our Accommodation Office to students living in our on campus University accommodation which will address the implications of the Scottish Government request that some students delay their return to campus after the winter break.</p>\n<p>COVID testing</p>\n<p>As communicated earlier in the week, we will be offering asymptomatic COVID testing on campus in the new year for students returning to term-time accommodation. We will update you on the details as soon as we can. Please note that taking a COVID test will not exempt you from the general request to all students to reduce social mixing during the first two weeks you are back on campus.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Early next week, we are expecting the Scottish Government to announce details of its approach to the return of students to campuses in the new year. As we have advised already, it seems likely that student testing will form part of the government’s plans. You will no doubt have seen that the UK Government has already announced its approach to the resumption of teaching next semester in England.</p>\n<p>We also recognise that some students will wish to remain on campus over the Christmas and new year period.

Under the regulations of the scheme the University has purchased laptops which can be loaned out to students for the duration of their course.</p>\n<p>We realise that some students face particular financial difficulties and priority will be given to the same group that are a priority for the Discretionary (Hardship) Funds. These will be students who are care experienced, carers, estranged, single parents, young students in receipt of the young student bursary, and mature students in receipt of the mature student bursary. But applications are not limited to these students, and all applications will be looked at on a case by case basis.</p>\n<p>Please email <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:technologysupportfund@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">technologysupportfund@qmu.ac.uk</a> if you wish to apply for the long term loan of a laptop, giving a brief explanation of your circumstances. You will then be sent the link to the short online application form along with information about the evidence you will need to submit to support your application. This will normally be evidence of funding from your funding authority (eg SAAS) and a recent bank statement.</p>"

This is the advice for all of us in Scotland at this time, but it is most vital to those of you changing residence from a high COVID protection level area to a lower level, and those who are returning to households with vulnerable family members.

      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Ministerial statement on Supporting Students to Return Home Safely at the End of Semester</strong></span></p>\n<p>Dear students and staff</p>\n<p>Richard Lochhead, the Scottish Government’s Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science, today made a statement in the Scottish Parliament on supporting students to return home safely at the end of this semester.</p>\n<p>After expressing his thanks to University students and staff for all their efforts so far to enable teaching and learning to continue this semester and to protect our communities, Mr Lochhead set out measures to support students to return home safely or change household for the winter break, with such measures being designed to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus.  </p>\n<p>The measures are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staggered departures of students, to be achieved through variation in term end dates between Scottish universities. This measure is in place already, and there will be no change to the University’s published session dates.</li>\n<li>Asking students to voluntarily reduce their contact with others for two weeks before they return home or change household. This is line with what we are all being asked to do at this time.</li>\n<li>Offering (voluntary) testing to all students who are planning to move from their term time address. This will be administered by universities, and we are in early discussion about potential arrangements at QMU. The test kits used will be ‘lateral flow devices’ which deliver a result within an hour. Students who take part will be tested twice over five days if they have a negative result.  Those who return a positive result will be asked to self-isolate, with the testing exercise timed to enable any students who need to self-isolate to return home or change household before Christmas. Students with a negative test result will still be asked to continue to limit their social contacts, of course.</li>\n<li>Provision of guidance on safe travel, to be published soon.</li>\n<li>Provision of “questions and answers” for students in the near future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mr Lochhead also emphasised that universities will provide support for students who choose not to return home or change household, and I can confirm we are making such provision at QMU.</p>\n<p>Mr Lochhead confirmed further that work is ongoing in terms of planning for the safe return of students to campus in the New Year. You can read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/ministerial-statement-universities-colleges-supporting-students-return-home-safely-end-term/\">full wording of the minister’s speech on the Scottish Government website</a>.  <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/ministerial-statement-universities-colleges-supporting-students-return-home-safely-end-term/\"></a></p>\n<p>Having been involved in sector-wide discussions, the University is well prepared to deliver what the minister has asked for, and we are currently finalising our response.  We will update you with further details as soon as we can. In the meantime, I encourage you to remember FACTS: face coverings, avoid crowded places, clean hands regularly, two metre social distancing and self isolate, and book a test if you have symptoms.</p>\n<p>I will take this opportunity to address a question that some of you have been asking recently, and that is whether staff and students should wear face coverings in classrooms, now that this is a requirement in school classrooms in level 3 COVID protection areas. The answer is that face coverings are not required in our classrooms, unless physical distancing is compromised for some reason. The position with physical distancing differs within schools.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

I am sure you will see the campaign on social media in the next few days. The campaign highlights the advice on managing mental health and wellbeing that you can find on the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://clearyourhead.scot/\" target=\"_blank\">Clear Your Head website,</a> and we have added a link to this site on our coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>As we approach the middle of the semester, the<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/P6VN7HK\"> Students’ Union is running a survey on learning.</a> I hope that you’ve seen it already, but if you haven’t, you still have a couple of days to complete it before it closes. Thank you to all you who have already taken the time to fill it in, as your opinions could shape next semester and are very much valued. It only takes five minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>A short update this week:</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who attended either of the Chat with the Senior Leadership Team sessions this week. With well over 100 participants there were lots of interesting questions and chat.  You can access the recordings online under Documents on the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/SitePages/Home.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fservices%2Fcampus%2Dcommercial%2Dservices%2Fcovid19%2FShared%20Documents%2FSMT%20Live%20Stream%20Videos&amp;FolderCTID=0x012000C1132186DEE92D428CC43D5EFC1B31AF&amp;View=%7B9840A612%2D80E9%2D4272%2D941B%2DEB989655D2B1%7D\" target=\"_blank\" data-anchor=\"?RootFolder=%2Fservices%2Fcampus%2Dcommercial%2Dservices%2Fcovid19%2FShared%20Documents%2FSMT%20Live%20Stream%20Videos&amp;FolderCTID=0x012000C1132186DEE92D428CC43D5EFC1B31AF&amp;View=%7B9840A612%2D80E9%2D4272%2D941B%2DEB989655D2B1%7D\">COVID intranet landing page.</a></p>\n<p>A couple of participants highlighted media coverage on Tuesday around the publication of recommendations made by the UK Government’s SAGE group back on 21 September. The media coverage reported that, on 21 September, before the return of most students across the UK, SAGE had recommended all university and college teaching should be carried out online \"unless absolutely essential\".  At the Chat with the SLT, the Principal was asked for the University’s position on this. </p>\n<p>The University’s position is that it will follow Scottish Government advice (and, of course, it is government’s role to decide which SAGE group recommendations to adopt).  Both the UK and Scottish Governments have indicated that delivery of higher education is a priority, and in line with government advice, we are committed to continuing with blended learning. All face to face activity is, of course, subject to rigorous risk assessment and appropriate adaptations to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our staff and students. This remains our top priority and our risk assessments will be regularly reviewed to ensure we continue to comply with the latest guidance. It is also worth noting that there is no evidence across the sector of transmission of COVID in a classroom setting. </p>\n<p>Along with the rest of the sector, we would highlight the value of (very carefully managed) face to face teaching to promote student engagement in their learning, the ability of students to build peer networks, and student mental health, as well as the fact that there are practical aspects of many of our programmes that simply can’t be delivered online.</p>\n<p>Alongside this, some other participants at the Chat with the SLT session highlighted that they felt that students valued on campus teaching.</p>\n<p>The only other thing to point out this week is the Students’ Union’s survey on learning, the results of which will help to inform our approach to learning and teaching next semester. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/P6VN7HK\" target=\"_blank\">The survey is open until Monday, and so if you have the opportunity to encourage your students to complete it, that would be really helpful.</a> </p>"

      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\">Students </span></p>\n<p>Thank you again for the actions you are taking to help to control the virus. It really is making a difference, particularly in helping to contain any potential outbreaks in the student accommodation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Temporary restrictions announced by the Scottish Government</span></p>\n<p>But across the country and beyond the virus is spreading, and on Wednesday afternoon the First Minister announced <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/new-moves-to-stop-covid-19-spread\" target=\"_blank\">further (temporary) restrictions to reduce the reinfection rate and avoid the need for a full lockdown</a>. In her speech, she emphasised that universities remain open. The temporary restrictions - some of which are specific to the central belt region, which includes Edinburgh and the Lothians - focus mainly on hospitality, travel and public transport.</p>\n<p>For 16 days, from 6pm this evening until at least Sunday 25 October, we are being advised not to travel outside our own health board area (Lothian) if we don’t need to. We are also being asked to minimise the use of public transport as much as possible, other than for purposes such as travel for education, or for work (where it is not possible to work from home). Here in Lothian, licensed pubs and restaurants (ie those with a licence to serve alcohol) will be required to close, with the exception of takeaway services. However, cafes will be allowed to remain open between 6am and 6pm, whether they are licensed or unlicensed, as long as they don’t serve alcohol. Gyms may remain open during this period, but there can be no group exercise classes. Adult contact sports and training are also prohibited.</p>\n<p>On campus, this means that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 1875 food court will be open as usual.</li>\n<li>Starbucks will be open Monday to Friday, from 8.30am until 6pm.</li>\n<li>There will be a delivery service to the Starbucks spaces from Maggie’s, from 11am until 9pm, 7 days a week.</li>\n<li>Maggie’s will operate as a café selling meals, coffees and non-alcoholic beverages from 11am until 6pm each day. From 6-9 pm, Maggie’s will also be available to students living on campus, on a pre-booking basis only, in line with an exemption in the temporary restrictions which allows on-site dining facilities for students in student accommodation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will find more details on catering arrangements at the foot of this message.</p>\n<p>The government continues to consider that using public transport to travel to work or for the purposes of study is essential, including where that involves crossing Health Board boundaries within the central belt, and continues to support universities’ delivery of blended learning. We therefore very much encourage you to continue to attend face-to-face classes during the temporary restrictions, however you travel to the campus. However, if you feel you need to study online during this period, you can do so.

Given this, we have been able to pause our incident management group meetings, although we remain ready to step up the frequency again at very short notice if required. While our University Business Continuity Group continues to meet twice weekly, frequency of the Schools Business Continuity Group meetings has been reduced to fortnightly, as we have become more used to our new ways of teaching.</p>\n<p>Supporting our students at this time</p>\n<p>As I hope you know, staff across the University and Students’ Union have been working hard to support the small number of students in quarantine or self-isolation, for example through the Students’ Union’s Quarantine Coffees and through the Accommodation/ResLife team checking in regularly with self-isolating students. Along with the other Scottish higher education institutions, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/scotlands-universities-launch-consistent-core-of-care-for-students-during-the-pandemic/\" target=\"_blank\">we have signed up to a package of measures to ensure consistent care for students who are self-isolating,</a> and all students who are adjusting to a different model of study and wider student experience this semester. Colleagues throughout professional services areas have volunteered to field calls and e-mails from students to our dedicated phone line and e-mail inbox. While the inbox will remain open, the telephone line will close at the end of this week, as the number of calls has reduced significantly. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000n3x4/politics-scotland-30092020\" target=\"_blank\">Our Principal spoke about student support issues on BBC TV’s Politics Scotland show last week (30 September episode), and was able to give a good account of all of the measures we have put in place at QMU.</a> Thank you to each and every one of you who is supporting students in one way or another at this time.</p>\n<p>The temporary restrictions announced by the Scottish Government</p>\n<p>As you will know, on Wednesday afternoon the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/new-moves-to-stop-covid-19-spread\" target=\"_blank\">First Minister announced further (temporary) restrictions to reduce the reinfection rate and avoid the need for a full lockdown.</a> In her speech, she emphasised that universities remain open. The temporary restrictions - some of which are specific to the central belt region, which includes Edinburgh and the Lothians - focus mainly on hospitality, travel and public transport.</p>\n<p>For 16 days, from 6pm this evening until at least Sunday 25 October, we are being advised not to travel outside our own health board area (Lothian) if we don’t need to. We are also being asked to minimise the use of public transport as much as possible, other than for purposes such as travel for education, or for work (where it is not possible to work from home). Here in Lothian, licensed pubs and restaurants (ie those with a licence to serve alcohol) will be required to close, with the exception of takeaway services. However, cafes will be allowed to remain open between 6am and 6pm, whether they are licensed or unlicensed, as long as they don’t serve alcohol. Gyms may remain open during this period, but there can be no group exercise classes. Adult contact sports and training are also prohibited.</p>\n<p>On campus, this means that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 1875 food court will be open as usual.</li>\n<li>Starbucks will be open Monday – Friday, from 8.30am until 6pm.</li>\n<li>There will be a delivery service to the Starbucks spaces from Maggie’s, from 11am until 9pm, 7 days a week.</li>\n<li>Maggie’s will operate as a café selling meals, coffees and non-alcoholic beverages from 11am until 6pm each day. From 6-9 pm, Maggie’s will also be available to students living on campus, on a pre-booking basis only, in line with an exemption in the temporary restrictions which allows on-site dining facilities for students in student accommodation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will find more details on catering arrangements at the foot of this message.</p>\n<p>In our latest update to students, we have set out the impact of these restrictions on them. We have advised them that government continues to consider that using public transport to travel to work or for the purposes of study is essential, including where that involves crossing Health Board boundaries within the central belt. Accordingly, we have encouraged them to continue to attend face-to-face classes during the temporary restrictions, however they travel to the campus. Similarly, staff who are already attending campus delivering face-to-face teaching and providing direct support for students should continue to do this. We would also remind you that, if you are considering driving to the campus, parking restrictions remain suspended for the time being.</p>\n<p>More on semester two</p>\n<p>In my update of 25 September, I outlined our approach to teaching in semester two. We have now published an updated FAQ on that topic in the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2d74bbbb94e34467ab39bb1f82a83b2e}\" title=\"Students\" data-udi=\"umb://document/3c2ab7fe838b4338838be25fb3cb3741\">student</a> and <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/84daaed5f3d04cd09566859f91fb8d90}\" title=\"Applicants\" data-udi=\"umb://document/b5bb36d4fda2428e91f21e13e9059f0b\">applicant coronavirus FAQS</a>.

Working with the SU, we plan to carry out a short survey to hear more about your experience of blended learning this semester, partly so we can learn from that in preparing for semester two.  I can reaffirm our commitment to providing face-to-face teaching, as part of our blended model, throughout this academic year, so long as Government regulations allow. </p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The Scottish Government has addressed confusion about visiting home, in <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-what-you-can-and-cannot-do/pages/students/\" target=\"_blank\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">advice</a> released at the weekend. In short, the general advice is that you should not visit family at home (though there are some exceptions). This is to minimise the risk of spreading the virus. Whilst I appreciate it is not the same as visiting home, it is worth remembering that you can meet family members outdoors or in public indoor spaces such as cafes, pubs and restaurants, so long as you follow the ‘rule of six’.  </p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><strong>Getting support, and opportunities for recreation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">As I have said before, University staff understand that the current situation is very hard for you.  If you are feeling anxious or need support, do remember that we are here to help you. Contact <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a33d92be97574482967def19ff8a302f}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Student Services\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">Student Services</a> or the<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.qmusu.org.uk/top-menu/advice-support\" target=\"_blank\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\"> Students’ Union</a> for support. You might also want to sign up for <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"/study-here/student-services/togetherall/\" target=\"_blank\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">Togetherall</a>, which is available to you through the University.

Given this, I think you will glad to hear that our Students’ Union team is getting additional compliance advice on sports which we hope will enable us to get our sports teams and clubs back to (socially distanced) training as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><strong>Reporting self-isolation, symptoms and positive test results</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, I will remind you that it is important to tell us straight away if you are self-isolating, have coronavirus symptoms or have a positive coronavirus test.  You need to: (1) tell Security (0131 474 0000 ext 2222) - and also Accommodation (0131 474 0000 x 4902) if you live on campus; (2) Contact the School Office - <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"mailto:schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk</a>.

The two key points were a 10pm closing time for hospitality settings and a requirement that we do not meet people from any other households in our homes. Although the tightening of the rules is hard for everyone, I am sure you will agree that we all need to continue to play our part to help avoid the virus get out of control again.</p>\n<p>You will have seen the message from the Principal yesterday thanking you for your support so far in helping to reduce the spread of the virus, reiterating the importance of keeping up the effort, and asking you to take some additional short term steps. All of the senior leadership team are encouraged by the responsible way in which QMU students are responding to the restrictions we face. I know you will continue to do so, on campus, in our local neighbourhood, and across the city - particularly as there is real anxiety in our communities about the return of students to university campuses. I thank you sincerely for your support and I do understand how hard it is. And as well as behaving responsibly, as you are, I think each and every one of us can achieve so much simply by being kind and thoughtful towards one another at this time.</p>\n<p>Quite naturally, some of you have been asking about the rights and wrongs of the university asking you not to visit bars or other hospitality venues off campus over the weekend. Ultimately, this is voluntary.

We are currently firming up the details of our plans in response to the latest government guidance. Given the likely requirement for social distancing and other COVID-19 health and safety restrictions for the next six months, we are planning on maintaining our current blended approach to learning and teaching into semester two. While it is disappointing for all of us to have to continue to offer a reduced amount of on-campus learning and teaching activity, you will appreciate that we are required, for the health and wellbeing of all of us, to follow the government guidance. Those restrictions also mean that, as for this semester, we will not be holding on-campus written examinations at the end of semester two. We will issue another update to you when further details for semester two, including the timetable, become finalised. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">More guidance on self-isolation and what to do if you have symptoms</span></p>\n<p>As you will know from earlier communications, we have had our first COVID case on campus. As I said in my message on the subject, you can rest assured that the University has a robust approach in place to monitor and mitigate the impact of coronavirus, that the campus remains open for business as usual, and that the student is being supported along with their close contacts. </p>\n<p>If you need to book a COVID-19 test because you have developed symptoms (high temperature, a new continuous cough and/or a loss or change in sense of smell or taste) please visit the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">NHS Inform website</a>, or for non-clinical advice call 0800 028 2816. In the event that you need assistance in arranging transport to a testing site, you should contact either Accommodation Services or Security for assistance. </p>\n<p>Remember to stay at home or in your University accommodation if anyone in your household has symptoms of COVID-19. If you are self-isolating, have symptoms of coronavirus, or have coronavirus, you also need to: (1) tell Security (0131 474 0000 ext. 2222) - and also Accommodation Services (0131 474 0000 x 4902) if you live on campus; (2) Contact the School Office (schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk).

It’s worth emphasising that, if you are self-isolating, you need to remain in your term-time residence rather than returning to your permanent home, given the risk of spreading the virus.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Other advice on reducing the spread of the virus </span></p>\n<p>On and around campus, all of us can help reduce the spread of the virus by wearing face coverings when moving around the campus and on public transport, by following <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9hCY-MldMA&amp;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9hCY-MldMA&amp;feature=emb_title\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">good handwashing practice</a>, and by observing the rules on social distancing and those relating to social gatherings. </p>\n<p>If you need to self-isolate, you must do so immediately, for the full period*, staying at home (and in your own room as much as possible). It can be difficult to remember all of the detail on how and when to self-isolate, but you can easily look it up on the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/test-and-protect\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/test-and-protect\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">Test and Protect website</a>. If you do need to self-isolate, we will support you, and if you live on campus, we will help you access food and medicine. We will also ensure that you can keep up with your studies. If you are self-isolating, you should stay put, of course, rather than returning to your parental home potentially spreading the virus further.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for your support at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>*Footnote</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All positive cases need to isolate for 10 days from symptom onset date.</li>\n<li>All household members/flatmates need to isolate for 14 days from the symptom start date of the first symptomatic case.</li>\n<li>If any exposed household member/flatmates then subsequently become positive then they need to isolate for 10 days from their symptom start date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">For Staff </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Government action to drive down infection rates </span></p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the First Minister announced <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/new-measures-to-drive-down-infection-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/new-measures-to-drive-down-infection-rate/\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">new measures to drive down infection rates</a>. The two key points were a 10pm closing time for hospitality settings and a requirement that we do not meet people from any other households in our homes.</p>\n<p>In the First Minister’s announcement, there was also a continued emphasis on working from home where possible. This announcement does not change the current pattern of working for any QMU staff.</p>\n<p>The senior leadership team is very proud of the responsible way in which QMU students are acting in relation to COVID restrictions. Whilst we appreciate that there is concern in the community about the return to university and college campuses, we are keen to emphasise and nurture the socially responsible attitude of our students, and to promote a multi-generational, partnership approach to tacking the virus, avoiding blame. We are also grateful for the role that staff colleagues are playing in getting these messages through to students.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Looking ahead to next semester</span></p>\n<p>While there have been some initial challenges, the delivery of teaching and student support services this semester has been running very smoothly, thanks to your great efforts.</p>\n<p>As some of you will be aware from yesterday’s message regarding the timetable, in response to the latest government guidance and scientific advice we are now planning on maintaining a blended learning approach for semester 2. The Schools are beginning to look at some of the detail of this, but colleagues can assume that the same broad framework for adaptations that applied this semester will continue to apply in semester 2. This will include delivering the majority of lecture material online and designing assessments in a manner that ensures adherence to social distancing requirements, effectively again ruling out examinations with large cohorts of students that require physical co-presence. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Business recovery planning</span></p>\n<p>Now that most of the work of the business recovery work streams has been incorporated into normal business, we have paused meetings, with the exception of the Academic Delivery work stream. Recovery planning will now be managed through discussion at our twice weekly Business Continuity Group meetings, along with regular brief Senior Leadership Team catch ups on business continuity and business recovery.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">COVID incident management</span></p>\n<p>As you will know from earlier communications, we have had our first confirmed student COVID case at the University. As I said in my message on the subject, you can rest assured that the University has a robust approach in place to monitor and mitigate the impact of coronavirus, that the campus remains open for business as usual, and that the student and their close contacts are being supported. </p>\n<p>We are working in partnership with NHS Lothian’s Health Protection Team in handling this incident, and they are guiding us on communication and next steps, in accordance with our <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/f1cfc0dcfb5f4dbb8b2875046b046cb1}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"COVID-19 Incident Management Plan\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">incident management plan</a>. </p>\n<p>As for other universities, there appears to have been no evidence that the incident is linked to in-person teaching, which takes place in a very tightly controlled environment. So far, the tracing process suggests that, just as with the wider population, transmission at universities is occurring in domestic settings. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">More guidance on self-isolation and what to do if you have coronavirus symptoms </span></p>\n<p>Unless you have been contacted by <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/test-and-protect\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/test-and-protect\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">Test and Protect</a>, you should continue to attend campus as normal. </p>\n<p>If you need to book a COVID-19 test because you have developed symptoms (high temperature, a new continuous cough and/or a loss or change in sense of smell or taste) please visit the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">NHS Inform website</a> or for non-clinical advice call 0800 028 2816. </p>\n<p>Remember to stay at home if anyone in your household has symptoms of COVID-19.

If you have not been able to attend, you might like to note that we will shortly make available recordings of these talks on the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a0f618c6732c488dac61072f7ee9aa8a}\" title=\"Induction for New Students\" data-udi=\"umb://document/2dd5bdb89ceb47509ad60f4f85d16059\">Induction website.</a> Responses to the various questions from students that have come up during the talks will be made available on the same site, including those that we were unable to answer during the session itself. We will contact you to let you know when these responses are available, with a reminder of the link.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a new or a returning student, you may be feeling some anxiety as well as excitement at the start of the new semester. This is perfectly normal, even when things are normal. As the Principal said in his video welcome, do draw on the support services around you as and when you need them, from your PAT to the wellbeing service and including the Students’ Union as well as University <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a33d92be97574482967def19ff8a302f}\" title=\"Student Services\" data-udi=\"umb://document/3a3d373946d84e3983c90f09614c2dc6\">student services</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">New rules on the number of people who can gather together</span></p>\n<p>As we all settle in to the new semester, it has been heartening to witness on campus how careful everyone is being to follow the rules about physical distancing, wearing of face coverings, hygiene etc. Thank you. As you meet and greet friends across campus, do remember the Scottish Government’s announcement that, as of last Monday,<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/maximum-gathering-set-at-six-people-from-two-households\" target=\"_blank\"> the number of people who can gather together, indoors or outdoors, is limited to two households and a maximum of six people in total</a>.</p>\n<p>For student households (on or off campus) the ‘rule of six’ means that a maximum of six people can be in in your flat at any one time, including you and your flatmates. While I really do appreciate how hard it is, I know you will understand how important it is that we all stick to this rule to help protect others.</p>\n<p>Do remember that, even with the ‘rule of six’, you can still make use of our main atrium space so long as you remain socially distanced (at 1m+, as this is designated as a hospitality space), and we very much encourage you to do so. We have re-arranged seating to focus on small groupings and Starbucks is now open until 10pm at night from Monday to Friday each week. You might also like to note that we serve breakfast in 1875 (at the bottom of the stairs in the main atrium) from 8.30am on weekdays.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Protect Scotland app</span></p>\n<p>I know that students and staff across QMU are very community spirited, and I know that many of you will have already downloaded the Scottish Government’s new tracing app, Protect Scotland. This is available from Apple’s App Store and Google Play. I have it installed on my phone, and it’s quite straightforward to do.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">IT resources</span></p>\n<p>When you are using laptops and other devices in classes on campus, please endeavour to bring them into the classroom fully charged. We ask this as there are health and safety risks associated with opening the floor boxes that house power points in classrooms, and with trailing cables. In any case, there are a limited number of power points in each space. Power points are available for use elsewhere on campus (e.g. in the LRC and Maggie's Bar and Cafe.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Parking on campus</span></p>\n<p>While we settle into the semester, our Campus Services team are monitoring car park use. During this time, there will be no charges for parking, and this will remain the case until after the middle of October as we assess demand for use and patterns of use. We hope that you find this helpful.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Two important reminders</span></p>\n<p>With apologies for the repetition, I will reiterate two important messages from last week’s COVID update:</p>\n<p>1. Stay at home if you have COVID symptoms. Not sure if you have COVID or a cold?

If you haven’t done so already, please do so, via the Student Portal. Your support really is appreciated.</p>\n<p>And a small thank you gift</p>\n<p>I will also remind you that as a thank you for your contribution to keeping us all safe, the University is providing students with a free reusable face covering. These are available on a first come first served basis and can be obtained from a range of locations in and around our campus. Students living on campus will have been handed one on arrival. These face coverings are also available from the reception at Student Services, and (in smaller quantities) at Maggie's and the Tent.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">For Staff</span></p>\n<p>We are now in the first week of teaching for the majority of programmes, with a successful induction week behind us.

A very warm welcome to everyone starting their journey with us. On behalf of the Senior Leadership Team, I wish you every success and personal fulfilment.</p>\n<p><strong>Three things to remember</strong></p>\n<p>We know that those of you on campus will want to do your very best to stick to the safety guidelines that we have given you, to help avoid further COVID-related disruption to your lives, and to protect your health and that of your loved ones. If you need a reminder of the key things to remember, see our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xlQ_Od19l8\">short video</a>.</p>\n<p>In particular, please remember:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stay at home if you have COVID symptoms. Not sure if you have COVID or a cold? The Scottish Government has provided a useful <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/common-cold-and-covid-19-symptoms-advice-for-parents-and-carers/\">checklist</a>.</li>\n<li>If you are self-isolating, or suspect you have COVID, or are diagnosed with COVID, tell Security on 0131 474 0000 ext 2222) (and Accommodation reception if you live on campus – 0131 474 0000 ext 4902), then complete the normal absence form on the Student Portal and inform your Programme Leader by email.</li>\n<li>Stick to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-what-you-can-and-cannot-do/pages/overview/\">Scottish Government rules</a> on social gatherings, whether you live on or off campus. (Currently, the rules are that up to 8 people from a maximum of 3 households can meet indoors and up to 15 people from a maximum of 5 households can meet outdoors. This means that in halls of residence there should be no more than 8 people in any flat at any one time - this number includes you and your flatmates and a maximum of 2 other households.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Protecting the more vulnerable in our communities</strong></p>\n<p>I’ll also draw your attention to a message to students from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheScottishGovernment/videos/3740656755984986\">First Minister</a>. Across Scotland, people are very keen to ensure that the return to campus goes well. Each of us has our part to play in that, by following the rules. We know it’s hard, particularly if you are young and healthy, but by doing the right thing, each and every one of us can help reduce the risk to our vulnerable family members, older staff and students, and those with underlying health conditions.</p>\n<p>And as each of us learns the rules of the ‘new normal’, it is perfectly acceptable - and right - for you to encourage your friends to follow the one way systems, use the sanitiser stations and to follow the rules on meeting in groups.</p>\n<p>As part of our role in protecting you, we have prepared a robust <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/f1cfc0dcfb5f4dbb8b2875046b046cb1}\" title=\"COVID-19 Incident Management Plan\">COVID-19 incident management plan</a> for implementation in the event of any outbreak. As you might expect, this plan has been based on guidance from Health Protection Scotland.</p>\n<p><strong>A small thank you </strong></p>\n<p>As a thank you for your contribution to keeping us all safe, the University is providing students with a free reusable face covering. These are available on a first come first served basis and can be obtained from a range of locations in and around our campus. Students living on campus are being handed one on arrival. These face coverings are also available from the reception at Student Services, and (in smaller quantities) at Maggie's and the Tent.</p>\n<p><strong>Your timetable and on campus sessions</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, we appreciate that the timetable for this semester looks a bit different from previous years, with the majority of student timetables including ‘On-Campus Sessions’.  On-Campus sessions are primarily the standard learning and teaching activities you would expect on your programme (e.g. seminars, workshops, discussion groups etc.) though they can, at times, include other forms of learning and pastoral support.</p>\n<p>For this semester we have timetabled our on-campus learning and teaching activity by programme rather than by module, with that activity scheduled into two to four hour blocks rather than the usual one to two hour individual sessions. One consequence of that is that the activity taking place within a block, which will often involve a number of different staff, is difficult to specify on the timetable because that activity may vary across any one block.  It is also why module codes are not shown on your timetable for on-campus sessions. Rest assured that these sessions are nonetheless a key part of your programme which you are expected to attend*. This different approach to the timetable is to facilitate adherence to COVID-19 health and safety guidelines (in terms of occupancy management, frequent cleaning of rooms and physical distancing).</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support. It really is appreciated.</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>\n<p>*While these sessions take place on campus in the room indicated on your timetable, those students who need to study remotely can join these sessions via the University’s virtual learning environment (Blackboard-Collaborate) unless advised of alternative arrangements by your programme leader.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">9 September 2020</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">For staff</span></p>\n<p>Dear colleagues</p>\n<p>With induction week well underway, sincere thanks to all of you for your work in getting us to this point.   You might like to know that, at its meeting last week, the University Court praised the work of staff across the University for all their hard work in preparing for the return to campus.</p>\n<p><strong>Who to tell if you are self-isolating, or have coronavirus symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>As the numbers on campus increase, I will take this opportunity to remind you to tell Security, your line manager and the Head of HR (nmackie@qmu.ac.uk) if you are self-isolating or suspect you have coronavirus or are diagnosed with COVID.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that you should not come to campus if you have COVID symptoms, but with the cold season now upon us it can be hard to differentiate between the common cold and COVID. If you find yourself in this position, you will find the Scottish Government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/common-cold-and-covid-19-symptoms-advice-for-parents-and-carers/\">checklist</a> useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Our preparedness for any outbreak</strong></p>\n<p>From previous communications, you will know that work has been going on to ensure that we are well prepared for any local COVID outbreak. Our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/f1cfc0dcfb5f4dbb8b2875046b046cb1}?sourcedoc=%7b2F117ED4-DAFA-4D3F-85F7-E8DCD3123337%7d&amp;file=Covid%2019%20Incident%20Management%20Plan%20.pdf&amp;action=default\" title=\"COVID-19 Incident Management Plan\" data-anchor=\"?sourcedoc=%7b2F117ED4-DAFA-4D3F-85F7-E8DCD3123337%7d&amp;file=Covid%2019%20Incident%20Management%20Plan%20.pdf&amp;action=default\">COVID-19 incident management plan</a> is complete and ready for implementation whenever necessary. This plan has been based on guidance from Health Protection Scotland.</p>\n<p><strong>Answering your questions </strong></p>\n<p>With many of you returning to work on campus, we expect that you will have an increasing number of questions about our COVID-related plans and procedures. Given this, we have just issued a checklist of <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/news/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1540\">10 useful things to know</a>. Beyond that, the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/dfe7ffd43654452ba70403e5181a48db}\" title=\"Staff\">staff FAQs</a> on the website are the best first stop if you have a question, along with the associated COVID intranet site. If you can’t find the answer to your question, do ask your line manager, who in turn, should flag up any gaps to their Senior Leadership Team member, so that we can address them in our FAQs.</p>\n<p>One question area that is cropping up quite a lot is access to office space (see <a href=\"/coronavirus/faqs/staff/\">FAQ</a> on that topic) and guidance for staff using the office spaces. We have prepared a guide to <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/SiteAssets/SitePages/Campus%20Induction/COVID%20Office%20Working%20Guidance.pdf\">office working</a>, which you can access on the COVID intranet site and via the staff FAQS. Please note that, while regular cleaning of the office spaces continues to take place, in the current circumstances you need to clean your own desk before use. You will find cleaning wipes at tea points, and staff who hot-desk will be given their own pack of wipes on request to Assist. As you know, wherever possible you should continue to work from home rather than use the office spaces. (Academic staff can of course access the office spaces when they are on campus to deliver learning and teaching activity).</p>\n<p>Last week, you will have seen the guidance issued on <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/_layouts/15/WopiFrame2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bA5CBB250-818F-4254-842E-8C04E5D4771F%7d&amp;file=Guidance%20note%20on%20emails%20and%20arranging%20meetings.docx&amp;action=default)\">approaches to emails and meetings to minimise their negative impact on staff time</a>. We encourage you to discuss the guidance within your teams. This guidance arose partly out of findings from the recent survey on staff wellbeing. We have now published <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/SitePages/Staff%20Wellbeing.aspx\">a report on the survey outcomes</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Support with using Blackboard Collaborate across teaching rooms</strong></p>\n<p>Also last week, you will have seen that you can now access a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gM_gvNxwcyU\"></a><a href=\"/study-here/learning-facilities/it-services/learning-and-technologies/maintaining-module-continuity/guidelines/\"></a> </p>\n<p><strong>Final words on health and safety</strong></p>\n<p>You might also like to know that Mike Kennedy, our Health and Safety Adviser, has attended a trade union meeting this week to answer member questions on our campus adaptations and other work to protect staff and students from COVID.</p>\n<p>And as each of us learns the rules of the ‘new normal’, it is perfectly acceptable - and right - for you to encourage your colleagues and students to follow the new procedures. One hot spot has been catering outlets, where we have seen groups gathering. Please do bear in mind the rules about gathering in these spaces. See our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/84daaed5f3d04cd09566859f91fb8d90}\" title=\"Applicants\">Campus Life and Catering</a> webpage for more information.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued support at this very busy time.</p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm G.

Thank you for your support with this, which will do so much to help the whole QMU community.</p>\n<p>In the PowerPoint, you will find links to further information. When you arrive on campus, you’ll find guidance on display screens to support our safety measures, with additional safety guidance being installed within individual rooms.

This might mean some changes to your currently published timetable over the next few weeks, and so we would ask you to check your timetable regularly via the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://u.qmu.ac.uk/live/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"QMU Portal\">Portal</a> or the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/37658394b3744334ae51c98cc5e7b88b}\" title=\"MyQMU Mobile Application\" data-udi=\"umb://document/37658394b3744334ae51c98cc5e7b88b\">App</a> and before you set out to the campus for any classes. Indeed, in general, it is always a good idea to check your timetable before leaving home in case of any unavoidable late changes (eg due to unexpected staff absence through illness).</p>\n<p>Preparation of the semester two timetable will also be impacted by the increased student numbers. We plan to publish our Semester 2 timetable by 9th December.</p>\n<p>Of course, the situation with amended school exam results is just one of many unusual events arising out of coronavirus. We know that the pandemic has affected each and every one of you in different ways over the last few months. We hope that you are looking forward to returning to University, or to joining us for the first time.</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to welcoming all of you back on campus.</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt<br />Director of Operations and Finance</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>For staff</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues</p>\n<p>Safety on campus: information provided to students</p>\n<p>As we prepare to welcome the bulk of our new and returning students over the next couple of weeks, you might like to see <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xlQ_Od19l8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"QMU Youtube Channel\" data-anchor=\"?v=-xlQ_Od19l8\">a simple video</a> that we have prepared for them, setting out succinctly the key things they need to know to keep us all safe.</p>\n<p>In addition students will soon receive a PowerPoint presentation with a more detailed induction, very similar to the one that staff received. Students are also being required to sign the QMU Community Responsibility Agreement.

Trade union representatives observed the exercise, which went well. Other Edinburgh institutions have run their own desktop exercises and we are liaising with them, and City of Edinburgh Council, to share good practice, insights and experiences.</p>\n<p>Alongside all this, the Scottish Government has issued further COVID-related guidance for universities. We are, of course, checking our plans against the detail of the new guidance, but are confident that our approach is well aligned. In addition, the Scottish Government has confirmed that universities will receive additional funding where they have ended up overall with additional student numbers as a result of the revised SQA grades.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Timetabling updates</span></p>\n<p>I should also point out that the changes to the SQA and A Level results have necessitated a few late adjustments to the academic timetable to accommodate additional student numbers on various programmes.

The information has also been emailed directly to line managers. Designed to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of staff as they return to work on campus, our documents and processes take full account of Scottish Government guidance.</li>\n<li>We will soon be issuing risk assessment documentation associated with offices, to supplement the overarching institutional assessment and the individual risk</li>\n<li>assessments that are already published on the intranet. This will be used in conjunction with the Manager’s Return to Campus Checklist mentioned above. We are also producing posters and leaflets for office areas, which contain COVID-related guidance.</li>\n<li>We will also shortly be issuing additional information for staff on a safe return to campus. This will include practical information on matters such as travel to campus, campus capacity, campus adaptations, catering facilities and the use of face coverings. All members of staff will require to familiarise themselves with this information, and to confirm that they have done so, prior to returning to campus for the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some updates from IT:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The team (including Media Services) are currently working on video guides on the use of Collaborate and other tools within classroom spaces. In light of COVID, a support model is also being developed that protects both the IT team and the colleague requesting support. Until further notice, the default will be remote support as at present. More information will follow.</li>\n<li>Thank you again to everyone who has completed online training on how to undertake online teaching.

I summarise our progress below.</p>\n<p><strong>Current situation (phase 2</strong><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/513ad49bbf3740ce9584ff3b5ab52981}\" title=\"Qm Route Map Simple Version 2021 V09 220721\"><strong>​</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are currently in phase 2 of our route map, which focuses on preparing for phase 3 (semester start). Phase 2 enables priority and essential activity to take place on campus, with the default position being home working for staff where this is possible.</li>\n<li>With consent, staff can access the campus to pick up belongings or equipment, or if they cannot work from home effectively. Details on how to request access to the campus and request equipment are available on the <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/SitePages/QMU%20Route%20Map.aspx\">intranet</a>.</li>\n<li>The outdoor campus spaces and outdoor gym are open.</li>\n<li>In addition to the café facilities in the Students’ Union, Starbucks is open to those authorised to enter the campus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From Monday 17 August (continuation of phase 2)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staff offices will be open, but with limited capacity to allow for physical distancing. Access to the offices will be controlled via staff card (ie no need to complete the campus access form).  As physical distancing limits us to 50% occupancy, please coordinate with colleagues in your area if you plan to access the staff offices. Working from home remains the default.</li>\n<li>The Learning Resource Centre will be open to students from 9am-2pm, with access by student access card. No booking is required, but if you have any specific requirements please contact the LRC staff in advance (at <a href=\"mailto:LRCHelp@qmu.ac.uk\">LRCHelp@qmu.ac.uk</a>.)</li>\n<li>Staff meetings with up to nine participants can take place (in a limited range of rooms). Such meetings must be pre-booked using the standard ad-hoc booking system found on the <a href=\"http://timetable.qmu.ac.uk/celcatlive/\">intranet</a>. More information on this will be circulated via Moderator over the next few days.</li>\n<li>Doctoral vivas can take place and essential visitors are permitted, provided they are booked in using <a href=\"http://apps.qmu.ac.uk/vms/\">standard visitor management process</a> (intranet link)</li>\n<li>While it will be possible to arrange meetings involving more than nine people if they are dispersed across more than one room and linked by video conference, you will need to check with Media Services that this is achievable in your case. Please be mindful that the ITS and Media Services team need good notice of your request given the likely volume of requests and competition for video conferencing resources right now. Staff will receive an email with more information on this soon.</li>\n<li>Research activities with external participants can resume, provided there are no more than nine people in the room and that a risk assessment has been completed. Information on the risk assessment process is available.</li>\n<li>Staff tea points will be available, with limitations on use.</li>\n<li>Signage on campus will indicated which toilets are open, and will be updated as provision expands when the number of people on campus increases.</li>\n<li>Accommodation for international students who need to quarantine will be available from 20 August.</li>\n<li>The Helpdesk (Assist) will be physically staffed from 10am to 2pm on weekdays. Remote service through email will continue be available from 8am to 7pm on weekdays. (Student queries via <a href=\"mailto:LRCHelp@qmu.ac.uk\">LRCHelp@qmu.ac.uk</a> and all other queries <a href=\"mailto:Assist@qmu.ac.uk\">Assist@qmu.ac.uk</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From Monday 24 August (continuation of phase 2)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teaching starts for our PGDE (Home Economics) students. We very much look forward to welcoming these students on campus.</li>\n<li>Staff meetings with more than nine participants can take place (limited by updated - ie reduced - room capacities, defined in turn by requirements for physical distancing). Advance booking is still required, via the standard ad-hoc booking system found on the <a href=\"http://timetable.qmu.ac.uk/celcatlive/\">intranet</a>.</li>\n<li>There can be more than nine people involved in research activities on campus involving external participants, provided that a risk assessment has been completed. Information on the risk assessment process is available on the intranet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From Monday 7 September (our phase 3)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student residences will be open (open from Friday 4 September, and earlier for international students in quarantine)</li>\n<li>Student induction begins, with welcome and RES:LIFE activities.</li>\n<li>The Learning Resource Centre will be open from 8am to 9pm every day. The tiered area of the main atrium, with study spaces, will be open 24 hours a day, with vending facilities available. Access will be via student card, ie no booking required.</li>\n<li>All Student Services will be fully operational, with adaptations where necessary. As appropriate, students will be able to make bookings for face to face appointments.</li>\n<li>Outdoor sport is permitted, so long as it is organised by the Sports team or Students’ Union</li>\n<li>Students’ Union staff will be present on campus.</li>\n<li>Academic and professional services staff, who operate in student facing roles or whose presence is required on campus, will be expected to be on campus from the start of the semester on the days when their presence is required. Those whose role does not involve any face-to-face contact with students and are able to carry out their role remotely are expected to continue to work from home until the Scottish Government moves to phase 4 of its route map.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From Monday 14 September</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teaching starts (including on campus teaching).</li>\n<li>Subject to Scottish Government guidelines, we anticipate that indoor sports and indoor entertainment will resume.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staff can find more details of the plan on the <a href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=/services/campus-commercial-services/covid19/Shared%20Documents/QMU%20Routemap%20-%20Associated%20Documents&amp;FolderCTID=0x012000C1132186DEE92D428CC43D5EFC1B31AF&amp;View=%7bC5D58E02-C7DC-4218-9499-9D2BC222F8D7%7d\">intranet.</a></p>\n<p>As you will appreciate, all steps taken will be subject to any changes in Scottish Government guidance.</p>\n<p><strong>Our approach to face coverings on campus</strong></p>\n<p>The University expects everyone to wear a face covering when moving around the campus and when physical distancing is not possible. This is in line with current Scottish Government advice that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces where physical distancing is difficult and you might come into close contact with a lot of people.  The Scottish Government has also confirmed that the use of face coverings will be mandatory in university libraries and reading rooms, and it will issue more detailed guidance on this point in the next few days. We respect the rights of those who cannot wear face coverings for medical reasons. Face coverings will <strong>not</strong> be required in classes, unless physical distancing is compromised for some reason. Some staff may opt to wear face visors or face coverings when teaching.</p>\n<p><strong>Other updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember that 16 August (Sunday) is the deadline for submissions to the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/ea310fa3b8c8490c973226b99dd3fbd6}\" title=\"Stories of COVID\">Stories of COVID</a> Open to all students and staff, this project aims to collect QMU student and staff experiences of living through the pandemic, and to create a legacy of stories. No story is too small!</li>\n<li>We know that staff have been seeking guidance on do’s and don’ts for when they are on campus. We are working on an Office Guide and Learning and Teaching Guide, both of which will be provided to you before you access the campus. We also plan to have posters with advice located across campus. </li>\n<li>Feedback has been positive on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-college-university-and-purpose-built-student-accommodation/\">new COVID intranet microsite</a> for staff.</li>\n<li>Thank you to all staff who completed the Wellbeing Survey. We look forward to sharing the results with you in due course.</li>\n<li>Conscious of the recent local of localised COVID outbreaks, particularly in Aberdeen, we can reassure you that we have been planning, and continue to plan, for any local outbreak, liaising with Health Protection Scotland, other Edinburgh institutions and council officials. This will help mitigate the impact of any local outbreak on our campus operations and University life, helping us to ensure that we can consistently provide our students with the education and support that they need and deserve.</li>\n<li>Following the recent survey, the four UK funding bodies have agreed the proposed revisions to the REF timetable and guidance. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ref.ac.uk/news/ref-2021-resumes-with-additional-guidance-on-covid-revisions\" target=\"_blank\">They have also provided preliminary advice on putting in place contingency arrangements for REF submission preparation. </a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of us involved in planning for the new semester feel very pleased at the progress noted above, and look forward to witnessing the re-awakening on campus. My sincere thanks go to colleagues who are working so hard to make all of this happen in a safe and orderly manner.</p>\n<p>Malcolm G Cutt</p>\n<p>Director of Operations and Finance</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

In addition, the Scottish Government has decided to retain 2 metres as the default physical distancing requirement for Phase 3, but will introduce exceptions to this requirement for specific sectors and settings if practicable mitigating measures can be implemented. There will, however, be no exemptions prior to the move to Phase 3. None of the new announcements change the University’s current route map or detailed plans, though we will remain flexible as Scottish Government guidance changes.</p>\n<p>The Scottish Government has also released <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-universities/\" target=\"_blank\">specific guidance for universities on re-opening</a>. Reassuringly, our plans are well aligned with this guidance, in particular the section on health and safety.</p>\n<p>Last week we launched an <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7xQ9OinrPk\" target=\"_blank\" data-anchor=\"?v=I7xQ9OinrPk\">animated video</a> setting out some of the steps we are taking to ensure a safe and positive experience for all when the campus re-opens. We followed this up with further information for staff on planning for re-opening. Staff can find that important message on the intranet. (Do remember you need to be logged onto the QM Desktop to access the intranet).</p>\n<p>We hope that you are finding the information that we are providing useful. As you know, we are not yet able to answer every detailed question that you might have about our plans, but we are committed to providing information as soon as we have it.

Much of the work at the moment is focused on early occupation of the campus, along with preparation for semester one, including staff and student wellbeing and ensuring the optimum student experience within the required constraints.</p>\n<p>As actions from the research and innovation work stream are now being taken forward via groups across the University, meetings of that work stream have been paused, with a view to reconvening later in the summer if required. Similarly, now that Court has approved the 2020/21 budget, the financial implications work stream does not have any additional meetings planned at this point. Work on refining financial plans will continue through the usual channels and the work stream will reconvene if required.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Staff Wellbeing</span></p>\n<p>The Senior Leadership Team is conscious of the current pressure on staff and its impact on staff anxiety and workloads, and we are looking into what steps we can take to help ease the pressure. A separate message will be issued shortly to staff, which will provide more information on this.</p>\n<p>We also appreciate that some of you are buying items such as stationery and other consumables for use in connection with working at home. Please remember that any reasonable incidental costs you incur in undertaking University business may be reclaimed through the normal staff expenses procedure, with the authorisation of your line manager.</p>\n<p>Now that we are in July, I know that many of you will soon be taking a very well earned summer break. If you feel that you can’t take leave because of your workload, please discuss this with your line manager. On behalf of the Senior Leadership Team, when you do take leave I encourage you to switch off from work fully during your time off.</p>"

You can find details <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/further-route-map-detail-announced\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a> In addition, the Deputy First Minister announced last week the intention that <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/return-to-full-time-schooling\" target=\"_blank\">schools will return full-time in August,</a> a move that I am sure will come as a big relief to all of you who are parents to school age children.</p>\n<p>The Scottish Government has also advised that students can retrieve belongings that they have left in student accommodation, with effect from 29 June. If you have any queries about this, please contact Accommodation Services.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Preparing for the next semester</span></p>\n<p>Here at QMU, and in line with the Scottish Government route map, we have been undertaking essential preparatory work to allow us to move into phase 2 of our own route map.</p>\n<p>We have finalised our COVID-19 risk assessment, and it was approved by our Health and Safety Committee last week. We will share this document with you as soon as possible. This risk assessment is a key enabler, not just for phase 2 but for the re-opening of the campus.</p>\n<p>As set out in our last update, the default position remains staff working from home, but from Monday 29 June (ie yesterday) they are permitted to attend the campus to retrieve essential materials, subject to approval processes. During the course of this week we will issue further guidance on how staff can request campus access. In addition, certain high priority works can resume, although the activity in this category is very limited and subject to completion of an appropriate risk assessment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Continuing to address your questions</span></p>\n<p>We will continue to address common questions as soon as we can, the limitation being the evolving situation and the pace of the Scottish Government’s move out of lockdown. One such question relates to use of the Learning Resource Centre (LRC). The answer is that, while it will not be in use until the start of the semester, it remains accessible remotely.</p>\n<p>A range of preparations is being made for next semester. Our timetable is central to this work. It is key to managing the numbers of students and staff attending campus at any one time, and coordinating travel, access and circulation for these numbers as well as the learning and teaching that takes place over the course of the day. We are monitoring external guidance as it is updated and will continue to ensure that our own plans adapt as appropriate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Supporting your mental health</span></p>\n<p>In previous updates, we have acknowledged the anxiety felt by staff and students at this time, arising for a whole range of reasons. In the next few days, look out for information on ‘The Big White Wall’. This is an online resource to support our student and staff community with mental health and wellbeing. We have subscribed to this service with funding from the National Lottery Young Start Fund as part of our much broader programme of work to support mental health and wellbeing at this time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Graduation</span></p>\n<p>In the last week, we announced our plans for graduation activities. While we deeply regret the need to cancel July’s ceremonies at the Usher Hall, we look forward to celebrating this important milestone on our website and social media, and to next year’s graduation celebration.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">IT training resources for staff</span></p>\n<p>Our ITS team has created a portal that links to <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://qmu.sharepoint.com/sites/O365CL\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft training resources</a> on how to use Office, OneDrive and Teams. </p>\n<p>We have received very positive feedback on the digital learning training being provided by the ITS team, and there is evidence of some great peer to peer learning too. Academic staff who have not yet had time to engage in this training are encouraged to take this opportunity.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">How we will welcome new students</span></p>\n<p>Just as everyone who reads this will be feeling for all the 2020 graduates whose graduation celebrations are affected by coronavirus, you may be wondering about our plan for welcoming new students in these unusual times. To give us more space for physically distanced activities, we have arranged for a marquee to be in place on campus at the start of the semester. Using that space and others, we will offer a full four-week ‘Welcome to QMU’ programme focused on fun and forming friendships. Our Students’ Union and RES:LIFE team will, as always, work closely together, and they will run these ‘Welcome to QMU’ events in full partnership. Within their planning, they are taking account of the needs of those students who won’t be on campus to benefit from opportunities for social interaction.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The role of higher education in COVID recovery</span></p>\n<p>I’ll end by mentioning the recommendations of the<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/working-towards-economic-recovery\" target=\"_blank\"> Scottish Government’s Advisory Group on Economic Recovery,</a> which were published last week. Encouragingly, the report proposes an education-led economy and argues that university and college funding should be protected.</p>\n<p> </p>"

With the exception of people shielding, you are now able to meet people from up to two other households outdoors, either together or separately. While these do not always have to be the same households, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making-scotlands-route-map-through-out-crisis-phase-2-update/\" target=\"_blank\">the advice</a> is that you should not meet more than two other households in one day. As in phase one, there should not be more than eight people in a group. Anyone living alone or only with children under 18 can form an ‘extended household group’ with one other household.</p>\n<p>From Monday, 29 June some indoor workplaces can re-open, including factories, labs and warehouses, subject to strict physical distancing, hygiene and health and safety guidance, but non-essential offices and call centres should remain closed. While the guidance allows a small number of university staff to return to university buildings to make essential preparations for re-opening in Phase 3, subject to adhered to public health measures, the default remains working remotely. Scottish Government guidelines state that these essential preparations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>preparation of buildings, the adjustment of teaching spaces, walkways and student accommodation as well as research facilities.</li>\n<li>provisions for specialist testing and services to support operations, including access for contractors.</li>\n<li>work onsite to prepare teaching materials, including digital content (e.g filming lab demonstrations) and arrangements for their delivery.</li>\n<li>allowing staff to access facilities to collect materials to support continued home working, eg. teaching and research materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that we are the process of conducting a full COVID-19 risk assessment in line with HSE guidance in consultation with our trade unions and we will not ask, and cannot permit anyone to return to the campus until, as far reasonable practical, it is safe to do so.</p>\n<p>We have updated our own route map for the return to campus based on this latest Scottish Government announcement and associated guidance. Alongside this, we have been expanding our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2d74bbbb94e34467ab39bb1f82a83b2e}\" title=\"Students\" data-udi=\"umb://document/3c2ab7fe838b4338838be25fb3cb3741\">coronavirus FAQs for students</a> and have produced a ‘top ten’ FAQs on the return to campus for staff, which you can find on the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/marketing/_layouts/15/WopiFrame2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b8EF79D08-9063-437C-A835-77D805EC862E%7d&amp;file=Return%20to%20Campus%20FAQs%20for%20staff%20for%20intranet.docx&amp;action=default\" target=\"_blank\" data-anchor=\"?sourcedoc=%7b8EF79D08-9063-437C-A835-77D805EC862E%7d&amp;file=Return%20to%20Campus%20FAQs%20for%20staff%20for%20intranet.docx&amp;action=default\">intranet</a> (remember you need to be using the QM desktop to access the intranet).

Rest assured that we are committed to providing answers to your questions as soon as we can, and that our plans for the next semester are progressing well.</p>\n<p>We appreciate too the range and depth of anxieties as we move towards our campus re-opening in September – for example worries associated with juggling caring responsibilities with teaching or studying. Our Business Recovery Wellbeing work stream is considering how to address your anxieties, and this topic also features greatly in senior leadership team discussion right now.</p>\n<p>Students’ Union survey on students’ experiences of the move to online learning and teaching</p>\n<p>Related to this, the Senior Leadership Team has found the Students’ Union’s survey on students' experiences of the move to online learning and teaching very helpful. Students reported enjoying the flexibility of being able to interact with recorded material in their own time and at their own pace. Challenges highlighted in the survey included: finding motivation and maintaining focus; issues associated with the home working environment, particularly in busy households or where students are trying to juggle caring and work responsibilities; and missing peer support. The results gave us an indication of how students have experienced the last part of the academic year and are already proving very useful in our work planning the delivery of learning and teaching and student support next semester. Thank you very much to everyone who completed the survey.</p>\n<p>Updated visa guidance from the UK Government</p>\n<p>Earlier last week, the UK Government issued <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892783/Tier_4_Guidance_-_Covid-19_response_200616.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Updated Guidance for Tier 4 Sponsors and Migrants and for Short-term Students.</a> This update confirms that new international students can commence their studies by distance learning for academic year 2020-21, provided they will transition to face-to-face learning as soon as possible. It also confirms that those studying by distance/blended learning will be eligible to apply for the Graduate (visa) route, provided they are in the UK by 6 April 2021. The update also provides information on the current availability of visa application centres, which now includes India and the USA, and also secure <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.vfsglobal.co.uk/en\" target=\"_blank\">English language test centres</a>.</p>\n<p>Other useful updates (primarily of interest to staff rather than students)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I will take this opportunity to remind staff of the guidance and support on teaching and learning in semester one that was issued by Moderator on 18 June.

Whilst we are not in a position to answer some of your more detailed questions yet, please be assured that we will share more information as soon as we can. We understand that you will be anxious to receive as much detail as possible and we are trying to address that as fast as we can, whilst making sure that our plans are aligned with guidance which continues to emerge from the Scottish Government. In the meantime, please rest assured that our planning for next semester is running smoothly.</p>\n<p>You might like to note that we have been able to update our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2d74bbbb94e34467ab39bb1f82a83b2e}\" title=\"Students\" data-udi=\"umb://document/3c2ab7fe838b4338838be25fb3cb3741\">student</a> and <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2f01fb73089c46019eb591a0e85a94a2}\" title=\"Applicants\" data-udi=\"umb://document/b5bb36d4fda2428e91f21e13e9059f0b\">applicant/offer holder</a> FAQs with some more information on studying online, in response to questions on that subject we received last week</p>\n<p>Another common question is when staff can start working again on campus. Whilst we cannot yet give specific information, we can confirm that, for the majority of staff, remote working is likely to be the default way of working for some time, with some exceptions.</p>\n<p>We would ask all students to use the coronavirus FAQs and updates (which are available on the website) as their first port of call for information before approaching members of staff, as this will help ensure that you receive the most accurate information. Where you do need to approach staff with a question, it would help hugely if you could approach one staff member at a time rather than contacting a number of them simultaneously. This will help to ensure that your question is dealt with in the most efficient way. As I have noted above, please be aware that there are some questions where we are not yet in a position to provide a substantive answer, but that we will undertake to provide an answer as soon as we can. Thank you for your support with this, which will help to ensure you get the right information, and that staff time is used in the best way possible.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Roadmap out of lockdown</span></p>\n<p>Next Thursday (18 June), the Scottish Government is expected to announce whether we can move into phase 2 of its route map out of lockdown. At QMU, we continue to develop our own detailed roadmap, which is aligned to the Scottish Government approach, and which is taking into account higher education sector-wide approaches and principles. We hope to be able to share this roadmap with staff over the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>There has been good progress in each of our Business Recovery Planning work streams. A brief summary of the current status is set out at the foot of this message.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Update on examination boards</span></p>\n<p>We know that students will be waiting anxiously for their exam results and we can confirm that examination board meetings have been running very smoothly. School Office staff have done a great job in adjusting and streamlining systems to reflect the move to online board meetings, and all indeed staff involved have adapted extremely well, in very challenging circumstances We think that the success in moving to online board meetings offers positive learning that we can take beyond the pandemic. On behalf of the Senior Leadership Team, I thank everyone involved in this year’s exam boards.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Engaging with prospective students when they cannot visit us in person</span></p>\n<p>You may have seen our new online hub ‘<a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/483b75de776b4f8abaaf139685141b54}\" title=\"Experience QMU\" data-udi=\"umb://document/7c887a94dbd84886a5f00d291525e0a8\">Experience QMU</a>’ , which is designed to give prospective students a flavour of what it like to study with us. We are confident that this hub will be really useful to prospective students and are very grateful to the staff and students involved in its creation. We encourage you to share the link to the hub with people who you think might be interested. This initiative is part of a much broader programme of work on engaging with prospective students at this time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Useful information for academic staff</span></p>\n<p>From previous updates, staff will already know about our IT team’s work on resources and support for remote teaching, assessment and student support in response to COVID-19. I would encourage colleagues to engage with these resources and the associated training which is available on how to get the most out of using them. You will find new information on this topic <a href=\"http://www.qmu.ac.uk/online-pivot\">here.</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Recovery Planning Work Streams: current status</span></p>\n<p>See below for a brief update on each of the Business Recovery Work Streams. If you need any further information, please speak to the relevant convener.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Academic Calendar &amp; Timetable Work Stream (convened by June Ross)</span></p>\n<p>Dates have now been set for the start of semester one – and announced - and it has been agreed which programmes are moving their start date to semester two. The thinking is therefore that the Academic Calendar and Timetable work stream should now amalgamate with the Approach to Academic Delivery and Assessment work stream to allow for more integrated discussion.</p>\n<p>The Transition &amp; Induction Working Group will be able to take forward some of the planning for the start of session now that the high-level parameters have been set.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Campus Adaptions Work Stream convened by Bruce Laing)</span></p>\n<p>This work stream is coordinating a wide range of important work to allow for the successful resumption of the on-campus experience for students, and the creation of an adapted work environment for staff on site. There is a very large amount of pivotal work taking place in this area.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Student Experience Work Stream (co-convened by Yvonne Simpson and Chiara Menozzi)</span></p>\n<p>Work continues, in partnership between the University and the Students’ Union. This work stream is likely to remain in place longer than most, to help co-ordinate student support as students return to campus.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Approach to Academic Delivery &amp; Assessment Work Stream (convened by Dr Richard Butt)</span></p>\n<p>While this work stream will continue for the time being, it is likely that its high level planning work will shortly be complete. The development of programme level adjustments will continue in the schools, as will the work of the IT team and the Transition and Induction Working Group. The focus of the work stream is now concentrated on supporting the work of the Schools and programme leaders.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Research and Innovation Work Stream (convened by Prof Brigid Daniel)</span></p>\n<p>The work stream has held two well attended meetings and staff have gathered a significant amount of pertinent information to help QMU shape its response to the challenges and opportunities driven by the current situation. The work stream has produced some useful ideas as to how best to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on both progressing existing research and for winning new work. Of particular early concern was the impact on both staff and budgets for research that was nearing completion of contracts. However, the view is now that these can largely be dealt with through existing working groups and business processes.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Staff Wellbeing Work Stream (convened by Angela Smith)</span></p>\n<p>This work stream is looking at supporting both those staff who are returning to campus and those who will continue to work from home for the time being. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Financial Implications Work Stream (Malcolm Cutt)</span></p>\n<p>The work stream will need to carry on for the time being but will be absorbed into business as usual financial planning.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Student Recruitment (co-convened by Sarah Bailey and Jane Scott)</span></p>\n<p>The group has considered a number of actions to support both 2020/1 and 2021/2 recruitment cycles, supplementing activity already in place. The Recruitment and Admissions and Marketing &amp; Communications teams are implementing actions, including, for example Experience QMU, converting open days to online events, and finding the best ways of engaging prospective students in the absence of face to face recruitment fairs.</p>\n<p> </p>"

While this means that some outdoor activity restrictions have now been eased, we are still urged to stay at home as much as possible and maintain strict physical distancing when outdoors. You can find out more about phase 1 rules at <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/lockdown-begins-to-ease-in-phase-1\" target=\"_blank\">news.gov.scot</a>.</p>\n<p>We are making good progress through the various business recovery work-streams on establishing what each stage of the easing of lockdown means for operations at Queen Margaret University, and on planning the adaptations, we will make to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of staff and students when we return to the campus. We are working closely with the Universities Safety and Health Association (USHA), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), and the Scottish Government to implement a number of adjustments to our campus. Before restarting any work on campus, we will conduct a full COVID-19 risk assessment in line with HSE guidance, consult with our trade unions and communicate these results to the QMU community. We will not ask anyone to return to the campus until we can ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that it is safe to do so.</p>\n<p>Adjustments will include managing campus access, as well as monitoring occupancy levels and the circulation of students and staff in our buildings, to ensure that we continue to adhere to social distancing requirements. We will achieve this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limiting the occupancy of all University spaces at any one time.</li>\n<li>Staggering the start of timetabled sessions and lunch periods.</li>\n<li>Timetabling learning sessions in 2-3 hour blocks, all of which will be supported by a return to campus induction, clear signage and other supporting communications.</li>\n<li>Putting other robust hygiene measures in place, such as providing hand sanitisers at key locations throughout the campus.</li>\n<li>Further details of the actions we plan to take will be communicated to all staff and students as Scottish Government and public health advice, and our own subsequent business continuity planning develops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/A-set-of-high-level-principles-and-supporting-information-for-universities.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">We will also be closely following the principles for emerging from lockdown that have just been published by Universities UK and UCEA.</a> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Autumn semester start dates</span></p>\n<p>Importantly, and as we announced on Friday, we are now able to confirm that our autumn semester will start in September and that we are all set to welcome our new and returning students then. Our Induction Week will begin for most students as planned on 7 September, with teaching and learning starting on the 14th. There are a few exceptions, which you can find out more about in our applicant FAQs. We plan a mix of on-campus and online activity (commonly referred to as blended delivery) for semester 1. </p>\n<p>In our communications about next semester, we aim to emphasise that while COVID-19 has brought major disruption worldwide, the University’s role in the world remains unchanged. With our focus on addressing the issues facing society, through education and research, and our strong social justice ethos, we look forward to playing our part as society re-adjusts and re-calibrates beyond the pandemic. More immediately, we pride ourselves on the supportive community environment that we offer at QMU, in which everyone is treated as an individual. We are confident that this strength will serve our students well when they join or re-join us this autumn to make progress on their goals in their study, work and personal lives.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Engaging with prospective students</span></p>\n<p>As you will already know, we are maximising opportunities for prospective students to engage with us, for example through the Online Postgraduate Open Day which took place last Thursday. This event went very well, thanks to the excellent work of all those involved.</p>\n<p>Alongside this, we have been showcasing some of the excellent work going on across the University in recent months, including both that related to the pandemic and our work generally. One way we have been doing this is through publishing and promoting staff and student blogs<a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/5528842a4bf14d3bae28bd61d9b38685}\" title=\"Blogs\" data-udi=\"umb://document/5528842a4bf14d3bae28bd61d9b38685\">.</a></p>"

      "content": "<p>From our communications on coronavirus, you will know of our plan to start learning and teaching delivery in mid-September in line with the currently published academic calendar, with such delivery anticipated as being a mix of on-campus and online activity (commonly referred to as blended delivery). We can now provide more clarity and reassurance on our plans.</p>\n<p>In short, we can confirm that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Induction Week will begin on 7th September.</li>\n<li>Teaching and learning will start (with a few exceptions as set out at the foot of this message*) on 14th September.</li>\n<li>We will maximise opportunities for face to face delivery in support of the student experience.</li>\n<li>We will aim to publish the semester 1 timetable by no later than 21 August. The semester 2 timetable will be planned separately and published on a later date so as to be able to take into account any changes to current and planned restrictions.</li>\n<li>Lectures will be delivered online and asynchronously. What this means is that students can access online lectures at a time that suits them, rather than all students having to “attend” a lecture at the same time. As we will have to allow for social distancing on campus, the removal of lectures from the face to face timetable frees up space and time for the other elements of teaching, such as seminars and tutorials, where students gain more benefit from face to face interaction.</li>\n<li>The teaching day will be extended so that it runs from 9am to 8pm, though we will minimise the number of times any student or staff member is scheduled to be on campus in the evening.</li>\n<li>All new first year students will receive 6 hours on-campus teaching per week from the very start of their course, in two to three hour blocks across two to three days a week. All new (full-time) postgraduate students will receive 5 hours on-campus teaching from the very start of their courses, again delivered in two to three hour blocks across two days a week. If at any point in the semester Scottish Government health guidelines require it, this activity will be moved online for the required period. Level 2-4 students will also receive a combination of on-campus and online learning, the balance of which will vary according to programme requirements.</li>\n<li>The level of teaching of students in other years will be decided by the programme team, working within certain parameters.</li>\n<li>Students who are unable to join us from the beginning of the term (e.g. because of issues related to their visa or quarantine) will be able to begin their studies online.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our plans have been informed by the following principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protecting the health and safety and wellbeing of our students and staff.</li>\n<li>Enabling a fulfilling all-round student experience for all students. We are determined to ensure that students new to the University are provided with sufficient on-campus teaching to support their adjustment to a new learning environment, and that returning students also have sufficient time for their on-campus learning activities.</li>\n<li>Adhering to health protection advice from Government and other national bodies, e.g. in terms of social distancing, additional hygiene measures.</li>\n<li>Facilitating a fulfilling all-round student experience for new students from the very beginning of their time with us. We are taking into account the importance of new students having plenty of opportunities to engage with their peers from the very start of their course, enabling them to make friends and form support networks.</li>\n<li>Maximising the flexibility for programme teams in collegiately designing, distributing and delivering their learning and teaching activity within the required COVID-19 restrictions.</li>\n<li>No student or staff member will be timetabled to be on campus for more than 8 hours on any one day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this message focuses on taught programmes, please rest assured that we are, of course, planning for appropriate contact time and support for new and continuing PhD students. This important work is being led by our Graduate School team.</p>\n<p>We know that everyone will be very keen to return to a normal way of living and working as soon as possible, enabling them to make progress on their goals in their study, work and personal lives. We hope that the arrangements set out above reassure you that we will be able to offer a fulfilling student (and staff) experience from September, while ensuring that appropriate social distancing and broader health protection measures are in place.</p>\n<p>We pride ourselves on offering a supportive environment for our students at QMU, treating everyone as an individual. I am confident that this strength will serve our students well as we move into the new academic year.</p>\n<p>Dr Richard Butt<br />Deputy Principal</p>\n<p>* The exceptions to the 14th September start of teaching date are to the following programmes:</p>\n<p>1. New year 1 entrants <strong>PDGE Secondary (Home Economics)</strong> - Induction will begin on 24th August with teaching commencing on 7th September.</p>\n<p>2.

The first phase is due to begin tomorrow (Thursday) following the end-of-cycle review of the COVID-19 regulations due on that day, if the evidence supports that. During phase 1, people will be allowed to use public outdoor spaces for recreational purposes, for example to sit in a public space. In addition, one household could meet up with another household outdoors, in small numbers, including in gardens, but with physical distancing required.</p>\n<p>As certain conditions must be met before we move to phase 2 and beyond, no dates have been set for phases 2, 3 and 4 yet.</p>\n<p>Phase 1 will not involve any changes to University operations. Laboratory work can re-start from phase 2, and we will liaise with relevant staff on this, including contract researchers, in due course. Phase 3 allows for blended learning and teaching. Our representative body, Universities Scotland, is liaising with the Scottish Government to ascertain more precisely the implications of each phase for universities, but it appears that the assumptions of our business recovery work streams, which continue to work at pace, are in line with the Scottish Government’s thinking. Our Principal will also have the opportunity to discuss the implications with the Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science, at their next 121 meeting.</p>\n<p>It is abundantly clear to all the Senior Leadership Team that staff right across the University are doing an amazing job tackling business continuity and business recovery planning at the same time as getting their day to day work done. We recognise that pressure on staff is particularly acute at the moment as academic and professional services staff prepare for, and participate in, examination boards and review and validation events. Thank you again to you all.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">A couple of other points for staff:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ITS are planning further online training for staff across the summer period to support them with online teaching. Look out for a Moderator on the subject which will come out soon, covering both group and 121 training options. As you would expect, we are also considering and planning for students’ online learning training needs, particularly those of new students.</li>\n<li>We know very well that many staff are missing face to face interaction with colleagues at the moment, both from a professional and social perspective. We also know that, across the University, staff are creating opportunities to interact and socialise online with colleagues, through informal catch ups or online quizzes etc – which is wonderful. If you are arranging such online events and would be open to inviting colleagues more widely to join, do let us know so we can include your event in an online calendar of such events via QMU@Home. Please email <a href=\"mailto:mcraig@qmu.ac.uk\">Mary Craig</a> with the details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">For students and staff:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=168822901237821\" target=\"_blank\" data-anchor=\"?v=168822901237821\">Our Chancellor, Prue Leith is keen to show her support for the staff and student community at this time and has released another video message for us</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for your continued support and positivity.

At QMU, we have a small number of staff currently on furlough.</p>\n<p>Discussions continue between the Scottish Government, the SFC, and across the sector on support for higher education with the issues arising from COVID-19.

Current undergraduate students considering options after graduation are warmly invited to attend. In recognition of the challenging circumstances that the COVID-19 pandemic presents, the University is offering an additional 10% discount on postgraduate tuition fees to this year’s QMU graduates and alumni, on top of their existing 10% discount, when they apply before the end of July 2020 for a programme commencing in 2020/21.</p>\n<p>Senate met last week and discussed the University’s business recovery plan.

This day is intended to be used by staff to rest and switch off from work, which has, of course, been very intensive recently.

We anticipate that we will be able to provide accommodation for any students who wish to stay beyond their current occupancy end date, and may be able to assist students whose private rental accommodation is coming to an end and would like to move into our halls of residence (for further information contact <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:accommodation@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">accommodation@qmu.ac.uk</a>).</p>\n<p>We are also receiving enquiries from students who have already left accommodation and are wondering how and when they might be able to retrieve their belongings. If you are in this situation, please be assured that we will be in touch to clarify the process and the deadline for collecting your belongings when any changes are announced by the Scottish Government regarding the restrictions which currently prevent travel to campus. In order to protect you, other students and our staff, access to the accommodation will be restricted to enable social distancing and so please do not travel to campus until you have heard from us. Your belongings will remain secure within accommodation until restrictions have been lifted. In a very small number of cases the University may need to pack carefully and store securely your belongings should the room you occupied be needed to accommodate NHS staff/key workers, or to allow for essential maintenance programmes that have been planned in the summer months. There are no confirmed plans at present but we will provide advance notification to any affected students. We have written separately to any affected students covering all the points above, and more information is available in the accommodation section of our <a data-id=\"13962\" href=\"/{localLink:13962}\" title=\"FAQs\">coronavirus FAQs</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Business recovery planning</span></p>\n<p>Work on our Recovery Planning Group workstreams is moving at pace. We are planning to start learning and teaching delivery in mid-September in line with the currently published academic calendar, with such delivery anticipated as being a mix of online and on-campus activity (commonly referred to as blended delivery). The Recovery Group’s plans will allow for flexibility, and are focused firmly on ensuring the quality of the student experience and the wellbeing of staff and students. There is, of course, student and trade union representation on many of the workstream groups and planning is being informed by advice from government and public health bodies.

QMU has been awarded £92,242 in rapid coronavirus research funding from the Scottish Government following two successful bids from academic staff within the University. The University’s two research projects aim to inform current health protection practice and policy in the provision of quality care, in health service settings and the wider community, in the context of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Dr Alison Strang, a Senior Research Fellow at our Institute for Global Health and Development (IGHD), and Dr Olivia Sagan (Head of the Division of Psychology, Sociology and Education) will receive £64,098 towards their research into the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on loneliness amongst asylum seekers and refugees, while Dr Cathy Bulley from the University’s Physiotherapy area is leading an interdisciplinary team of researchers from the School of Health Sciences who have been granted £28,326 for work on supporting recovery from illness experienced in isolation due to a pandemic. Congratulations to them, and sincere thanks again to everyone involved in putting together our bids to the Scottish Government.</p>\n<p>Another example of the QMU community’s positive response to the pandemic is the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/qmu_racearoundtheworld/\" target=\"_blank\">'Race Around the World' </a>challenge hosted by the QMU Men's Rugby team in collaboration with all of the University's sports clubs and societies. Everyone in the QMU community is welcome to take part, with the aim of travelling 40,000km collectively (that's 34 cities across 30 different countries) within the month of May to raise at least £1500 for NHS Charities Together.

This announcement was largely focused on the English sector, and further clarity is needed on some of the details of the package from the perspective of the devolved nations.</p>\n<p>Alongside this, the Scottish Government’s Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science has written to principals of HE and FE principals in Scotland summarising Scottish Government support so far (much of which have been covered in Malcolm’s previous updates to staff and students) and referring to engagement with the UK Government.

What is clear from the document is that some degree of social distancing will be required for some time after the end of lockdown. There is specific mention of educational settings in the framework, and our Recovery Planning Group is taking this information into account.</p>\n<p>Alongside this, the Scottish Government’s Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science issued<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-higher-education-and-science---letter-from-the-minister-for-further-education-higher-education-and-science/\" target=\"_blank\"> a letter to all international students</a>, along with associated guidance.

This follows the decision, on 24 March 2020, to put the REF on hold while institutions respond to the impact of COVID-19 on their operations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To help inform this work, the REF team at Research England ran a <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://ref.ac.uk/guidance/training-and-events-materials/webinar-and-survey-initial-views-on-ref-timetable/\" target=\"_blank\">webinar</a> on 21 April, seeking initial views from the higher education sector on two central issues for the revised REF exercise:</p>\n<p><br />1) The timing of the new submission deadline.</p>\n<p>2) The broad approach to considering the effects on impact case studies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Views on these two issues will be gathered via a short survey, which is available on their website. The deadline for responses to the survey is noon, Tuesday 5 May, with the outcome due at the end of May. An institutional level response will be discussed at the REF Steering Group, but responses are also invited from any organisation, group or individual with an interest in the conduct, quality, funding or use of research.</p>\n<p><br /><span class=\"lead\">Furlough</span></p>\n<p>The University is employing the Government’s furlough scheme with a very small group of staff members, who are unable to do meaningful work at this point because of the lockdown situation. The Government will pay 80% of their salary, and QMU will make up the remaining 20%. We have contacted all staff affected personally to ensure that they understand that this is not a sign of job insecurity. In essence, furlough is simply a mechanism for the University to access government support legitimately.</p>\n<p><br /><span class=\"lead\">Reporting downtime or other IT issues via Assist</span></p>\n<p>While our IT systems are generally working very well for remote working, we know that some may have been experiencing intermittent issues. We continue to encourage students and staff to report any problems they may be experiencing to <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:assist@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Assist</a> so that the IT team is aware of these and can act on them as appropriate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Messages from the Principal for current and prospective students</span></p>\n<p>We hope that students saw the<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwrhiI6GM20&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\"> Principal’s video message</a> on social media last week to wish them all the best for their upcoming exams and to thank them for their resilience and courage while we navigate this new way of learning.

Alongside this, as part of a package of emergency financial support to help students facing hardship as a result of the current situation, the Scottish Government has awarded QMU an additional allocation of £47k. In line with guidance, this sum will be applied to our Discretionary Fund for students. Students who are facing hardship as a result of COVID-19 should apply to our Discretionary (hardship) and International Hardship funds in the usual way, through our Student Funding Adviser at <a href=\"mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a>. The Student Funding Adviser can provide you with advice as well as guidance on how to apply for these funds.</p>\n<p>QMU’s contribution to the national and local effort</p>\n<p>Over the last couple of weeks, researchers from across the University have worked together at pace to develop a portfolio of grant applications to the Chief Scientist Office’s <a href=\"https://www.cso.scot.nhs.uk/covid19/\">Rapid Research in COVID-19 Programme</a>.   The research portfolio that we have submitted seeks to inform current health protection practice and policy in the provision of quality care in health service settings and the wider community in the context of COVID-19.  It has a particular focus on supporting the mental health of health care professionals, service users and vulnerable communities at a time when their resilience is under significant pressure due to the professional and personal changes brought about by the pandemic and the measures to contain it. On behalf of the Senior Leadership Team, I thank everyone involved for their great collaborative work.</p>\n<p>More broadly, the University community continues to respond to the current situation in creative and big-hearted ways.  As an example of this, our catering contractors have been providing practical catering support to one of our local residential care homes, Carberry House.  Having made contact with the care home, they have been providing goodies for afternoon teas, including our much loved QMU scones.  On top of that, our chef Davie has volunteered to provide cover at Carberry House, while some of their team are self-isolating or unable to work because of family commitments. </p>\n<p>Food is an emerging theme in the support that the QMU community is offering more generally.  “Empty Kitchens, Full Hearts”, a project led by a Gastronomy student, Lewis McLachlan, is a community group of chefs providing free meals from Bridgend Farm in Edinburgh. Between 30 March and 9 April, the group sent out 1050 breakfasts, 1050 lunches and 1050 dinners as well snacks, totally free of charge. We are now looking at whether we can support this initiative by making our catering facilities available to them.</p>\n<p>If you have a story you would like to share, please email <a href=\"mailto:PressOffice@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>PressOffice@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the future, the University’s Recovery Planning Group has now been established and held an initial meeting. This group is undertaking scenario planning for the transition in the future back to a more normal way of studying and working.</p>\n<p>Revised assessment, progression and Boards of Examiners arrangements</p>\n<p>As promised, today we issued finalised details of adjustments to regulations, policy and practice, concerning student assessment, progression and award, as you will have seen from this afternoon’s Moderator message.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Next update</span></p>\n<p>We plan to update you again next Wednesday, unless things change significantly before then.

While the main LRC remains open to students – with social distancing measures in place – we encourage you to consider whether you can access the resources you need online rather than visiting the LRC in person. We will continue to offer a limited space in the LRC for members of staff who, exceptionally, are unable to work from home due to local technology limitations, but to use this space you or your line manager need the authorisation of a Senior Leadership Team member.</p>\n<p>As you might know from our social media posts, we have now closed our sports facilities on campus, and service at Maggie’s is restricted to takeaway only.

We are really sorry about this but are sure that you will understand this move to protect public health.</p>\n<p>If you are a student living on campus, please try to minimise meeting in groups, and, if you feel you must gather, please remember to follow the advice on social distancing. We suggest that you don’t meet in groups any larger than around five or six people at the most. I am sure that many of you are experimenting with virtual social gatherings using various apps.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Progress on online assessments</span></p>\n<p>As you will know from previous messages, staff are working at pace to prepare online assessments to replace those assessments that are normally conducted face to face. Details of your assessments will be published on the Hub as soon as possible.

We are taking this approach because we take our commitment to your learning seriously. The process of preparing for assessments, undertaking assessments and the feedback you receive afterwards are all fundamental aspects of that learning.  However, recognising the disruption you have faced over recent days, and as you will be aware from previous updates, all undergraduate or postgraduate coursework due on or before 3rd April, and all undergraduate dissertations (regardless of their deadline) has had a one week extension applied to their existing deadlines (see 20<sup>th</sup> March update for full details).</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Supporting students in financial need</span></p>\n<p>We know that some students are facing real financial challenges in these extremely difficult times and we are keen to support those of you in this situation. </p>\n<p>Our Senior Leadership Team has been thinking very carefully about how best to support students facing financial difficulties, and to do so fairly based on need. As a result, we will be arranging for a significant increase in our international hardship funds in addition to the existing discretionary funds for UK students. We invite students in need to apply for such funding.</p>\n<p>If you are facing financial hardship then please contact the Student Funding Adviser at <a href=\"mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk\">studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk</a>. The Student Funding Adviser can provide you with advice as well as guidance on how to apply for our hardship and discretionary funds.</p>\n<p>I hope that you find this update helpful.

We have seen many instances of small acts of kindness, and of people going the extra mile to help others. These are the things that lie at the heart of the ethos of Queen Margaret University, and will play a critical part in our ability to navigate our way through the current difficult circumstances.</p>\n<p>As we all get used to studying and working in different ways we will continue to have a number of questions. Please remember that you can access information and FAQs on our <a data-id=\"13958\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2903c860f28b4ce5a34a763573cd0783}\" title=\"FAQs\">coronavirus site</a>.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, there are a few specific matters I would like to draw to your attention.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Reminder of campus access restrictions</span></p>\n<p>Access to the main academic building remains restricted to the Atrium and the Learning Resource Centre (LRC). Although unstaffed, the LRC will be accessible to students via smart card access and available on a 24/7 basis. In order to comply with fire regulations, and to ensure compliance with health and safety requirements, staff are not able to work in the staff office area. If a member of staff needs to access their desk area, e.g. to collect personal possessions, they need authorisation from a member of the Senior Leadership Team who will then advise Security. If staff are unable to work from home due to local technology limitations, an IT workroom will be available within the LRC. However, this area will be subject to social distancing and infection control measures.</p>\n<p>The student accommodation remains open. Social opportunities continue to be provided through the Res:Life team, and resources are available through the Students’ Union (SU). A catering service remains in place in Maggie’s in the SU, as well as a shop which stocks essential provisions, and which will be open seven days a week. The sports centre remains open for students living on campus and for those essential members of staff who still require to be on campus. In all of these areas, you are reminded to follow the government guidance on social distancing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">If you are self-isolating</span></p>\n<p>Please remember that you need to tell the University if you are self-isolating. Staff should report their absence to their line manager and the Head of Human Resources (<a href=\"mailto:asmith2@qmu.ac.uk\">asmith2@qmu.ac.uk</a>) advising whether you are signing off sick or working from home. Students should complete the normal absence form within the Student Portal.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Working at home</span></p>\n<p>HR colleagues have developed some further guidance for staff on tips for working from home and work station set up. These are in addition to the existing Working from Home Guidelines, and can be found on the staff intranet.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Submission deadline extensions</span></p>\n<p>As announced on 19th March, all undergraduate or postgraduate coursework due on or before 3rd April, and all undergraduate dissertations (regardless of their deadline) will have a one week extension applied to their existing deadlines. This update provides further clarification of that announcement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any individual learning plan (ILP) adjustments will apply to the revised extension deadline rather than the original deadline.</li>\n<li>For individual students who had already been granted an extension due to their own Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), this one week extension is additional to the extension granted in response to their ECs.</li>\n<li>Where assessment extensions have already been applied by programme leaders or module co-ordinators for all students on a module, those revised deadlines will not be changed.</li>\n<li>This extension does not apply to assessments where the format and, in some instances, the timing of that assessment has already been modified (e.g. face to face exams that have been moved into an online mode).</li>\n<li>For the avoidance of doubt, all the above only applies to undergraduate or postgraduate coursework due on or before 3rd April, and all undergraduate dissertations (regardless of their deadline).</li>\n<li>Any postgraduate taught student who considers that they have an extenuating circumstance should apply for recognition of that EC in the normal way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any remaining queries regarding the above, please contact your module co-ordinator or programme leader.</p>\n<p>For postgraduate research students (Prof Doc and PhD) whose fieldwork and or data collection has been/will be disrupted by the COVID19 related restrictions, a separate message will be sent directly to you from the Graduate School shortly, but rest assured that we be taking account of the impact of those restrictions on your research activities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Guidance on Looking after your Mental Health and Wellbeing</span></p>\n<p>Our FAQs now include various helpful sources of information, and these are reproduced below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/coronavirus-and-your-wellbeing/\" target=\"_blank\">Coronavirus and your wellbeing - Mind</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://youngminds.org.uk/blog/what-to-do-if-you-re-anxious-about-coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\">What do to if you're anxious about coronavirus</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf?sfvrsn=6d3578af_2\" target=\"_blank\">Mental Health Considerations during COVID-19 outbreak (external PDF)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These resources supplement the University resources available to students through QMU’s Student Services and staff through the HR team (including our Employee Assistance Programme). <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/study-here/student-services/wellbeing-service/\" target=\"_blank\">Our Wellbeing service also has a webpage with useful resources.</a></p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to offer particular thanks to those colleagues who continue to undertake essential roles on campus. Our goal is to continue to keep our campus open, but we are of course only able to achieve that goal through the efforts of those colleagues. Your contribution is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>We will plan to provide a further update early next week, although if there are any significant changes or developments over the weekend then we will of course communicate these earlier than that.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm G.

Given this, we have closed our gym on campus, and service at Maggie’s is restricted to takeaway only.

      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\">Celebrating the good in challenging times</span></p>\n<p>In these challenging times, it is perhaps more important than ever to share news of the good things that people are doing. Across the higher education sector, universities are sharing stories of the work they are doing to contribute to the national effort against the COVID-19 outbreak, under the #WeAreTogether hashtag. At QMU, we are sharing our own stories on social media using the hashtag, and encourage you to send us ideas at <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:PressOfffice@qmu.ac.uk.\" target=\"_blank\">PressOfffice@qmu.ac.uk.</a></p>\n<p>We are particularly proud that 100% of our eligible allied health professional and Nursing students are currently seeking employment or paid placements in the NHS or social care. These final year students are providing much needed support at a time of unprecedented need. In addition to the students working in Scotland, we have a number seeking work in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. I know you will want to join with the Senior Leadership Team in thanking them all for what they are doing for our society, and indeed our own loved ones.</p>\n<p>In the second episode of the QMU Podcast, which was released today, we celebrated the contribution of staff and the Students’ Union in allowing us to adapt to our current way of working and living. With ‘shout outs’ to the IT and security teams, and to students involved in volunteer projects responding to COVID-19, this episode features conversation with Res:Life coordinator Alice Kerr and the President of the Students’ Union. Topics of discussion range from ‘Zooming’ with your grandparents to the best ABBA tracks to cheer you up when you are stuck indoors. As with episode 1, you can access the podcast on Spotify, Deezer, Podchaser, Castbox and Podcast Addict. It’s also now available on Apple and Google Podcasts. Alternatively, you can stream it via <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.spreaker.com/show/qmupodcast\" target=\"_blank\">Spreaker </a>.</p>\n<p>Still on the subject of celebrating the good, I’ll also draw your attention to the nominations for the Students’ Union STAR Awards. Based on student votes, this award scheme celebrates the contribution of staff to the student experience, and the contribution of students to University life. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.qmusu.org.uk/top-menu/your-voice/star-awards/2020-nominees\" target=\"_blank\">See the nominations.</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Revised assessment, progression and Boards of Examiners arrangements</span></p>\n<p>Last week, I let you know that we expected to have finalised details of adjustments to regulations, policy and practice, concerning student assessment, progression and award, and to the operation of Boards of Examiners. I can confirm that we plan to be able to share details with you on Friday.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Staff rest days</span></p>\n<p>As you will know from the Moderator communication yesterday, all staff are being given two rest days, with the first being this coming Monday (Easter Monday). This move is part of our efforts to support staff health and wellbeing at the current time, and in recognition of their extraordinary efforts in recent weeks. We ask both staff and students to avoid emailing staff on these rest days, wherever possible. We are, of course, acutely conscious that students’ need to seek support from staff is increased at this time, and so these rest days have been spaced out partly to minimise their impact on students. Thank you for your support.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Staff health and wellbeing more generally</span></p>\n<p>It is important that staff continue to take leave, as managing the work/life balance is essential in order for us to keep fit and well. This is still true even although we are much more limited in what we can do while we are on annual leave. We would ask staff to continue to take annual leave during the coronavirus situation, and to switch off entirely from work when they are on annual leave. The Senior Leadership Team are adopting this approach themselves too. As a reminder the current leave year ends on 31 July 2020, and the University’s Annual Leave Policy is available here</p>\n<p>Additionally, while working remotely, we all need to ensure that we take breaks and take other steps to protect our wellbeing. Remember you can find information and support on health and wellbeing at <a data-id=\"14108\" href=\"/{localLink:14108}\" title=\"At Home\">QMU@Home</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Joint work across the higher education sector</span></p>\n<p>In earlier updates, I’ve let you know about some of the joint work across the higher education sector, and with partners and government, to address the challenges arising from the current situation. You might be interested to know that, over the last week, the higher education sector and Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) met (online) to discuss opportunities for joint approaches. Attended by our Principal, this was a very productive meeting, at which participants found they had much in the way of a common cause.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Next update</span></p>\n<p>We plan to update you again on Friday after the (online) meeting of the Business Continuity Group that day, unless something significant changes, in which case we will update you earlier.</p>"

In addition, it features blogs in which individual staff members describe how our present circumstances are affecting them and how they are adjusting.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a student or a staff member, you might be interested in another example of how our academic expertise can provide insightful perspectives on our current situation. This example is from an <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/young-masters-change-can-help-win-coronavirus-war-sarah-haywood-2523689\" target=\"_blank\">opinion piece</a> that appeared in the Scotsman last week, by Sarah Haywood of our Division of Occupational Therapy and Arts Therapies. Drawing on her experience managing and delivering an in-house mental health service in a secondary school in Scotland, Sarah highlights the factors in teenagers’ favour when it comes to coping with the changes provoked by coronavirus, while also acknowledging their anxieties, of course.</p>\n<p>New advice for staff and students for research involving human participants will be issued today (06 April 2020) via Moderator. The advice addresses how the QMU Research Ethics Panel (REP) requires all ongoing and planned research to make changes to how participant interactions are conducted, and the notification and approval of those changes.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Next update</span></p>\n<p>We plan to update you again on Wednesday after the (online) meeting of the Business Continuity Group that day, unless something significant changes, in which case we will update you earlier.</p>"

Whether students are living in halls, or private rented accommodation, the advice is that they should remain there and stay indoors while current restrictions are in force. The minister goes on to say he understands that this is a worrying time and many students will want to be with their families. Nevertheless, he emphasises that staying put in accommodation and adhering to the directives issued by the Chief Medical Officer and the Scottish and UK governments is the best way to slow the rate of transmission of COVID-19, protect our NHS from being overwhelmed and save lives.</p>\n<p>As you would expect, the Senior Leadership Team at QMU supports the minister’s position.

The University appreciates that this is an anxious period for students, and we can reassure all students that our regulations for the operation of Boards of Examiners, and our assessment regulations, do allow Boards of Examiners to exercise discretion in coming to a decision on student progression and awards where circumstances, such as the current ones, make it appropriate to do so. Evidence considered by the Boards will include reports from staff on special circumstances affecting student performance.</li>\n<li>Thinking particularly of students in the halls of residence, please do continue to adhere to the<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others\" target=\"_blank\"> Government’s social distancing guidance</a>, tough though this is.

The submission deadline on 27 November 2020 will no longer apply, and a new submission deadline will be announced no later than eight months prior to the deadline. The UK higher education funding bodies recognise the significant effort that has been invested so far by institutions in preparations for the current REF cycle and in view of this the REF staff census date (31 July 2020) remains unchanged.</li>\n<li>Following this recent guidance we are pausing some of our internal REF activities and rescheduling others which were due to take place over the forthcoming months. This includes extending the REF 2021 appeals deadline to 27th April 2020 for decisions on the identification of staff with significant responsibility for research. A review of the REF institutional timetable will take place in line with the recent guidance published. As this is a constantly evolving situation, we will continue to monitor and take necessary actions in line with government advice, keeping staff fully briefed as soon as external guidance is received. QMU will also remain engaged with the UK higher education funding bodies in the coming weeks to gather further information as the situation develops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If staff do have enquiries or concerns regarding the REF 2021 Project and these recent developments, please contact <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:REF2021Project@qmu.ac.uk.\" target=\"_blank\">REF2021Project@qmu.ac.uk.</a></p>\n<p>Reminder of campus building closures</p>\n<p>I will take this opportunity to remind you that there is no access to the main academic building, and that this applies to both staff (excluding essential security staff) and students.

We anticipate that we be able to provide accommodation for any students who wish to stay beyond their current occupancy end date, and may be able to assist students whose private rental accommodation is coming to an end and would like to move into our halls of residence (for further information contact  accommodation@qmu.ac.uk).</p>\n<p>In parallel with this, we will be arranging a significant increase in our international hardship funds in addition to increasing the existing discretionary funds for UK students. We invite students in need to apply for such funding. One benefit of this approach is that it can encompass students in private rented accommodation, as well as those living on campus. If you are facing financial hardship and are finding difficulty with living costs then please contact the Student Funding Adviser at <a href=\"mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk\">studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>Furthermore, we will be sympathetic to requests from students who are experiencing financial hardship to extend their university accommodation payment terms, so that they can pay their outstanding balance over a longer period of time than originally planned.  Students who are experiencing hardship and in need of such payment extension should contact <a href=\"mailto:creditcontroller@qmu.ac.uk\">creditcontroller@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">24 March 2020</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The latest instructions from Government</span></p>\n<p>You will be aware from <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/effective-lockdown-to-be-introduced\" target=\"_blank\">announcements last night by the British Prime Minister and the Scottish First Minister</a> that the United Kingdom is from today in a state of effective lockdown to arrest the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>As you will appreciate, this is no longer a matter of advice or guidance – it is a direct instruction from our governments to everyone in this country and will be enforceable by the public authorities, including the police. In any case, we are confident that you will want to comply, to support our collective effort to limit the threat we face.</p>\n<p>The only reasons you should now leave your home (or flat in student accommodation) are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible;</li>\n<li>One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household;</li>\n<li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person;</li>\n<li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home;</li>\n<li>Public gatherings of any more than two people are no longer permitted, unless they are members of your own family.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Further restrictions on campus</span></p>\n<p>As a result of the new instructions from Government, we will be closing the main academic building completely, including the LRC.</p>\n<p>Acutely conscious of our duty of care to students living on campus, we will still have security staff in place, of course. They can be contacted on 0131 474 0000 and extension 2222. Students living on campus can also reach them via the intercom points across campus (eg at the entrance to the main academic building and accommodation).</p>\n<p>Working remotely, our RES:LIFE team will continue to support students living on campus, working in partnership with the Student Services team and the Students’ Union.</p>\n<p>We will continue to offer a pop-up shop for students living on campus, providing essential provisions. Except for access to the pop-up shop, the Sports/Students’ Union building will be closed.</p>\n<p>Beyond essential Campus Services (security) staff, no staff are permitted on campus.

We expect colleagues in this situation to continue to work from home where possible, but we recognise that it may be difficult for those with young children to do so during their normal working hours and/or to work a full working day. We will continue to provide full pay to all staff in this position, and in return we would ask that staff, where possible, exercise a degree of flexibility.</p>\n<p>Also, we would remind colleagues of the need to continue to take planned annual leave, and to ensure that they switch off completely from work when doing so. We recognise that some members of staff may wish to take additional annual leave to allow them to fulfil childcare commitments, and we can confirm that line managers will be as flexible as possible in responding to any such requests.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">IT advice and support</span></p>\n<p>You will have seen the Moderator message from the IT team yesterday.  From that message, please note in particular that you should access both Microsoft Teams and Collaborate via your web browser, and not via the QMU desktop.  The desktop is not configured to support web conferencing of any type.  Also, if you require access to admin rights on your QMU supplied device, please raise a call through Assist and the IT team will respond.  Please do read Moderator messages in order to keep up with IT updates, particularly as these updates reflect queries and issues that have been raised by staff and students.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Blackboard Collaborate </span></p>\n<p>This is available for teaching purposes and can also be accessed via the Home Working webpage.  The IT team are currently running virtual Collaborate training sessions to ensure colleagues have the necessary abilities to use the solution.  We would strongly encourage engaging with this training. <a href=\"/study-here/learning-facilities/it-services/learning-and-technologies/real-time-learning-collaborate/\">Find out more</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">An opportunity for students</span></p>\n<p>We are conscious that the current situation means that many students find themselves suddenly without paid work.  You might be interested to know that NHS Lothian are inviting students to apply to join their staff bank. This opportunity is not necessarily for front line staff, and could encompass drivers, administrators etc. as well as healthcare support workers.  If you were to join the bank, you would be helping the NHS at a time of intense need. If you are interested, please email <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:covid19recruitment@nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk.\" target=\"_blank\">covid19recruitment@nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk. </a>Our understanding is that they are interested in all students, not only those undertaking health sciences programmes.</p>\n<p>Remember that you can access information and FAQs on our <a href=\"/coronavirus/\">coronavirus webpages</a>. As ever, thank you for your support and positive spirit as we all adjust and adapt to new ways of working and living. </p>"

This information will be updated as required to reflect any developments in local and national Covid-19 planning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The student residential accommodation remains open and staff will be available during normal working hours at the accommodation reception and will continue to offer social opportunities through RES:LIFE.</li>\n<li>The Sports Centre will remain open only for students living on campus and those essential staff still working on campus.</li>\n<li>Catering services will be available within Maggie’s, in the Students’ Union, with 1875, the University shop and Starbucks closed.  In addition a pop up shop is available in Maggie’s for residents on campus. This will stock essential provisions and will be open seven days a week.</li>\n<li>Access to the main academic building will be restricted to the Atrium and the Learning Resource Centre which, although unstaffed, will be accessible to students and staff via smart card access and available on a 24/7 basis.  In order to comply with fire regulations, and to ensure compliance with health and safety requirements, access to staff offices will be limited and will require authorisation.</li>\n<li>Campus Services staff will be available as a first point of contact 24 hours a day via main reception and on the main contact number (0131 474 0000) and extension 2222. The campus will be closed to external visitors, except where authorised by a member of the Senior Leadership Team.</li>\n<li>Students’ Union staff will be available during normal working hours either via <a href=\"mailto:union@qmu.ac.uk\">union@qmu.ac.uk</a> or on Facebook @qmusu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In accordance with Government guidance, social distancing and infection control measures will be in place across the accessible areas of the campus highlighted above as and where appropriate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/85ff398de7544578a992ce0857cfe23f}\" title=\"Remote Access\" data-udi=\"umb://document/85ff398de7544578a992ce0857cfe23f\">Remote functionality for working or studying away from campus will be fully available</a>.

The Senior Leadership Team agrees that is important that we all continue to take leave, as managing the work/life balance is essential in order for us to keep fit and well. This is still true even although we are much more limited in what we can do while we are on annual leave. We would ask staff to continue to take annual leave during the coronavirus situation, and to switch off entirely from work when they are on annual leave. The Senior Leadership Team will adopt this approach themselves too. Additionally, while working remotely, we all need to ensure that we take breaks and take other steps to protect our wellbeing.  The HR team are preparing updated guidance on remote working, with useful hints and tips, which we will share with you as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Information sources</span></p>\n<p>Do keep up to date with our FAQs, which we continue to keep up to date. Over the next day or so, we will provide a list of useful email addresses for contacting service teams remotely.

Paul convenes the Business Continuity Group and has been working intensively with colleagues across the University to enable us to respond to events in the optimum way.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The emotional impact of the current developments</span></p>\n<p>Although this message focuses on practical matters, I do want to take this opportunity to say that the Senior Leadership Team is deeply conscious of how upsetting the current situation is to so many of us. In addition to those of you with a heightened risk, or worried about vulnerable family members, and international students having to return home at haste, we are also conscious of students who have had their first year on campus suddenly cut short, sports teams and societies who have prepared for events that have had to be cancelled or postponed, final year students who were looking forward to events celebrating the successful end of their studies and staff who will miss face to face interaction with their students and the camaraderie gained from working alongside colleagues in an office. I know that you will all look out for one another and keep in touch with your friends, classmates and colleagues while you are at home. Together, we will get through this in the best possible way. Thank you for your support.</p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm G Cutt</strong><br /><strong>Director of Operations and Finance</strong></p>"

      "content": "<p>I will begin this update by reiterating the strong advice from <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/people-advised-to-limit-social-contact/\" target=\"_blank\">Government </a>yesterday that people who are pregnant, or over 70, or who are at high risk or have underlying health conditions should stay at home as much as possible and significantly reduce their social contact. If you fall into any of these categories, please do not come to the campus.  If someone in your household is pregnant, or over 70, or is at high risk or has underlying health conditions, you should also stay at home</p>\n<p>More generally, the latest advice is that all of us should reduce our unnecessary social contact, and we are trying to minimise the number of people on campus. If you are able to work from home, please do so. If you are not certain whether you can work from home please ask your line manager, who can in turn call on the advice of the Senior Leadership Team.  The majority of both academic and professional services staff should now be able to work from home. Generally, the exception is in essential frontline services, and we are planning appropriate procedures to protect the health and safety of such staff, eg through social distancing and infection control measures.</p>\n<p>The new guidance from Government last night also extended the requirements for self-isolation. Now, members of a household where someone has suspected symptoms should stay at home for 14 days. For students, this means that if someone in your shared student residence has symptoms, the entire flat should self-isolate for 14 days. While it might be tempting to return home to your families in such a circumstances, remember that your family would then need to self-isolate too.</p>\n<p>There will be no classes or assessments on campus from tomorrow (Wednesday).</p>\n<p>As communicated before, the campus will remain open. The Business Continuity Team are currently working out the specifics of what will remain open, and to whom, balancing health and safety with the need to ensure, for example, the wellbeing of students living on campus. However, the campus will be closed to external visitors – except with the agreement of the Senior Leadership Team – from Wednesday 18 March.</p>\n<p>For the rest of this week, the Student Services team will be available to meet with students face to face, with these services moving online from next week. Alongside this, we are considering a range of other issues related to student wellbeing, including, for example ensuring ongoing catering for students on campus (again factoring in social distancing etc).</p>\n<p>We are working to ensure that most University services remain fully operational online. For example, you will continue to be able to access the support of the Assist team at <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:assist@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">assist@qmu.ac.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>In case you are wondering, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus as yet in the QMU community. A number of students and staff are self-isolating, which is to be expected, of course, given the wide range of criteria for self-isolation.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for the way you are working with us as we introduce all the above measures to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the more vulnerable in our society.  QMU has a great community spirit, and I am sure that we will all continue to be kind to each other and be mutually supportive as we move into a rather different way of living and working over the weeks to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm G Cutt</strong><br /><strong>Director of Operations and Finance</strong></p>"

Please note that parking restrictions on campus will be lifted.</p>\n<p>For students, if you are in an at risk category, you should not come into the campus tomorrow.  More generally, unless you have an assessment tomorrow, students are not expected on campus. </p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm Cutt</strong><br /><strong>Director of Operations and Finance</strong></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Our Business Continuity Group is meeting every day this week as we move towards online delivery of learning and teaching (to be fully in place by Monday 23 March), and as we plan online delivery of exams and assessments.</p>\n<p>At this stage, we would like to highlight the following points. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The latest guidance for those with symptoms suggestive of coronavirus:</strong> people with symptoms suggestive of coronavirus - a fever or a new cough - should stay at home for seven days as per <a href=\"https://news.gov.scot/news/people-with-symptoms-told-to-stay-at-home\">the advice of Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer on 12 March</a>. Those who have been in contact with someone who is experiencing symptoms need only stay at home if they themselves begin to experience symptoms. Please report your absence to your line manager and the Head of Human Resources (<a href=\"mailto:asmith2@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>asmith2@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a>) (staff), advising whether you are signing off sick or working from home. Students should complete the normal absence form within the Student Portal. If you are experiencing the above symptoms and have been in contact with an infected person or have travelled abroad recently, if you have travelled to the UK from <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/a-to-z-of-topics/covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>specified areas</strong></a> in the last 14 days, or have been in contact with someone with coronavirus, and you develop symptoms of cough, fever or shortness of breath, you should call <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care/nhs-111/\"><strong>NHS 111</strong></a> (but importantly do not visit your GP practice in person). </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Suspension of all but essential business travel at QMU, both in the UK and aboard:</strong> The University is suspending all but essential business travel, both in the UK and abroad.  If you are a staff member with plans to travel and you think this travel is essential, please discuss this with your Line Manager. If they agree that your travel is essential, they will need will need to discuss this with <a href=\"mailto:hs-staff@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>QMU Health and Safety</strong></a> . If you are a student planning travel related to your studies at QMU, please speak to your Programme Leader, who will then need to seek the advice of <a href=\"mailto:hs-staff@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>QMU Health and Safety</strong></a>. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Policy on campus visitors:</strong> Although we are not holding public events from 23 March, we continue to allow visitors to the campus. As you would expect, we have appropriate signage and guidance in place for visitors. Our policy is in line with advice from Health Protection Scotland and will remain under review.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Students wishing to return home can do so: </strong>We understand that some students, particularly those from overseas, may be anxious and may feel the need to return home. If you do decide to return home, your academic progress will not be adversely affected.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remote working support for students and staff:  </strong>We strongly encourage you to take the time to read the Moderator message on this subject published today, and repeated on social media. Staff will have received an additional Moderator message on Hub training resources. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remember that your University remains open</strong>: Although we are changing our mode of learning and teaching as already communicated,  staff and students can be on campus, and our library, specialist facilities, student services, refectory, halls of residence and Students’ Union remain open. We will continue to monitor and comply with advice from Health Protection Scotland and take any necessary steps, including possible campus closure, if we are advised to do so in the future.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The student residences remain open and will continue to remain open as usual: </strong>ResLife support for students in residences will continue to be available; all students are welcome to talk to their Senior Residents, the RLAs, and the Residence Life Coordinator at any point.  The team have events planned for April and will keep residents up to date via the ResLife <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/qmureslife/about/\">Facebook page</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Graduation and Degree Certificates: </strong>July 2020 graduation ceremonies will be rescheduled, most likely to autumn 2020. All student degree awards will be approved and signed off by the University Senate, as they are each year in the normal course of events. This means that if you would have been eligible to graduate at the July ceremony, your degree award certificate will be sent to you in July this year at your registered home address.  Your degree award will be recorded as having been conferred upon you on the date that Senate approves the award.  Importantly, receipt of your award certification does not prevent you from participating fully in the rescheduled graduation ceremony. Further details on the rescheduled graduation ceremonies will be communicated once they are available.<strong> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2903c860f28b4ce5a34a763573cd0783}\" title=\"FAQs\" data-udi=\"umb://document/df16ed2c10f94d29bc901be143733ee3\"><strong>FAQs</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of us in the Business Continuity Team and the Senior Leadership Team have been very impressed by the positive way that the University community is responding to the measures we are taking, and the way you are all supporting each other.  We have been struck too by the socially responsible attitude of staff and students as we all work together to help delay the spread of COVID-19 and to protect and support those in our community more vulnerable to the illness. </p>"

We are well prepared for this and we will let you know if and when we have a confirmed case in our community.</strong></p>\n<p>You will already know from my last message that the University has been preparing carefully for the potential impact of coronavirus across a number of areas. We are working hard to mitigate against the impact of any escalation in the situation, including considering the impact on teaching delivery over the next few weeks until the end of the academic session. This includes prioritising teaching that is essential to degree completion or professional registration.

In terms of operations at QMU, you can rest assured that we are doing everything we can to minimise the impact of coronavirus on you.</p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm Cutt</strong><br /><strong>Director of Operations and Finance</strong></p>"
