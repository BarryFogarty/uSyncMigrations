      <Value><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday 9 November 2017, over 60 guests attended a special event on campus to mark the occasion, including students who have received Santander scholarships; QMU staff and students who have benefitted from research and mobility funding; students, graduates and local SMEs who participated in the Santander Universities SME Internship Programme and local charities who have received Community Awards. </p>
<p>Over the last 10 years Santander Universities partnership with QMU has provided support for over 400 staff, students, SMEs and charities.</p>
<p>The total financial commitment from Santander to QMU over the last 10 years is over £766,000. This funding has been used to increase the University’s international reach, develop links with the local community, encourage outstanding research and teaching, and enhance employability for QMU students and graduates.</p>
<p>In recognition of the huge commitment from Santander Universities over the last decade, QMU has created a permanent dedication to the partnership by naming one of its lecture theatres - The Santander Lecture Theatre.</p>
<p>QMU is proud to have been the first university in Scotland to have become a partner of Santander, which is committed to higher education in the UK and around the world.  Commenting on the partnership, Dr Richard Butt, Deputy Principal of QMU, said: “Ten years on since establishing our partnership with Santander, we celebrate the tremendous support we have received, which comes at a time when we are also celebrating 10 years at our campus in East Lothian. </p>
<p>“I’m delighted that Santander became a partner, supporter and collaborator at that time, marking our joint commitment to enhancing our student’s employability, increasing the University’s international reach, developing our links with the local community, encouraging innovation and promoting entrepreneurial qualities.</p>
<p>“Support from Santander makes a huge difference to our students, our staff and our community every single day, and I’m so privileged to have witnessed the transformational effects that this support has had on the University over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>“Santander has played a key role in shaping QMU now and in the future, ensuring we continue to make progress in our core goals of social justice, outstanding research and teaching and providing an excellent student experience. I’d like to extend my thanks to Santander for 10 years of funding and support. Long may our partnership go from strength to strength.”</p>
<p>Santander Universities Director, Matt Hutnell, attended the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary partnership celebration event on campus, along with other senior members of the Santander team. He added: “Santander is committed to supporting higher education as well as local communities across the UK. Our partnership is a great example of how two very different institutions can work together and run joint programmes that help both our students and also support our local community.</p>
<p>“It has been a privilege working alongside Queen Margaret University over the last 10 years and we look forward to the next decade exploring new and innovative ways of ensuring hundreds of students and staff at the University prosper.”</p>
<p>The special event formed part of a year-long campaign marking the 10th anniversary of QMU’s move to its newly built campus in Musselburgh in 2007.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, QMU has responded to our fast changing world with agility, positivity and a practical approach. Since relocating, the University has seen its student numbers grow, and has moved up the rankings in terms of research output. Today, the institution is ranked first in Scotland and third in the UK for graduate employability.</p>
