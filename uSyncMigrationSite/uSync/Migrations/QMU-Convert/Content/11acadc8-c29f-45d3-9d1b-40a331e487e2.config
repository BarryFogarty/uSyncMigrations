      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone goes straight from school to university. People take different pathways into education depending on their circumstances. Our Associate Student scheme offers a different route to securing a place on a degree course at QMU. </p>
<p>Associate students are fully enrolled as QMU students from day one, but study for the first year at a partner college on a relevant Higher National (HN) course. On successful completion, associate students will have a guaranteed place at QMU to complete their degree. A number of our degrees are available through the Associate Student scheme and are listed below. The entry requirements for all of our Associate Student routes are CCC at Higher, or equivalent.</p>]]></Value>

As you work through the HN, the college and QMU will prepare you for the more independent learning style and the academic standards required at university level.</p>\n<p>If you have been out of education for a while, or have been working in industry and now want to gain a relevant qualification, college may be a more suitable entry route for you. Colleges specialise in helping people returning to education after a break and learning styles are a lot more vocational and practical than in higher education. The first year of the associate student routes is designed to reflect these types of learning styles.<br />You may have found that your Higher results after school are not good enough to get into university. The Associate Student routes offer entry to QMU degrees with slightly lower entry qualifications because the first year is spent at college.<br />As you progress through your HN course we will arrange visits to the University campus, workshops on academic skills and guest lectures — this will ensure you are well prepared for the transition to QMU.</p>\n<p>You will be in a class where there are other associate students, so you will be able to make friends with the people you will study with for four years, before joining a bigger cohort of students at QMU to complete the degree.</p>"
