<p> School Experience is a compulsory part of the ITE learning process. It allows students the opportunity to gain experience of practice-based teaching and learning within a classroom setting. Both the host School and the University have a joint responsibility in ensuring that students are given appropriate opportunities to gain the required knowledge and understanding, skills and abilities expected of a student teacher for the appropriate stage of their professional development within the school context and their ITE University Programme.</p>
<p>School Experience enables the acquisition of new knowledge and skills as well as the application, consolidation and reflection on learning gained within the University environment. School and University-based Educators, working in collaboration, therefore have a crucial part to play in supporting students’ progress to meet the General Teaching Council, Scotland (GTCS) Standard forProvisional Registration (SPR). The success of School Experience is highly dependent on a clear and supportive interchange between ITE students, university, the local authority and schools.

At QMU, the term ‘disabled’ relates to the impact of an illness, impairment, developmental disorder or specific learning difficulty on the specific tasks associated with university level study. The Disability Service works with a broad range of students including those with long term medical conditions (such as MS, epilepsy, diabetes, chronic fatigue etc), mental health difficulties, sensory impairments, physical impairments, those on the autism spectrum and those with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia).</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/student-services/disability-service/\" title=\"QMU Disability Service\">QMU Disability Service</a></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Disabled students are actively encouraged to meet with the Disability Adviser (DA) to discuss their Individual Learning Plan (ILP). Disability Advisers email the ILP to the university’s Academic Disabled Students Coordinator (ADSC) as this is an opportunity for dialogue between them to check if there is a recommendation which may need to be amended. In some circumstances, though not often, the DA may ask the ADSC to share the ILP with relevant academics. The student can of course choose to share their ILP for any reasonable adjustments and assessment arrangements to be made, which may be necessary to enable them to meet the learning outcomes of each school experience. QMU acknowledges that not all information about a student’s disability or health may be relevant to placement providers and that normally, information would be provided with student’s agreement. Reasonable adjustments during school experience are dependent on students disclosing a disability or health condition, or at least, sharing information about their needs with the placement provider.</p>\n<p>Students should keep their Personal Academic Tutor, or Programme Leader, University and School- Based Educators, Disability Service and their ADSC informed of any changes to their health status. It is essential that students discuss any concerns they may have with staff as early as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>If students require further information or advice they should contact the Disability Service for a confidential chat.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

If the issues require more immediate action, or are not resolved following the Mid-way Review, then a Cause for Concern form needs to be completed and forwarded to the University. The University Based-Educator and the SBE will support the student in drawing up an Action Plan to help them overcome their targets. The final stage of this process if targets are not met, may be a referral to the PPC.</p>\n<p>If a student does not achieve the required number of satisfactory grades this could lead to a retrieval placement in late August/early September, as agreed by the Board of Examiners. In this case to be eligible to graduate and progress into practice it would first be necessary to successfully complete any retrieval placement(s).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Professional Progress Committee (PPC)</strong></p>\n<p>If a student’s progress is deemed unsatisfactory, or for some reason the student is unable to complete the placement, then the University-Based Educator (University Lecturer) will arrange a pre– Professional Progress Committee meeting where both reflect on the issues and agree how the student will progress. This is noted and then presented at the main Professional Progress Committee which will consider the circumstances and make a final recommendation about progression.</p>\n<p>These recommendations usually take one of three forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>continuing the programme with further advice, support and monitoring</li>\n<li>carrying out an extended or retrieval placement in another school*</li>\n<li>termination of the ITE programme.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In the event of the last recommendation, the QMU Board of Examiners may decide that such PGDE students may leave the programme with a Certificate of Professional Education.
