<p><span class="lead">1.0 Preparing for Recruitment</span> <br /><br />The first stage of the recruitment procedure is for the line manager (in consultation with Human Resources if appropriate) to determine the type of post they wish to recruit for: <br /><br />(a) an existing position within the core structure; <br />In the case of recruiting for an existing position within the core structure the line manager should liaise with Human Resources to review the up to date job description for the post. Where any amendments to the position are envisaged please refer to (c). <br /><br />(b) a new position; <br />All new positions must be graded through the HERA job evaluation system. The line manager will be required to complete the Role Outline Form and submit to Human Resources. Human Resources will grade the position and inform the line manager of the grade. The Role Outline Form will form the basis for the job description and person specification. Guidance on the completion of the Role Outline Form and HERA is available from Human Resources. <br /><br />(c) A position within the core structure with amendments; <br />Where an existing position within the establishment is amended the line manager should consult with Human Resources to advise whether the role requires to be re-evaluated. If it is determined the role must be re-evaluated the procedure described in (b) will apply. <br /><br />(d) a project funded position <br />For project funded posts that do not currently exist within the University establishment it will be necessary for the role to be graded through HERA to identify the appropriate grade for the role. Project funded posts with finite funding attached may be advertised at a single point or within a limited range within the grade band depending on the funding available. <br /><br />Template job descriptions are available for research roles which can be provided to determine the appropriate grade; further information is available from Human Resources.</p>
<p><span class="lead">2.0 Vacancy Approval Procedure (VAP)</span></p>
<p>Managers should refer to the Vacancy Approval Procedure (VAP) for guidance on requesting authorisation to recruit. <br /><br />Posts funded out with the University’s establishment i.e. project funded posts must also follow the Vacancy Approval Procedure (VAP).</p>
<p><span class="lead">3.0 Vacancy Planning Discussion</span> <br /><br />Following approval from VAP, the vacancy planning discussion should be held between the recruiting manager and the relevant HR Partner to determine how the recruitment process should be progressed. The vacancy planning discussion is likely to include the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertise internally or externally;</li>
<li>recruitment methods;</li>
<li>recruitment timescales and;</li>
<li>the job description and advert;</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">4.0 Re-deployment</span> <br /><br />In line with the University’s Redundancy and Re-deployment Protocol all those at risk or under notice of redundancy will be made aware of vacancies before they are advertised internally or externally. Recruitment timescales should take into account the time required to accommodate potential re-deployment. Further information in regards to the process of re-deployment is available from the Redundancy and Redeployment Protocol available from the HR intranet site.</p>
<p><span class="lead">5.0 Advert Placement</span> <br /><br />Human Resources will arrange for the advert to be placed, where appropriate, specifying the closing date which is normally two weeks after the last publication of the advertisement. Where practicable the advert should also include the intended date of interview. <br /><br />The line manager together with Human Resources should determine whether the advert should be placed as internal only initially or whether the advert should be circulated externally. Normally all vacancies will be advertised on the QMU vacancies webpage. A summary of vacancies will be provided via the staff Moderator on a weekly basis.  <br /><br />Where a current employee applies for a vacancy they must inform their current line manager that they have applied.</p>
<p><span class="lead">6.0 Vacancy Details Accessed by Applicants</span> <br /><br />Applicants can access information on our current vacancies and apply online via university’s vacancies page. An advert and job description will be available together with an online application form. <br /><br /><span class="lead">7.0 Completed Applications</span> <br /><br />Following the advert closing date the recruiting manager will be able to access the application forms for the vacancy via Manager Self Service in iTrent. <br /><br />Following the closing date Human Resources will send the recruiting manager the following documents in electronic format in order for the shortlisting process to be carried out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortlisting Grid</li>
<li>Shortlising Guidance Notes (Appendix 2)</li>
<li>Interview Arrangements Form (Appendix 3)</li>
<li>Job Description and Person Specification</li>
</ul>
<p> Human Resources will notify the recruiting manager of any disabled applicants so that their application can be considered under the double tick disability mark.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.0 Shortlisting</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Chair of the Appointment Panel has overall responsibility for shortlisting however shortlisting should be carried out by all members of the Appointment Panel. It is the responsibility of the Chair of the Appointment Panel to share the electronic copies of the application forms and other shortlisting materials with the panel members. Where possible applications should be reviewed electronically.</li>
<li>Applicants must be assessed in relation to the criteria in the Person Specification which describes the essential and desirable criteria for the position. In order to comply with good employment practice and equalities legislation, it is critical that the criteria are applied equally and consistently to all applicants.</li>
<li>Candidates meeting the essential criteria should be shortlisted initially. Desirable criteria may then be applied to reduce a large number of applicants who meet the essential criteria</li>
<li>The Chair of the Appointment Panel has responsibility for completing the Shortlisting Grid with reasons for shortlisting/not shortlisting. Human Resources will retain the Shortlisting Grid as a record of the reasons for shortlisting or not shortlisting candidates.</li>
<li>Once shortlisting is complete the Chair of the Appointment Panel must update iTrent with the progression of each candidate.</li>
<li>There is a requirement for members of the Appointment Panel to declare any relationship to, or interest in a candidate, an Integrity Form is provided for this purpose</li>
<li>The Chair should then complete the Interview Arrangement Form (Appendix 3) and return it to Human Resources. (At least two weeks prior to the proposed interview date).</li>
<li>Any special arrangements for the interview process such as presentations, tests or tours etc. must be included on this form.</li>
<li>Any application that have been printed and are not being brought forward for interview should be returned to HR so that the copies may be confidentially destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">9.0 Invitation to Interview</span> <br /><br />Human Resources will take responsibility for inviting candidates to interview on the basis of the following arrangements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, candidates will be informed via email of the interview details including arrangements for tests, presentations etc. and invited to book a slot for interview. Human Resources will liaise with the Chair of the Appointment Panel on any appropriate provisions to be made for candidates who need special arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">10.0 Eligibility to Work in the UK</span> <br /><br />Candidates will be asked in the invitation to interview to bring their passport with them to interview in order to evidence their eligibility to work in the UK. A copy of the front page and photo page will be taken by a member of the Appointment panel on the day of interview. If they do not have a valid passport the UKVI provide a list of acceptable documentation. <br /><br />All copies will be held in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and as set out in our Privacy Notice for job applicants; passport copies for unsuccessful candidates will be confidentially destroyed 6 months following the end of the recruitment process. <br /><br /><span class="lead">11.0 Testing </span><br /><br />Human Resources can administer, personality, aptitude and ability testing as part of the selection process. Testing can take place prior to or on the day of interview, specific arrangements for testing should be discussed and agreed between the Chair of the Appointment Panel and the relevant HR Partner. <br /><br />Interview Preparation <br /><br />The Chair of the Appointment Panel should prepare the questions for interview based on the competencies described in the job description. Example questions are provided in the Competency Based Interview Question Bank (Appendix 6). <br /><br />Once drafted the Chair of the Appointment Panel should send the questions to the relevant HR Partner for review (at least one week prior to the interview date) so that a final set of interview questions is agreed upon. <br /><br />All panel members are required to complete the Unconscious Bias e-Learning module prior to sitting on an interview panel. This module can be accessed via the link made available on the e-Learning page on the HR intranet site. <br /><br /><span class="lead">12.0 Interview Materials</span> <br /><br />In advance of the interviews Human Resources will email the following documents to the panel members</p>
<ul>
<li>Interview programme</li>
<li>Job Description/Person Specification and Advert</li>
<li>Competency Based Interview Schedule (including interview questions)</li>
<li>Salary scales (Chair only)</li>
<li>New Employee Appointment form (Chair only) <br /><br />Individual panel members are responsible for printing the applications if required for interview.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">13.0 Interviews</span> <br /><br />The Chair of the Appointment Panel is responsible for setting the tone for the interview from the introductions to the conduct of the interview including the allocation of areas for questioning to continuity, impartiality and time management. The Chair also has responsibility for ensuring that the members of the Appointment Panel’s judgements are based on a proper consideration of the requirements of the post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each candidate should be considered in relation to the person specification, job description and identified competencies, disregarding any discriminatory factors</li>
<li>All members of the Appointment Panel should complete a Competency Based Interview Schedule for each candidate, documenting a summary of the evidence provided in response to the competency based interview questions – it is important that interviewers do not record any comments that could be construed as discriminatory e.g. relating to a person’s age or appearance as this information may be requested by a candidate using a subject access request under the General Data Protection Regulations</li>
<li>Each member of the Appointment Panel should score each candidate after all interviews have taken place, agreed scores for each candidate can be recorded on the Scoring Summary Grid (Appendix 7).</li>
<li>The Chair should facilitate joint discussions on the suitability of each candidate, so that a consensus decision can be reached</li>
<li>At the end of the panel discussions, the Chair should complete a New Employee Appointment form and update iTrent with the outcome of the interviews.</li>
<li>All Applications Forms and other documentation should be returned to Human Resources</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">14.0 Presentations </span><br /><br />In some cases it is appropriate for a presentation to form part of the interview assessment process. Normally presentations will be delivered to the appointment panel as part of the interview. There are some cases where it is appropriate for candidates to deliver a presentation to an invited audience (in most cases this will be staff members from the area where the vacancy exists). In cases such as these, normally, the appointment panel will be present. To ensure a fair and transparent process is followed the chair of the panel should ensure that: </p>
<ul>
<li>The candidates are aware prior to the day of the presentation that they will be presenting to an invited audience.</li>
<li>The audience are fully briefed as to the purpose of the presentation and have been asked to provide feedback on the Presentation Evaluation Form (Appendix 8) to the Chair of the Appointment Panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">15.0 Reference Requests</span> <br /><br />Unless otherwise indicated, Human Resources will take up references for the preferred candidate(s) following interview: Normally two employment references are required, references must include one from the candidate’s present or most recent employer. Where candidates only have one previous employer a character reference will be accepted as the second referee. All offers of appointment will be made subject to receipt of satisfactory references which are deemed satisfactory by QMU. If unsatisfactory references are received an offer of appointment may be withdrawn. <br /><br /><span class="lead">16.0 Notification to Successful Candidate</span> <br /><br />Having identified the preferred candidate the Chair of the Appointment Panel will agree the verbal offer with Human Resources and will then contact the successful candidate to advise them on the outcome of the recruitment process. At this stage any verbal offer of appointment made must be conditional as the appointment is dependent on receipt of satisfactory references, medical suitability, educational certificates and Disclosure Scotland Check or some other key requirement. The Chair of the panel should also discuss with the successful candidate the starting salary for the post and potential start date. <br /><br /><span class="lead">17.0 Letter of Offer Sent to Candidate</span> <br /><br />The formal offer of appointment together with the terms and conditions of employment will be issued from Human Resources and will be subject to the preemployment checks mentioned above. Once all of the pre-employment checks have been satisfactorily completed a letter will be sent to the candidate to confirm the offer of employment is unconditional.</p>
<p><span class="lead">18.0 Notification to Unsuccessful Applicants</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, decline emails will be sent once a verbal acceptance has been received from the successful candidate</li>
<li>Internal candidates should be advised of the outcome by telephone or in person by the Chair of the Appointment Panel. The Chair should pre-plan the discussion and focus on how the selection decision was reached. The candidate should be offered some positive feedback highlighting key strengths and suggesting development actions which would improve the candidate’s chances of being selected for a similar role in the future. HR will liaise with the Chair of the Appointment Panel to ensure feedback is provided in a fair and consistent manner. Normally it is recommended that feedback should be provided verbally by the Chair of the Appointment Panel however, HR can provide the feedback documented on the Competency Based Interview Schedule following an unsuccessful interview by arrangement with the Chair of the Appointment Panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">19.0 Successful Candidate Commences Employment</span> <br /><br />The final stage of the recruitment and selection process is for the new member of staff to commence employment with the University</p>
<ul>
<li>The critical part of this process is the induction a new employee receives from their manager into their new work environment – the key objective will be to ensure the new employee becomes familiar with their role and responsibilities and progress is monitored and reviewed. Line Managers are responsible for the new employee’s Induction Programme. They can access a Line Managers Handbook and Checklist (which should be adapted to suit local needs) from the HR intranet site</li>
<li>New employees are sent the QMU @ Work document with their contract, this can also be accessed from the HR intranet site</li>
<li>HR will book new employees onto the next available date for Corporate Induction. New Employees will be sent joining information for Corporate Induction before the event takes place.</li>
<li>New Employees should log onto Employee Self Service to review their annual leave entitlement. Guidance regarding Self Service is available from the HR intranet site <br /><br /></li>
