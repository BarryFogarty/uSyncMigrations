<p>All undergraduate applications received by the University are processed by the Admissions Office. Having submitted your application you should have received an official acknowledgement email which confirmed receipt of your application.</p>
<p>We aim to transmit a decision to you within 3-4 weeks of your application being received, however, at peak times this may be longer. Please note that in a number of courses where demand for places is high we often consider applications collectively after the deadline (the UCAS deadline for on time applications is 15th January).</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Receiving a decision</strong></span></p>
<p>Once your application has been considered an email informing you of the decision shall be sent to you. Your decision will also appear on UCAS hub. If successful we will send you further information and confirmation by email, so please notify UCAS and QMU if you change your contact details.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>What does your decision mean?</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are made an offer of a place on the course this offer shall be either Conditional or Unconditional. If you are not successful the decision will show as Reject on UCAS hub with the reason for the decision.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Conditional Offer</strong></span></p>
<p>If your offer is <strong>conditional</strong> this means that your place on the course is subject to you meeting specific conditions, such as meeting specific grade requirements for entry. If you decide to make Queen Margaret University your Conditional Firm choice through the UCAS website, your offer will remain conditional until you have satisfied the conditions made. In order to take up your place you must fulfil the conditions that have been set in your offer. Your offer will be changed to unconditional once all these conditions have been met.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Unconditional Offer</strong></span></p>
<p>If you receive an <strong>unconditional</strong> offer then you have satisfied all the academic requirements for entry to your chosen course. You may still be required to send evidence of the qualifications stated on your application to Admissions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 2 - Applicant Visit Days</strong></span></p>
<p>To help you decide whether you would like to accept our offer, the majority of students will be offered the chance to visit the campus, for a visit day. An invitation to attend your subject specific visit day will be emailed to you.</p>
<p>The visit day is an opportunity for you to tour the campus, discuss the academic programme with your course tutor, and the chance to meet current students and student service support staff. Subject to space, you are welcome to also bring along a friend or family member to the visit.</p>
<p>Visit days are usually held between February and April. If you are invited to an interview as part of the selection process (for Occupational Therapy, Nursing, Therapeutic and Diagnostic Radiography and Costume Design and Construction) then the visit day will be included in your interview programme.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 3 - Responding to your offer</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Accepting</strong></span></p>
<p>If you decide to make us your firm or insurance choice through UCAS, you are agreeing to our <a href="http://www.qmu.ac.uk/registry/ImportantInformation.htm">Terms and Conditions</a> . Please ensure that you read these before accepting your offer.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Declining</strong></span></p>
<p>We are sorry that you have decided not to take up your place at Queen Margaret University. We wish every success with your chosen course of study.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Deferring</strong></span></p>
<p>If you would like to defer your offer to the following academic year, please email admissions@qmu.ac.uk . We shall inform you of the Admissions Tutor's decision to you as soon as possible. Please be aware that deferral requests are not always approved, but you are welcome to submit a fresh application the following year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 4 – Prior to Entry</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>If your offer is Conditional -</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are sitting the following exams, then UCAS will automatically inform us of your results. If you are sitting any of these exams, then you do not have to send us copies of your exam grades unless we find that a result is missing. If this is the case, we will contact you directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQA (Scottish) qualifications</li>
<li>GCE and VCE A level and AS level</li>
<li>BTEC National Diploma</li>
<li>Irish Leaving Certificate</li>
<li>International Baccalaureate</li>
</ul>
<p>If your conditional offer is based on a qualification that is not listed above, then it is your responsibility to send a photocopy of your results to the Admissions Office. We especially advise applicants sitting Access courses or HNC/D courses, to send us or email copies of your results as soon as you receive them.</p>
<p>These results must be received by Admissions before <strong>31 August 2017</strong>, even if your offer is for entry in 2018.  </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>If your offer is Unconditional -</strong></span></p>
<p>If you decide to make Queen Margaret University your Unconditional Firm choice through your UCAS track website you should send in photocopies of the academic qualifications that you listed as having achieved on your UCAS form. These photocopies should be sent directly to the Admissions Office with your name and QMU Student Number written on them.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Send your results to the Admissions Team</strong></span></p>
<p>You can send in your results via email to <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk" title="Email Admissions Department">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can post copies to us at: Admissions Office, Queen Margaret University, Queen Margaret University Drive, Musselburgh, EH21 6UU</p>
<p>Once all your qualifications are confirmed by the Admissions team, a joining pack will be sent to you during the summer.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Disclosure/Police Check</strong></span></p>
<p>If you decide to accept our offer to study one of our Healthcare courses, you may be required to provide us with a satisfactory criminal record check. Please note that Queen Margaret University reserves the right to withdraw your offer if your criminal record is not acceptable.
