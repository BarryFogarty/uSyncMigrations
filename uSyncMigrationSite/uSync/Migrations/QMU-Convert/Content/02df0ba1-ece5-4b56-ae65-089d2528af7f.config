      <Value><![CDATA[<p>All primary research undertaken by staff and students at QMU requires the necessary ethical approval prior to commencing any data collection.  If you have queries about research ethics at QMU please email the Secretary to the University Research Ethics Committee via the <strong><a href="mailto:researchethics@qmu.ac.uk">Research Ethics email address</a></strong></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>How to apply </strong></span></p>
<p>All research studies conducted by staff and students at QMU requires ethical approval from the relevant QMU Divisional or University Research Ethics Committee (also known as DivREC or UREC).  Applicants are required to complete the standard research ethics application form and submit a research proposal/protocol. Depending on the type of study being undertaken, additional documentation may be required to support your application.  A checklist is included in the standard research ethics application form, and this will indicate if (and what) additional documents are required for inclusion with your submission.  </p>
<p>On completion of the research ethics application form and the necessary additional documentation, applications should be submitted to the appropriate committee for consideration.  <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3140b8369814e6585daa748d24710d6}" title="Research Ethics Committee Applications"><span class="blue-btn">Details of which committee you need to apply to</span></a></p>]]></Value>
