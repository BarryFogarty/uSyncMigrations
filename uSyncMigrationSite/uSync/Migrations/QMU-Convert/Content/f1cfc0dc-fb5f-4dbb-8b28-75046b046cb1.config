      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The plan follows the four “Cs” of incident management: <span class="lead">Confirm, Clear, Communicate, Control </span> </p>
<ul>
<li aria-setsize="-1" data-leveltext="•" data-font="Arial" data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><strong>Confirm</strong> – Is the person exhibiting signs/symptoms of COVID-19?    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-setsize="-1" data-leveltext="•" data-font="Arial" data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><strong>Clear</strong> – Isolate the person from others or isolate others from the person.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-setsize="-1" data-leveltext="•" data-font="Arial" data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><strong>Communicate</strong> - Inform key stakeholders that a suspected/confirmed COVID incident has occurred and of the actions that have been/are being taken.</li>
<li aria-setsize="-1" data-leveltext="•" data-font="Arial" data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><strong>Control</strong> – Restrict access to area where the person was working, studying or residing until cleaning can be arranged, and begin investigating where they may have been on campus to assist test and protect.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This plan is part of a broad range of mitigations put in place by the University to protect its community. This includes detailed information to students and to staff on self-administered Covid testing on a regular, twice weekly basis where asymptomatic. The guidance below relates to those instances where a member of the University community presents with symptoms, or reports a positive outcome as a result of self-administered or other form of test eg PCR.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead">ON CAMPUS</span></p>
<p><strong>Staff member with suspected symptoms of COVID-19</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If a staff member present on campus suspects they have symptoms of COVID-19, they must immediately inform Campus Operations (Security) on 2222 and follow the advice and guidance given. Security will remind the member of staff that they should contact their line manager and HR to advise that they have suspected Covid symptoms and that they have acted in line with the advice set out below. Line managers will also contact HR to ensure that such contact has been made.</li>
<li>The staff member will either be asked to remain where they are (if they are able to safely stay away from others), or they will be asked to move to an isolation room. At this point, if they are not already doing so, they must ensure they are wearing their face covering and limit what they touch.</li>
<li>A member of the Security team (the “incident first responder”) will attend the incident location, always making sure that they put on a face covering, disposable gloves and remain 2 metres from the staff member with suspected symptoms. If the staff member is not already doing so, the incident first responder will ask the staff member to wear their face covering.   The incident first responder will ask further questions to ascertain whether first aid or further medical advice is required, or if the staff member can safely get home to self-isolate.</li>
<li>A member of the Security Team will also ask questions on where the member of staff has been on campus and with whom they have been in close contact. In addition to information obtained from the member of staff, details of areas where they have swiped their staff smartcard will be obtained.</li>
<li>If the staff member has an injury or condition that is life threatening, the incident first responder, as a trained first aider, will immediately request help to dial 999 and obtain a DEFIB (if required).  All first aiders have received updated guidance on dealing with suspected COVID cases, but this will be reissued as part of this incident management plan.   </li>
<li>If they have an injury or condition that is non-life threatening, the incident first responder, as a trained first aider, will ask the staff member to self-treat their injury using the guidance and first aid provisions given to them by the incident first responder. This will allow a 2m safe distance to be maintained.</li>
<li>The staff member will be advised to contact NHS Inform to book a PCR test as soon as possible. Further information on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19/" title="NHS inform Covid information">booking tests is available from NHS inform</a>.</li>
<li>If they have driven, walked or cycled to campus, the staff member must exit the building via the least populated route and make their way home, ensuring they do not interact with other people.</li>
<li>If they have used public transport, they should follow the <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/transport-transition-plan/advice-on-how-to-travel-safely/#section-63888">Scottish Government guidance</a> on the use of public transport.</li>
<li>If they are not able to travel home by their own means, the process below should be followed (by the incident first responder) in the order set out:
<ul>
<li>It should be established if a household member can collect the staff member.</li>
<li>If not, and the staff member’s home is within travelling distance of the campus, arrangements should be made for a taxi to take them home using Central Taxis (approved for transporting symptomatic individuals home).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The member of staff and members of their household will be required to self-isolate, in line with <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19">NHS guidance</a>, The process from that point will depend on the results of the test</li>
<li>Once all the above steps are complete, the incident first responder will inform the duty Senior Management Team member, University Secretary, Director of Operations and Finance, Head of HR, H&amp;S Adviser and Campus Operations Manager and provide them with a copy of their report.  The process will require the incident first responder to upload the report to a folder. This will generate an alert to all relevant staff, advising them of the need to review the report.</li>
<li>As soon as possible, the Campus Operations Manager (or, in their absence, the senior duty member of the Campus Operations team) will arrange for any areas where the member of staff is known to have been to be closed off and cleaned in accordance with agreed protocols. </li>
<li>The staff member must inform the University of the outcome of the Covid-19 test by forwarding confirmation to Security and HR, and informing their line manager.</li>
<li>If the test is confirmed as negative, the staff member should follow the advice on their return to work. Security will confirm the incident as closed once confirmation is received via the incident report process above.</li>
<li>If the test is confirmed as positive, the member of staff must follow <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19">NHS guidance</a><a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19">,</a> on self isolation and contact tracing. The confirmed case section of the incident management plan will be implemented. The University will also implement contact tracing in accordance with the NHS Lothian HPT guidance at annex C. The member of staff may be asked to provide details of potential close contacts but should not contact individuals outwith their household directly.</li>
<li>Staff and students will be updated on cases in line with NHS Lothian HPT guidance.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the University is contacted by the media regarding a suspected case this should not be confirmed or denied and the suggested communication in annex A to this plan should be used.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Student with suspected symptoms of COVID-19</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If a student who is present on campus suspects they have symptoms of COVID-19, they must immediately inform Campus Operations (Security) on 2222 (internal phone number) or 0131 474 0000 (external number) or Accommodation Services (if they live on campus) and follow the advice and guidance given. The student should also advise the School Office (<a href="mailto:schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk">schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk</a>). It is preferable that the student uses their phone to contact staff, and that they do not physically present themselves to security or accommodation. </li>
<li>The student will either be asked to remain where they are (if they are able to safely stay away from others), or they will be asked to move to an isolation room. At this point they must ensure they are wearing their face covering and limit what they touch.</li>
<li>A member of the Security team (the “incident first responder”) will attend the incident location, and put on a face covering, disposable gloves and remain 2 metres from the student with suspected symptoms. If they are not already doing so, the student will be asked to wear their face covering. The incident first responder will ask further questions to ascertain whether first aid or further medical advice is required or if the student can safely get back to their accommodation or home to self-isolate.</li>
<li>A member of the Security team will also ask questions on where the student has been on campus and with whom they have been in close contact. If the student lives in accommodation on campus, the relevant Accommodation duty manager will be advised, and the student’s flatmates will be informed. In addition to information obtained from the students, details of areas where they have swiped their student smartcards will be obtained where this information is being collected, and the Students’ Union contacted to check for any test and protect details.</li>
<li>If the student has an injury or condition that is life threatening, the incident first responder, as a trained first aider, will immediately request help to dial 999 and obtain a DEFIB (if required). All first aiders have received updated guidance on dealing with suspected COVID cases, but this will be reissued as part of this incident management plan.   </li>
<li>If the student has an injury or condition that is non-life threatening, the incident first responder, as a trained first aider, will ask the student to self-treat their injury using the guidance and first aid provisions given to them by the incident first responder. This will allow a 2m safe distance to be maintained.</li>
<li>The student will be advised to contact NHS Inform to book a PCR test as soon as possible. Further information on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19/" title="NHS inform Covid information">booking tests is available from NHS inform</a>.</li>
<li>If the student is staying in accommodation on campus, the incident first responder will liaise directly with Accommodation Services to ensure that the student is supported and that the necessary mitigating actions are put in place to limit interaction with others.</li>
<li>If the student has driven, walked or cycled to campus, the student should exit the building via the least populated route, and make their way home, ensuring they do not interact with other people.</li>
<li>If they have used public transport, they should follow the <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/transport-transition-plan/advice-on-how-to-travel-safely/#section-63888">Scottish Government guidance</a> on the use of public transport.</li>
<li>If they are not able to travel home by their own means, the process below should be followed in the order set out:
<ul>
<li>It should be established whether a household member can collect them.</li>
<li>If not, and the student’s home is within travelling distance of the campus, a taxi should be arranged to take the student home using Central Taxis (approved for transporting symptomatic individuals' home).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the student lives in student accommodation on campus, assistance will be available, if required, to book a taxi to and from a testing site. The University will meet the cost of the taxi fare.</li>
<li>The student and others in their household will have to self-isolate in line with <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19">NHS guidance</a>. If the student lives in student accommodation on campus, Accommodation Services will also contact flatmates. If the incident occurs out of working hours, Security will perform this task. The process from that point will depend on the test result.</li>
<li>Once all the above steps are complete, the incident first responder will inform the duty Senior Leadership team member, University Secretary, Director of Operations and Finance , Health &amp; Safety Adviser, Head of Student Services, Campus Operations Manager and Accommodation Manager (if the student is resident on campus), and provide them with a copy of their report.  The process will require the incident first responder to upload the report to a folder. This will generate an alert to all relevant staff advising them of the need to review the report. This must include the School Office (contact <a href="mailto:schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk">schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk</a>); a member of School Office staff will record the student’s absence appropriately on the student records system as part of the central data collection and reporting.</li>
<li>As soon as possible, the Campus Operations Manager (or, in their absence, the senior duty member of the Campus Operations team) will arrange to close off any areas where the student is known to have been, and to arrange that it is cleaned in accordance with agreed protocols.</li>
<li>The student must advise the University of the outcome of the Covid-19 test by contacting Security. They must also contact Accommodation Services (if they live on campus) and the School Office.</li>
<li>If the test outcome is negative, Security will record the incident as closed once confirmation is received via the incident report process above.  The student may return to campus on confirmation of a negative test outcome.</li>
<li>If the test is positive the student must follow <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19">NHS guidance</a> on self-isolation and contact tracing. The University will also implement contact tracing as per the NHS Lothian HPT guidance. The student may be asked to provide details of potential close contacts but should not contact individuals outwith their household directly. The confirmed case section of the incident management plan will be implemented.</li>
<li>Staff and students will be updated on cases in line with NHS Lothian HPT guidance.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>If the University is contacted by the media regarding a suspected case this should not be confirmed or denied and the suggested communication in annex A to this plan should be used.</p>
<p>In order to provide additional background information on suspected cases, Accommodation Services, in liaison with Security, should log all incidents that they attend related to breaches of Covid guidelines.</p>
<p>If a student needs support or advice at any stage in the process, they should contact Student Services in the first instance.</p>
<p><strong>Staff member/Student is asymptomatic on campus but records a positive result from a self-administered lateral flow tes</strong>t</p>
<p>If a staff member/student registers a positive result from a self-administered lateral flow test, the staff member or student should call Security on 0131 474 0000 to inform of the positive LFD outcome. The student should also advise the School Office (<a href="mailto:schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk">schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk</a>). The incident management protocol for dealing with this will follow the steps set out above on the basis that the staff member/student has presented with the virus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead">OFF CAMPUS</span></p>
<p><strong>Staff member/Student becomes symptomatic while off campus/at home</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Staff and Students should access information and symptoms checker online at <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a><a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">.</a> They can also arrange to book a test or order a home test. If they are unable to access this service online, they should call 0800 028 2816. </li>
<li>The Staff member or Student should call QMU Security on 0131 474 0000 to inform them of their symptoms and the advice given by NHS Inform. The student should also advise the School Office (<a href="mailto:schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk">schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk</a>).</li>
<li>If advised to self-isolate and book a test, Security will ask the staff member/student when they were last on campus (last 48hrs) and what areas they visited.</li>
<li>Once all the above steps are complete, Security will inform the duty Senior Leadership Team member, the Head of HR (in the case of a member of staff) , Health &amp; Safety Adviser, Campus Operations Manager and, where relevant, the Accommodation Manager, Student Services and School Office, and provide them with a copy of their report.  The process will require the member of the Security team to upload the report to a folder. This will generate an e-mail to all relevant staff, advising them of the need to review the report. </li>
<li>As soon as possible, the Campus Operations Manager (or, in their absence, the senior duty member of the Campus Operations team) will arrange for any areas where the student or member of staff is known to have been to be closed off and cleaned in accordance with agreed protocols.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a student needs support or advice at any stage in the process, they should contact Student Services in the first instance.</p>
<p><strong>Staff member/Student is asymptomatic while off campus/at home, but has a positive result from a self-administered lateral flow test</strong></p>
<p>If a staff member/student registers a positive result from a self-administered lateral flow test, the staff member or student should call Security on 0131 474 0000 to inform of the positive LFD outcome and the advice given by NHS Inform. The student should also advise the School Office (<a href="mailto:schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk">schooloffice@qmu.ac.uk</a>).

We will aim to keep our communications simple. We will not overdo frequency of communications as this can make people indifferent to important information when it is published and distract the Incident Team from substantive action. </p>\n<p>             </p>\n<p><strong>Draft statement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In the event of an outbreak of confirmed and suspected cases (if there were speculation or we are contacted by the media). </strong></p>\n<p>NB: We will not comment on individual cases but would issue the statement below if required.</p>\n<p>We have well established processes in place to mitigate against, but also to respond to reports of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our student and staff population. This includes issuing targeted communication as appropriate. Our processes adhere to guidance from Health Protection Scotland. Alongside this, of course, everyone in the University community should follow NHS’s advice to help avoid the spread of coronavirus.  </p>\n<p><strong>In the event of an outbreak, communication to staff and students would be along the following lines (any final statement would be agreed between QMU and NHS Lothian Communications)</strong></p>\n<p>A number of members of our University community have tested positive for COVID-19. In line with our well established Incident Management arrangements, we are working closely with NHS Lothian Health Protection Team to monitor and to manage the situation, following all national guidance.</p>\n<p>In line with that, a number of people have been contacted because they have been identified as having been in close and sustained contact with those affected, and they are being provided with appropriate support and guidance.</p>\n<p><strong>Unless you have been contacted, you should continue to attend classes/work on campus as normal.</strong></p>\n<p>The University has a robust approach in place to monitor and mitigate the impact of coronavirus. The campus remains very much open for business as usual, with sensible precautions in place.</p>\n<p>If you have any concerns in the meantime, or if you need to book a COVID-19 test because you have developed symptoms (high temperature, a new continuous cough and/or a loss or change in sense of smell or taste) please visit the <a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19\">NHS Inform</a> website or for non-clinical advice call 0800 028 2816.

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This section of the communicable disease management plan details the immediate actions that must be taken when there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 amongst our staff, students or visitors, on or off campus.</p>
<p>It is designed to be an easy-to-follow set of steps, but it is also recognised that further detailed steps may need to be taken that are associated with specific individual circumstances.</p>
<p>Please note - if a student contacts a member of staff as a result of them being asked to self-isolate, the student should be directed to the University’s FAQs in the first instance.   </p>
