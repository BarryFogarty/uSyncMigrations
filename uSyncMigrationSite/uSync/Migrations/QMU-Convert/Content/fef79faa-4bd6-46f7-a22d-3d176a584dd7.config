Our campus, recognised as an exemplar in sustainability within the higher education sector nationally and internationally, is a physical example of our commitment to sustainability and is the foundation upon which our vision and strategy for sustainability continue to develop. The campus has become an intrinsic part of the University’s brand, and is a significant attraction for students, parents and staff. It has supported greatly progress towards fulfilling our vision of being a university of ideas and influence. Airy and bright, it offers a real community feel, with ready access to student services, food outlets, student accommodation, sports facilities, beautiful grounds, and plenty of places for socialising. The Students’ Union also occupies a building on site.</p>\n<p>Looking to the future, we recognise many opportunities for the further development of our estate, including the development of the Edinburgh Innovation Park on the land next to our campus as part of the Edinburgh &amp; South East Scotland City Region Deal. Last summer it was confirmed that Government funding of £30 million has been pledged to contribute towards this joint development by QMU and East Lothian Council, which forms part of a broader masterplan including a commercial hub on campus.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
