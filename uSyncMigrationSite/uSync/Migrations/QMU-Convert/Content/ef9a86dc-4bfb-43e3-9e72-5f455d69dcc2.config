<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This report is about the help available to consumers who have experienced a problem with a business that they have been unable to resolve on their own. Some of these problems end up in the small claims courts, but increasingly consumers can turn to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) schemes. This report is about the UK’s current approach to ADR.</p>
<p>The report does 3 things. It provides an up-to-date map of ADR schemes available to consumers in the UK. It presents a detailed comparative assessment of a small selection of these schemes. And it sets out consumer insights drawn from interviews with consumers who have used ADR. The research presented in this report involved desk-based internet research, interviews with ADR schemes, and interviews with consumers.</p>
<p>The report comes at a crucial time. There have been longstanding criticisms of ADR provision for consumers and there is wide consensus that the system is incoherent and confusing. The current government has an opportunity to address some of these criticisms in a forthcoming Consumer Green Paper.</p>
<p>This is, therefore, an opportune time to be thinking about how to ensure that ADR meets consumers’ needs and serves their interests.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Our conclusions</span></p>
<p>Three core messages arise from the research.</p>
<p><strong>The ADR landscape is confusing for consumers​.</strong> There are now more ADR schemes than ever. While this is not a problem in itself and has improved coverage, it has further added to the complexity facing consumers. And there remain significant gaps and overlaps. Where there are gaps, consumers are left without remedy. Where there are overlaps, consumers are left confused. The wide variety of ADR processes and inconsistent terminology are also a source of confusion.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>The current ADR landscape is not designed with consumers’ needs in mind​.</strong> Except where ADR is mandatory, businesses have the power both to decide whether to take part in ADR and, if so, which ADR scheme to use. In some sectors, multiple ADR schemes compete with each other. The result is that consumers’ needs are not being met. Often consumers do not know where to complain.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Improving ADR provision is hampered by a lack of good quality data​</strong>. Simply describing the UK’s ADR landscape is a complex task. Information is not readily available and there is significant variation between ADR schemes in terms of transparency. Lack of good quality comparative data makes tackling the shortfalls in ADR provision more difficult. It also means that feedback loops that might improve business practice are less likely to be present. Overall, it means that ensuring consumer needs are met is difficult to assess and assure.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Recommendations</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>To address the areas for improvement identified in this report, we make 6 recommendations.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Recommendation 1: mandatory ADR should be extended across all consumer sectors</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Significant gaps continue to exist where businesses choose not to sign up to an ADR scheme. The government should adopt the principle that participation in ADR should be mandatory across all consumer sectors, regardless of the sector involved or the value of the claims consumers are making. This should be monitored and reviewed if credible evidence emerges that the system is being abused. There are certain areas that may require special attention in relation to this recommendation including the private rented sector and consumer-to-consumer transactions.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Recommendation 2: in regulated sectors, ADR should be limited to 1 provider in each sector.</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In regulated sectors, it is particularly important that the different actors (regulator, consumer advocate and ombudsman) work closely together. Therefore we recommend that there should be only 1 ADR provider per sector.</p>
<p>The potential benefits of competition in terms of raising standards can be maintained, for example by regularly inviting tenders for the contract to provide the ADR scheme.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Recommendation 3: in non-regulated sectors, BEIS should take steps to make the ADR landscape easier for consumers to navigate.</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This can be done in a way that tackles gaps and overlaps in the ADR landscape at the same time as preserving standard-raising competition.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In non-regulated areas, should ADR become mandatory, we recommend that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) work with industries and key stakeholders to make ADR more user-friendly. BEIS should consider whether having 1 ADR provider per sector is the right solution for consumers. As a minimum, there should be a single branded entry point for consumers wishing to make a complaint, with consumers shielded from ‘background’ competition.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Recommendation 4: ADR should be branded more consistently.</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>There is a wide variety of ADR types and processes available and a lack of clarity over terminology. In order to consolidate ADR as a key means by which consumer disputes are resolved, ADR needs to develop a clear, common, and well-known brand. Recent years have seen an increase in the number of ADR schemes branding themselves as ombudsman schemes. This may provide a starting point for a more consistently branded ADR offer.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Recommendation 5: ADR schemes should harmonise their practices wherever it is in the consumer interest to do so.</span></p>
<p>BEIS should work with the industry and key stakeholders to harmonise practice across ADR schemes. For example, consumers should be able to expect similar levels of procedural fairness and support in making a complaint regardless of the ADR scheme they are complaining to. The diversity of process and practice between ADR schemes is confusing for many consumers. While there is no need for identical processes to operate, without some common approaches and terminology, it will not be possible to develop common standards, benchmarks, and reporting requirements.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Recommendation 6: a single authoritative body should be tasked with setting common performance standards, benchmarks, and reporting requirement for all ADR schemes</span></p>
<p>While some positive developments in performance standards are already taking place, there is a need for more action. In particular, agreed benchmarks and common reporting requirements across all ADR schemes would make it easier to compare performance and raise standards. Having a single authoritative body with oversight of the ADR sector would also ensure that quality is maintained.</p>
<div class="page">

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Research method</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The research methods involved desk research, interviews, and a survey. The research took place in 3 phases and was supplemented by YouGov polling data.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: mapping exercise​.</strong> We undertook a desk-based mapping exercise in order to provide a snapshot of the current number and type of ADR schemes in the UK. The mapping exercise used publicly available information from ADR schemes’ websites. The mapping exercise also drew on previous analyses of ADR in the UK. Overall, the mapping exercise allowed us to provide an up-to-date map of the UK’s ADR landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2: comparative analysis of selected ADR schemes​.</strong> The second phase of the research involved comparing 11 ADR schemes using a framework developed in previous research commissioned by Citizens Advice. This framework features 8 criteria that allow ADR schemes to be compared. Our analysis was based on information publicly available on the websites of ADR schemes and follow-up telephone interviews with knowledgeable individuals within the schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3: consumer experiences of using ADR schemes​.</strong> The final phase of the research involved conducting 37 telephone interviews with consumers who had recently used an ADR scheme. The interviews sought to gather consumer perspectives on using ADR. These data provide an insight into consumer experiences and bring consumer perspectives to practitioners and policymakers.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Finally, as an additional aspect of the research, YouGov were commissioned to conduct a nationally representative survey of 2,109 people. The survey sought to obtain the views of the general public rather than those who had used ADR schemes (only 34 out of the 2,109 people surveyed had used ADR). The highlights of the survey are added throughout the report. A fuller summary of the methodology is available in Appendix B.</p>
<p>The research team would like to thank all the ADR schemes and consumers who took part in this research. Their assistance was much appreciated.</p>

<p> Through the Citizens Advice Consumer Service we advised on more than 400,000 consumer complaints over the past 12 months. The complaints we see vary from defective second-hand cars to substandard service from an energy provider. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) can offer an inexpensive and effective solution to individual consumer disputes, as an alternative to courts. ​For many consumers, non-court-based schemes may be the only realistic option to resolve these disputes.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Yet while some ADR mechanisms work well, previous Citizens Advice research on Complaints Handling suggests that many consumers have limited or no options for redress. The overall ADR landscape is patchy, with gaps, weaknesses and overlaps in coverage. This varied landscape leads to inconsistent results for consumers. In some cases, gaps make it hard for consumers to act on their statutory rights to redress.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>We wanted to explore this idea further, to get an in-depth understanding of ADR provision across consumer markets. To do this we commissioned Queen Margaret University’s Consumer Dispute Resolution Centre and the University of Westminster to compare the performance of ADR schemes across a wide range of consumer markets. We asked, do ADR schemes meet consumer expectations and deliver the best customer outcomes? This report is timely - in a forthcoming Consumer Green Paper, the government has an opportunity to address some of the inadequacies of ADR provision and consumer redress more generally.</p>
<p>The recommendations set out in this report bring together the academic expertise of the research team with Citizens Advice’s consumer knowledge. By building a picture of the UK’s current ADR landscape, its problems and its gaps, the research has led us to solutions for improving the use and outcomes of ADR for consumers. They set out how we can achieve a simpler, clearer and more accessible ADR landscape.</p>
