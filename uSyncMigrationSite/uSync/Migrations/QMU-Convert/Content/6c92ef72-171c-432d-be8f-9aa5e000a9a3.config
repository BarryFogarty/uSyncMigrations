      "content": "<p><strong>3.1</strong> Users must produce a valid QMU Smart Card whenever they wish to borrow.</p>\n<p><strong>3.2</strong> QMU Smart Cards are not transferable.</p>\n<p><strong>3.3</strong> Items may be removed from the LRC without first being formally issued as a loan. Any removal or attempted removal of an item without complying with this procedure constitutes an offence and renders the user liable to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p><strong>3.4</strong> Users will be held responsible for all items issued on their QMU Smart Card until they are returned to the LRC and duly discharged.</p>\n<p><strong>3.5</strong> Books and other items of LRC stock which have been issued on a QMU Smart Card may not be transferred from one LRC user to another.</p>\n<p><strong>3.6</strong> Current loan periods must be observed at all times, and items returned by the date and time specified.</p>\n<p><strong>3.7</strong> It is the responsibility of the user to return all items by dates and times specified. Reminder notices are a courtesy, not an entitlement.</p>\n<p><strong>3.8</strong> Email will be the standard means by which communications from the LRC are delivered. Email will only be sent to a QMU email address.</p>\n<p><strong>3.9</strong> When returning items, these must be discharged at the Self Service facility or handed to a member of LRC staff during staffed hours. Users returning LRC materials, issued on their QMU Smart Card, must not leave them unattended in the LRC, whether at the LRC Service Desk, or anywhere else in the LRC. LRC materials remain the responsibility of the user until they are duly discharged and it is the responsibility of the user to check the screen and make sure that items are discharged from their record.</p>\n<p><strong>3.10</strong> Fines are levied on all users for the late return of items. Users who fail to return items will be invoiced for the accumulated fines, the cost of replacement and an administration charge. Users who have such an 'account' on their QMU Smart Card will have their borrowing privileges suspended until all accounts are cleared to the satisfaction of the Head of Learning Services.</p>\n<p><strong>3.11</strong> University users who are in debt to the LRC, due to non-payment of fines or through failure to clear accounts on their LRC record, by the end of their programme may have their degree certificate withheld and/or will not be allowed to graduate.</p>\n<p><strong>3.12</strong> If not required by other users, most items may be renewed for a further period. Items can be renewed at the Self Service facility, in person at the Service Desk, by telephone or electronically via the LRC online catalogue. Please note that, under the Data Protection Act, telephone renewals can only be carried out by the person who originally borrowed the items.</p>\n<p><strong>3.13</strong> A reservation or 'hold' may be placed on most items that are currently on loan. Users will be notified when the item becomes available and it will be held for 'pickup' for 7 days.</p>\n<p><strong>3.14</strong> Users will be notified if any item issued on their QMU Smart Card is required by another user. These items will no longer be eligible for renewal and must be returned by the date and time specified.</p>\n<p><strong>3.15</strong> Any user who fails to return a book, knowing that it is in demand, may be required to pay the costs of replacing it and will be liable to suspension of further borrowing privileges.</p>\n<p><strong>3.16</strong> Lost or stolen QMU Smart Cards must be reported to Security and to the LRC immediately. There is a £20 charge for the replacement of lost cards.</p>"

Failure to produce a valid QMU Smart Card may result in the user being asked to leave the LRC.</p>\n<p><strong>4.4</strong> For health and safety reasons, children under 12 will only be admitted to the LRC if they are kept under the close supervision of an adult.</p>\n<p><strong>4.5</strong> Silence in areas designated as Silent or Quiet Study Areas must be observed. Mobile phones and other devices must be switched to silent in these areas.</p>\n<p><strong>4.6</strong> LRC staff are empowered to remove unattended bags to the LRC Workroom.

The University accepts no responsibility for such equipment or for data stored.</p>\n<p><strong>4.11</strong> The University accepts no responsibility for loss or theft of, or damage to, personal belongings left anywhere in the LRC.</p>\n<p><strong>4.12</strong> No book or other item of LRC stock may be removed from the LRC unless it has been issued via the Self Service facility or at Service Desk.</p>\n<p><strong>4.13</strong> The LRC has electronic security systems to prevent the unauthorised removal of LRC materials. Users must comply with the requirements of their operation.</p>\n<p><strong>4.14</strong> LRC staff can ask that bags, briefcases and all other containers be opened, to check for LRC materials being taken out of the LRC, whether or not the security system has been activated.</p>\n<p><strong>4.15</strong> Users must leave the LRC immediately on hearing the fire alarm or when required to do so in any emergency. LRC users must comply with directions given by Fire Wardens and Fire Marshals.</p>"

Users must return the item(s), pay any fines due (where applicable to the category of user), and pay an administration cost to clear the account.</p>\n<p>If any item(s), issued on a QMU Smart Card have been lost or stolen, the user must pay the replacement cost of the item(s), any fines (where applicable) and the administration cost.
