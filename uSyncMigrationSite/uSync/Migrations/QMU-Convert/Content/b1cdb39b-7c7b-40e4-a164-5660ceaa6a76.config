      "title": "Major programme change",
      "content": "<p>5.2     Major programme changes involve substantial revision and reformulation of a programme, or part of a programme. Changes may include those that significantly affect the programme’s awards, philosophy, aims and objectives, learning, teaching and assessment strategy, overall structure or its management. A major change is determined by the nature and impact of the proposed revision and not by the number of modules or credit value involved. Examples of major change might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Significant change to the overall programme aims and/or learning outcomes that impact on curriculum, assessment and other aspects of the student experience;</li>\n<li>Any significant change resulting from PSRB requirements or other changes in the external environment, for example requirement to embed additional material in the curriculum across a number of core modules;</li>\n<li>Change to the assessment pattern for a number of modules where these collectively significantly alter the overall student workload, underpinning learning experience or variety of assessment components;</li>\n<li>Change to the structure of the programme which results in the student experience being significantly altered, for example merging a number of modules, adding a number of new modules or addition of an extended placement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that a change from face-to-face to distance learning delivery will normally be via the major change route rather than a full review. This does not apply for collaborative programmes, which require a full review event for change in mode of delivery.</p>\n<p>5.3     Programme Leaders putting forward changes that affect the programme as a whole, or a number of modules contributing to the programme, are required to consult with the Assistant Secretary, Governance and Quality Enhancement, who can advise on whether a major change event is required. Advice must also be sought on the process to follow in the event of a requested programme title change.</p>\n<p>5.4     Major programme changes are usually implemented at the start of an academic session and normally addressed at review events. However, they may also occur between reviews, and if so, should follow the steps detailed below.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 – Approval from Dean of School and notification to Governance and Quality Enhancement</strong></p>\n<p>5.5       The Dean of School should approve the Team’s request to proceed with the major change. Once approved, the Programme Leader should notify staff of the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement so a date can be agreed.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 – The major change process</strong></p>\n<p>5.6     After the proposal has been approved by the Dean of School and a date has been agreed with staff of the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement, the major programme change will go forward for validation. A full event may not be necessary for a major programme change between reviews. However, peer scrutiny of the proposed changes will be required. In such cases, it may be possible for approval to be given by correspondence. If a full event is deemed necessary, all procedures as detailed in paragraph 8 below will apply, with the following modifications.</p>\n<p>5.7       As a minimum, the Panel will include two internal staff, where possible from different Schools, one of whom meets the criteria for Convener and one of whom meets the criteria for internal panellist. There will also be one external with a professional and academic background. Where possible, panellists will be those involved in the original validation or most recent review.</p>\n<p>5.8       The documentary requirements are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A summary of proposed changes, including the rationale for presenting major changes between review events;</li>\n<li>Evidence of consultation with students and other stakeholders;</li>\n<li>A statement on transitional arrangements for continuing students;</li>\n<li>Other supporting documentation as appropriate and advised by staff of the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement, for example module descriptors;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Step 3 – Final approval</strong></p>\n<p>5.9     A report will be prepared and provided to the Student Experience Committee, Senate and School Academic Board as set out in paragraphs 3.25 to 3.27 above.</p>\n<p>5.10    The Programme Leader must submit a revised Definitive Programme Document and Programme Specification to the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement to replace the previous versions.</p>"

The correct approval route is determined by the nature and impact of the modification. Further information is given in the table under paragraph 5.27.</p>\n<p>In the event that a number of module descriptors are being changed in such a way as to affect the structure, aims or overall assessment philosophy of the programme, then it may be considered a major programme change and paragraphs 5.2 – 5.10 will apply.</p>\n<p>5.12     PSRBs will typically need to approve any changes to programmes leading to accreditation or registration. Early consultation with the relevant PSRB is necessary to determine the sequence of events, in particular whether QMU or PSRB approval should be sought first, or whether these processes happen in parallel.</p>\n<p>5.13     The views of students affected by minor modification(s) must normally be sought prior to introducing any changes to the regulations for the assessment or progression of students. Programme Teams are also expected to consult the External Examiner whenever possible about any changes to modules and programmes.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Adding/replacing with a new module</strong></p>\n<p>5.14     To add a new module to a validated programme, the Programme Committee should submit the relevant module descriptor and a module change form to the relevant Programme Committee and School Academic Board for approval. If the new module is replacing an existing module, the existing module descriptor should also be attached.</p>\n<p>5.15    The School Academic Board has the authority to refer new modules back to  the relevant Programme Committee where it feels that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insufficient information is included in the module descriptor, or insufficient explanation provided of the reasons for the change;</li>\n<li>Discussion has not involved all key stakeholders;</li>\n<li>The number or nature of changes proposed within a particular programme requires to be considered collectively as a major change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Adding/replacing with an imported module</strong></p>\n<p>5.16    Imported modules (i.e. modules from another QMU programme, or modules from another institution) do not normally require re-validation but their function in the programme under consideration must be approved. Where an imported module is presented as part of the curriculum for the validation of a new programme, the validation Panel should consider only the appropriateness of the module within the context of the named award. It is not necessary to re-validate the module, except where it has to be modified to fit the new award.</p>\n<p>5.17    Imported modules from within the University should follow the same procedures as those in paragraphs 5.14 and 5.15 above.</p>\n<p>5.18     Modules may occasionally be imported from other institutions, following the same procedures as those in paragraph 5.14 and 5.15 above. However, the general academic validity of modules from Scottish Higher Education Institutions should be accepted and only the appropriateness of the module within the context of the named award should be considered.</p>\n<p>5.18    Normally, if individual students wish to use credit from certificated learning at another institution this will be dealt with through the University’s procedures for Recognition of Prior Learning. Details, including a module descriptor and transcript should be provided for consideration by the relevant Board of Examiners.</p>\n<p><strong>Withdrawing a module</strong></p>\n<p>5.20     To withdraw a module without replacing it, the Programme Committee must submit the module change form and a copy of the module descriptor to the relevant School Academic Board, or sub-committee, for approval. The School Academic Board will need confirmation that all programmes and students accessing the module have been informed and that alternative arrangements can be put in place.</p>\n<p><strong>Module change</strong></p>\n<p>5.21     Most module changes can be approved by the Programme Committee and reported to the School Academic Board. For collaborative programmes, this responsibility rests with the Joint Board of Studies.</p>\n<p>5.22     A summary of types of module change and the usual route for approval is provided below. The Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement can provide guidance on the examples below, and other types of module change not listed in the table.</p>\n<p>5.2.3    Changes agreed by the Programme Committee must be reported to the School Academic Board through the minutes of the Programme Committee or Joint Board of Studies and/or highlighted on a cover sheet. In most cases, the School Academic Board will note the changes without discussion. If a proposed change has an impact on another programme that accesses the module as an elective, the notification to the School Academic Board should allow enough time for this to be highlighted and any consequences addressed before the next iteration of the module.</p>\n<p>5.24     If a module change needs to come to the School Academic Board, the Programme Committee must submit the old and new module descriptors along with the module change form for approval.</p>\n<p>5.25     If the Programme Committee or School Academic Board recommends approval of the module change then it will be reported to Student Records and the Academic Administration by the Secretary to the Committee or Board.</p>\n<p>5.26     Normally any module changes will take effect in the next academic year. The Programme Team is responsible for ensuring that all students are informed of the change(s) once agreed.</p>\n<p>5.27     The Programme Leader is responsible for incorporating any approved changes into the Definitive Programme Document.</p>\n<p><strong>Committee responsibility for module changes</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"229\">\n<p><strong>Type of change</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th width=\"151\">\n<p><strong>Programme Committee</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th width=\"119\">\n<p><strong>School Academic Board</strong></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Module Co-ordinator name</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>For noting</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>N/A</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Member of teaching team</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>-</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>N/A</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Texts/reading list</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Notify library only</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>N/A</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Pre-requisites/co-requisites</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>N/A</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Formative assessments<a name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\"><span>[1]</span></a></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>N/A</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Minor changes/clarifications to wording of learning outcomes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>N/A</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Minor changes to delivery pattern and learning experiences</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>N/A</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Major change to pattern of delivery – e.g. from classroom to distance learning, weekly to week block</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>A change in assessment weighting of no more than 10% (e.g. from 80/20 to 60/40)</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>For noting</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>A change to word length of an assignment or duration of an exam of no more than 25% (e.g. from 2 hours to 2.5)</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>For noting</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Change to semester of delivery</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>For noting</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Module Title</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>For noting</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Addition or removal of learning outcomes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Change to assessment format or pattern</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>A change in assessment weighting of greater than 10% (eg from 80/20 to 50/50)</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Significant change to word length or exam duration (more than 25%) (e.g. from 2 hours to 3)</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Addition or removal of assessment component</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Change in credit value</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>New module</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"229\">\n<p>Module withdrawal</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"151\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"119\">\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span>[1]</span></a> The University does not require teams to specify formative assessments on module descriptors.
