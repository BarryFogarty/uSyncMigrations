The representation may be made in person or in writing, as the student chooses, and may be put forward by the student or by the student's adviser, friend or representative. In cases deemed to be urgent by the Principal, a student may be suspended or excluded with immediate effect. An opportunity will be given to the student to make representation as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>\n<p><strong>4.6</strong> A decision to suspend a student, or to exclude a student from academic activities associated with the student's programme of study, shall be subject to review at the request of the student after four weeks. Such a review will not involve a hearing, but the student, either personally or through his or her adviser, friend or representative, will be entitled to make written representation. The Principal will conduct the review.</p>\n<p><strong>4.7</strong> In addition to the initial review, the Principal shall review the suspension or exclusion on receipt of evidence of altered circumstances that might affect the order.</p>\n<p><strong>4.8</strong> A student may appeal against an order of suspension or exclusion using the process set out under section 9 of these Regulations.</p>"

Normally the student will have to tell the Ombudsman about his/her complaint within 12 months of first knowing about the problem about which they are complaining, although the Ombudsman may look at complaints outside this limit, if she thinks there is good reason to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>10.3</strong> There are some restrictions on what the Ombudsman can investigate. For example, she cannot consider the subject matter of complaints about personnel matters or matters of academic judgement. However, she may be able to investigate the manner in which the complaint was handled. If the complaint is appropriate to her office and is investigated, the Ombudsman’s staff will send details of how this will be done.</p>\n<p><strong>10.4</strong> The complaint should be submitted in writing to the Ombudsman, and should include any relevant documents including correspondence with the University and the University’s response to the complaint. This can be sent to the Ombudsman without cost at the freepost address given below. A student may discuss the complaint with an Investigator at the SPSO before deciding to submit.</p>\n<p><strong>10.5</strong> The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman has an online complaint form accessible through the website although papers in support of the complaint would still have to be supplied to the Ombudsman by post or other means. The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman can also supply paper complaint forms direct to complainants.</p>\n<p><strong>10.6</strong> Further information may be accessed through the <a href=\"https://www.spso.org.uk/\" title=\"Scottish Public Services Ombudsman website\">Scottish Public Services Ombudsman website</a> or by calling her office for advice.
