      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this handbook is to bring together the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of practice-based learning</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">An overview of roles and responsibilities of the student and supporting staff while on placement</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Information on content and structure for each programme</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">An insight into the expectations of practice-based learning.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the same way as university-based modules, the Hub@QMU plays a crucial role in the support of students’ learning and in the storage of relevant information.  There is one generic practice-based learning Hub site which will have information common to all students, as well as programme and level specific areas. This must be read in conjunction with this handbook.</p>
<p>Information on geographical locale of specific placements is not included in this handbook, but can be accessed via the Hub alongside copies of the relevant placement assessment forms and details of any additional assessment or university based activities.</p>
<p>Whilst perhaps not reading it all at once, students are required to read the content of this document and should be able to access it throughout their practice based learning placements.</p>
<p>The PBL team wish all students well in their studies, and hope they find practice-based learning both stimulating and challenging.</p>]]></Value>

      "content": "<p>Placements are full-time blocks of study in a variety of speciality and geographical areas.  Across the board the placements will be varied, each with their own unique challenges and flavours. Through each placement students will be supported by one or more Practice Educators - an experienced member of staff who will act as mentor, facilitator, and assessor. Historically these individuals have been termed “supervisors” but this term wholly underestimates the complexity of the role they will have in students’ learning and professional development and they are now known as Practice Educators (PE).</p>\n<p>Your first experience starts with a two-week foundation placement which allows students to view the professional and clinical world, giving some exposure to key professional issues.  You will then complete four 5 or 6 week placements and an elective placement (subject to COVID related programme changes)</p>\n<p>The typical placement pattern is shown below – but this can be subject to change depending on placement availability.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 34px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\">MPhys or BSc programme</th>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\">\n<p>Year 1: Foundation placement</p>\n<p>Year 2: Placement 1</p>\n<p>Year 3: Placement 2 and 3</p>\nYear 4: Placement 4 and elective</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\">MSc pre-reg programme</th>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 17px;\">\n<p>Year 1: Foundation placement and placement 1 and 2</p>\nYear 2: Placement 3, 4 and elective</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The practice-based Learning (PBL) programme is designed to allow the student to work towards independent practice and learning as the course develops. The learning outcomes for the 4 six-week placements are completed with set ‘Attributes of performance’.  For MPhys and BSc students these levels increase as the progress through their course. For MSc pre-reg students these placements are all at the same level – equivalent to that of the level 4 learning outcomes within the BSc Honours or MPhys Physiotherapy Programme. It would be impossible for a student in the early stages of their professional development and learning to be able to demonstrate professional “mastery”.</p>\n<p> </p>"

However it is recognised that there will be occasions when attendance at placement would be not advisable due to ill health. In this case you should NOT attend placement until fit to do so and supply either a self-certification form (on the Portal) if absent for 5 days or fewer or a medical certificate if you are absent for over 5 days.  You may still be permitted to be assessed for placement if your absence has not significantly impacted on your placement learning experience and outcomes (usually seen as sickness absences totalling 6 days or fewer on a 6 week placement). If you have 3 absences for sickness (either within a single placement or cumulatively over the course of all of your placements) you will be asked to attend a meeting with relevant university staff (Your PAT, the programme lead and / or module coordinator as appropriate) to discuss these absences and make relevant plans as appropriate. </p>\n<p>If you are aware of an expected absence on placement (examples in the past have included attendance at a funeral or an international sporting commitment) this MUST be discussed with the module coordinator AND programme lead as soon as possible prior to the absence. If your absence is agreed, then the hours not at placement will not be counted as available placement hours. Such absence requests will be assessed on an individual case by case basis by the University staff and you must abide by the decisions made regarding attendance at placement. Failure to do so will be seen as unprofessional behaviour and result in a Fail in that component of your placement assessment. Should a student’s absence on placement bring them below this 100% target, discussion will be held between the practice educator, the personal academic tutor and the module co-ordinator to decide the course of action.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong><u>It is the students responsibility</u></strong> to ensure that any absence that is agreed with QMU is also discussed with your educator to ensure that it doesn’t place additional demands on your placement (such as rescheduling patients) prior to the absence. If you become aware your absence would cause issues at the placement site you must discuss your absence further with your PAT, programme lead or module coordinator.</p>\n<p>Absences due to required meetings, examinations or attendance at assessments within the University will not be counted as available placement hours. For examinations etc. this will be for the day of the exam only and further absence MUST be discussed with QMU.</p>\n<p>Students are reminded that in all instances you may wish to consider whether extenuating circumstances regulations are applicable and would be more appropriate for your circumstances regarding placement absence. </p>"

      "title": "The student and Practice Educator",
      "content": "<p>On placement, students are required to work very closely with their practice educator. Communication is paramount in establishing a good working relationship and it is important that students be open with the practice educator in discussion about their hopes for the placement and how the placement is progressing. Practice educators appreciate feedback on the progress of the placement as much as students and it will assist students in achieving their goals and objectives from the learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Remember that although practice educators may have many skills and attributes, mind reading is not among them! </strong>Students are requested to express their thought processes when discussing patients or planning their day. This will help the practice educator to understand the student’s learning needs and enable a more tailored placement. It will also allow students to demonstrate their clinical thinking and reasoning and also further their learning. It is also important to understand that the practice educator’s first responsibility is to their patients and that in addition to facilitating the student’s learning, they have many other responsibilities to deal with on a day-to-day basis. Giving consideration and thought to their needs and responsibilities will go a long way in establishing a good level of communication.</p>\n<p><strong>A student must have realistic expectations about their level of clinical performance in each placement.  The A grade indicates “Outstanding” performance and therefore is not the norm.</strong></p>\n<p>Asking for clarification of feedback is appropriate if students are unsure of the reasons for the allocation of a specific formative grade in the CPAF. However, any disputed assessment grades should be discussed with the relevant Personal academic tutor in the first instance and ultimately with the module co-ordinator.  Any dispute has to be based on fact and evidence, that either the assessment tool was not used appropriately or that the placement was managed in such a way that the student’s learning was hampered.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Each module should be viewed as an opportunity to build on the previous modules. Reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of previous placements should enable the student to learn from these experiences and plan how to address these limitations, or build on the strengths during the next placement. As placements progress students should be increasingly able to set themselves learning goals from each placement, and should discuss these at the beginning of each placement with the practice educator/s.</p>\n<p> </p>"

For student’s own comfort and safety, they are advised to wear comfortable soft-soled shoes. In most situations cardigans or sweatshirts are not worn in the patient contact environment.</p>\n<p>All students are required to wear a name badge, and in many clinical centres you may be asked to wear a hospital security pass. If students lose their name badge the address for replacements can be obtained from the Academic Administration.Please also ensure that all hospital passes (and locker keys) are returned to the site before leaving the site at the end of the placement – some sites may charge a deposit for these at the start of the placement, redeemable on return of key and/or pass.</p>\n<p>Most hospitals will have a strict policy regarding the wearing of jewellery. This again is for students’ own safety as well as that of the patient. This policy usually involves no rings other than a plain wedding band, <strong>no earrings other than small \"studs\", and no necklaces or bracelets. Watches must be removed when treating patients</strong> so avoid wearing a prized or expensive watch. <strong>Hair has to be worn off the collar.</strong> Hair falling over the face during practical work is not acceptable and would require appropriate action. As in many instances students will be working in close personal proximity to patients, personal hygiene is also an important consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>In Sept 2013 the Scottish Government Health Directorates produced guidance on the NHS Scotland Dress Code based on Evidence-based Principles to inform local policies for Staff. The key points are summarised below.</strong></p>\n<p>The way staff dress sends messages to the patients they care for, and to the public about their professionalism and standards of care. </p>\n<p>These guidelines reflect evidence-based good practice and aim to set out core principles that should inform the development of local policy.  The following principles are by no means exhaustive, but are intended to give some examples of the issues which NHS sites should consider. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staff should dress in a manner which is likely to inspire public confidence; for example: in clean uniform (where uniform is a requirement), with hair tied back off the collar, with nails kept short and clean.</li>\n<li>Wear clear identifiers, (e.g. badges etc.)</li>\n<li>Where changing facilities are available, staff should change into and out of uniform at work.  In any case, staff should avoid undertaking activities in public, such as shopping, whilst wearing their uniform, except where such activities form an integral part of their duties.</li>\n<li>Appropriate steps should be taken to minimise the risks of infections and cross contamination for patients and the public; for example: staff should wear short-sleeved shirts/blouses and avoid wearing white coats or neck ties when providing patient care;</li>\n<li>Staff should not wear false nails and nail jewellery or nail art is not permissible. Wrist watches can be worn but should be removed prior to any hands on patient care or moving and handling. (Rings must be small enough to allow the use of gloves with no risk of tearing gloves when providing patient care.</li>\n<li>All appropriate health and safety requirements for staff should be met for example: Staff should not wear excessive jewellery, such as necklaces, visible piercings and multiple earrings. </li>\n<li>Inappropriate tattoos must be covered at all times. What is inappropriate will be determined by the manager.</li>\n<li>Where a headscarf or veil is worn you must ensure that the flow of the garment not interfere with work practice.</li>\n<li>Staff should not carry pens or scissors in outside breast pockets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some NHS sites offer a laundering service for uniforms. However many sites feel it is appropriate, having conducted a risk assessment, that home laundering of staff uniform is acceptable.</p>\n<p><strong>Uniform Laundering </strong></p>\n<p>Some NHS sites offer a laundering service for uniforms. However many sites feel it is appropriate, having conducted a risk assessment, that home laundering of staff uniform is acceptable.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, uniforms should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Washed at the hottest temperature suitable for the fabric;</li>\n<li>Cleaned in washing machines/tumble driers which are well-maintained and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions;</li>\n<li>Washed separated from other clothes;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A clean uniform should be worn at the start of each shift.</p>\n<p> </p>"
