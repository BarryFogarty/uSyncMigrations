Contact <a href=\"mailto:%20lluhanga@qmu.ac.uk\">Contact Lisa Luhanga</a> for more information on single module study.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>The course delivers theoretical and practical learning opportunities with a strong emphasis on self-directed learning.</p>\n<p>Our teaching, learning and assessment strategy is framed by our core philosophical concepts of personhood, person-centredness, human valuing, healthful relations, human potential and development, and supportive and enabling environments. <br />You will be supported to challenge your thinking, values and beliefs, through the posing of complex activities and questions, and develop resilient and sustainable approaches to your learning and practice in response to these. Assessment strategies will encourage application to practice. This will be achieved through the use of varied strategies that draw on the student’s own areas of practice such as portfolio development, practice proposals, annotated bibliographies, simulation events, games, seminar presentations and self-determined contextual assignment topics. Tutor, peer and self-assessment, including within virtual environments (eg HUB@QMU), will be an important component of approaches to formative and summative assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement</strong></p>\n<p>The course is 50% practice-based and requires placement in an approved practice. To support learners in their practice learning environment they will be assigned to a Practice Supervisor and a Practice Assessor. Placement will be negotiated with your supporting NHS area.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>The course is an NMC validated course leading to the Specialist Community Public Health Nurse Qualification, and therefore the hours for theory and practice are stipulated by the NMC. It is a full time course over 52 weeks. Holidays are set by the University and spread throughout the year.</p>\n<p>In semester one for the first 6 weeks you will be full-time in University (either face-to-face teaching, online session or self-study). From week 7 you will be in practice placement for two days a week alongside university study days. Semester two will be full-time in practice placement along with university study days. Semester three is a 10-week period of practice consolidation where you will be full time for 50 consecutive days in practice placement.  </p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Class sizes will vary.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
