<p>All agenda items and papers may be disclosed under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 unless specifically exempted by the legislation. Where items cannot be disclosed, the relevant section of the Act is indicated.</p>
<p>*Due to restrictions in place during the Coronavirus Emergency, it is not possible for the University Court to meet ‘in person’. The Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator has recognised that holding meetings virtually is a good option, and states that charities may hold their meetings in this way, even where the governing document is silent on the matter. The University Court Standing Orders are silent on the matter. In line with good governance, the discussion and decisions of the University Court will be recorded in the form of confirmed minutes approved by members.</p>
<p>**The agenda is divided into starred and non-starred items. Starred items are for discussion and, where appropriate, decision. Non-starred items are for noting only and will not normally be discussed. Any member wishing to discuss a paper listed for noting should contact the Secretary no later than two days before the meeting stating the reason for the request.</p>

As advised to members previously, the <span>Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator had stated that charities may hold their meetings in this way, including where the governing document was silent on the matter. In line with good governance, Court discussion and decisions would be recorded in the usual form of confirmed minutes, approved by members. </span></p>\n<p><span>Apologies were RECEIVED from </span>Dr Andrew Scott<span>. </span></p>\n<p>Advising that this was the final meeting for two members of the University Court, the Chair extended sincere thanks and appreciation on behalf of the Court to Professor Graham Caie, CBE, Lay member, and to Ruth Magowan, Senate appointed member, for their outstanding contributions during six years of service.</p>\n<p>Throughout his tenure, Graham’s contributions to the Court had been informed by his extensive external engagement, his strong international perspective and in-depth understanding of research and quality assurance. As a member of the Equality and Diversity Committee, Graham had contributed to the<span> University’s widening access, student mental health and well-being agendas. Appointed to the role of Convener of the Audit and Risk Committee in 2017, Graham would chair his final meeting of that Committee on 24 November 2020. </span></p>\n<p>Ruth was due to stand down from Senate on 30 November 2020, having served the maximum six year period, which meant that her period of service on the Court ceased also. Court had benefited considerably from Ruth’s expertise and experience, including through her membership of the Nominations Committee, and more recently, her membership of the Principal appointment committee. Members were advised that an election to fill a number of vacancies on the Senate would be conducted shortly, and that Senate would conduct an election amongst all its members thereafter to appoint to the vacant Court role.</p>\n<p>In response to the Chair’s comments, Graham expressed his appreciation for the opportunity to contribute to the development of the University, including most recently, in relation to the 2021 REF submission. He thanked the Senior Leadership Team and wider University community for their hard work and support, and wished the University well for the future. Ruth thanked the Chair, the Secretary and wider Court membership for their support over her six year tenure, citing in particular the welcoming and supportive approach to the conduct of meetings, discussion and decisions.</p>"

There had been a healthy response to the SFC’s initial call for evidence on the coherence and sustainability of tertiary education and research during the coronavirus crisis, EU exit transition, and beyond. It was anticipated that an outcome of the first phase of the review would be available by the end of October 2020, although that was subject to confirmation. The review was expected to conclude by summer 2021.</p>"

      "title": "6 PRINCIPAL’S REPORT: CORONAVIRUS EMERGENCY",
      "content": "<p><span>The Principal presented members with a detailed update on the University’s business recovery during the period of the Coronavirus emergency, which included progress in student recruitment for 2020-21, commentary on the wider higher education context, and an assessment of the financial impact. </span></p>\n<p><span>Members were reminded that the immediate aim of the University’s business recovery planning was the delivery of a safe and successful academic year, with a rich learning environment, achieved through a flexible and creative approach. Longer term business recovery planning, i.e. beyond Academic Session 2020-21, was being undertaken in parallel, founded on the University’s strategic goals and values, and with a focus on financial </span>health as critical enabler for resilience and long term success. The Principal paid tribute to the continued excellent and constructive engagement with the Students’ Union and Trades Union colleagues throughout the business recovery planning process.</p>\n<p><span>Members were advised of the following key matters in particular: </span></p>\n<p><span>Blended learning</span></p>\n<p><span>Programmes continued to be delivered through a combination of online and face-to-face learning experiences. Requirements for physical distancing had resulted in the majority of learning experiences being delivered remotely. On campus teaching was possible for small groups, and had been incorporated for all levels, with particular emphasis on the first year student experience. The Principal highlighted the significant academic and social benefits of face-to-face interaction, and the University’s on-going commitment to the blended model, rather than full distance learning delivery. Despite the ongoing challenges, staff continued to respond flexibly and creatively to the circumstances. Students had similarly adapted well. Early student feedback in semester one demonstrated that students were appreciative of the efforts to incorporate face-to-face learning wherever possible. Blended learning would continue to be the default in semester two, building on good practice emerging in semester one, and with the benefit of additional planned investment in technology.</span></p>\n<p><span>Campus environment</span></p>\n<p><span>As reported previously to Court, strong safety measures were in place, including an enhanced cleaning regime, one way systems, and other adjustments to support physical distancing. Whilst numbers were significantly lower than usual on campus, the Principal was pleased to report a good atmosphere. All key services and facilities were operational on campus, albeit with necessary modifications. These included Student Services, the Learning Resource Centre and catering outlets. The Students’ Union was also open, making a vital contribution to student welfare and the wider student experience. </span></p>\n<p><span>Student occupancy levels in the residences were relatively high, at just over 90%. The University was working closely with the NHS Lothian Health Protection Team to respond appropriately to incidences of Covid-19. Thus far, cases had been comparatively low. Support for isolating students was being provided on a case by case basis, taking account of individual needs and with excellent support from the Res Life Team. On-going engagement with students was vital to help the University understand and be better placed to respond to their needs. Recent live discussion forums with the Senior Leadership Team had been very positive, confirming good student understanding of the restrictions and adaptations. </span></p>\n<p><span>Recruitment and retention</span></p>\n<p><span>Recruitment figures were largely positive, although some uncertainty remained around final numbers and fees mix at this stage in the matriculation cycle. Undergraduate entry levels were around 6% above the planned intake, with a small number of programmes having over-recruited following adjustment to Scottish Higher results. Taught postgraduate numbers would be confirmed in semester two, following the January start date for a number of programmes, including pre-registration healthcare programmes, which had been deferred from September 2020. Retention rates were also encouraging, with an indicative progression figure, at this stage, of 91%. In line with usual practice, withdrawals and deferrals would continue to be subject to close monitoring over the course of the year.</span></p>\n<p><span>Financial update</span></p>\n<p><span>The Principal provided headline information on the current financial position. The 2019-20 estimated outturn deficit remained unchanged from the June 2020 forecast of c£1.2m. The forecast deficit for 2020-21 was £2.3m, this being an improvement on the £3.8m June 2020 estimate. There remained considerable uncertainty over 2020-21, especially in relation to taught postgraduate fees and income from residences and commercial income, including summer language schools. Further detailed information provided under Minute 7 below.</span></p>\n<p><span>External context</span></p>\n<p><span>The Senior Leadership Team continued to engage extensively with the Scottish Government, and with other agencies and initiatives, both to support Scotland’s recovery from the coronavirus emergency, and to influence and respond to other national and sector priorities. The Principal extended his thanks to Senior Leadership Team colleagues in particular for their sustained and impactful external contribution, as well as sincerely thanking the many other colleagues working externally on behalf of the University. </span></p>\n<p><span>As reported previously to Court, the University had made individual and joint submissions to the Scottish Funding Council review of the coherence and sustainability of teaching provision and research activity. There was also extensive work ongoing across the University to develop new and existing partnerships internationally, nationally and locally. Such partnerships increasingly took the form of collaborative activity with universities and colleges.</span></p>\n<p>Detailed consideration of the impact of Brexit had not been included within the presentation, as it was difficult to make any concrete plans until such time as further detail became available from the Scottish and UK governments. However, members were reminded that Brexit was included within the University’s risk register, and advised that further updates would come to future meetings of the Court.</p>\n<p>Following the Principal’s presentation, the Student President and Student Vice-President provided an overview of work being progressed through the Students’ Union, together with an update on the student experience from their perspective. Both reiterated the importance of a strong partnership between the University and Students’ Union, noting that this provided a necessary channel for the student voice to be heard at all levels.</p>\n<p>Members were advised of positive feedback from students on the opportunities for face-to-face learning, and that the Students’ Union had also delivered a blended programme of welcome activities designed to help students develop networks, and to support good mental health and wellbeing. Societies had largely returned successfully, with good student engagement, although mostly online. Maintaining a sporting presence presented particular challenges, due to the evolving regulations and guidance. The University had funded a Compliance Officer role to assist in ensuring that a return to individual and team sports was managed safely. The Student Vice-President expressed his personal thanks to the University for this investment. The Students’ Union continued to work in partnership with other HEIs to share experiences and pool resources, where appropriate.</p>\n<p>The Chair thanked the Principal for his detailed presentation and extended her thanks to the Senior Leadership Team, the Students’ Union and the wider staff and student community for their exceptional on-going efforts.</p>"

These discussions had been protracted but were now moving towards a conclusion.

      "content": "<p><span>Court RECEIVED the Annual Report on the University’s Compliance with the Concordat on Researcher Development (COURT (20) 27). </span></p>\n<p><span>Speaking to the paper, the Deputy Principal advised members that the University had been one of the first universities in the UK and Europe to be awarded the HR Excellence in Research Award by the </span>European Commission in September 2010. The University had also <span>been one of the first UK universities to sign up to the Concordat in October 2019. </span>The 2019 Concordat provided impetus to drive the research agenda forward through systemic change, to share good practice and to ensure that the highest standards are applied consistently throughout the UK. Importantly, it sought to address the issues of most concern to researchers, such as the prevalence of fixed-term contracts and enforced mobility. The HR Excellence in Research Award badge had been developed to acknowledge institutions’ alignment with the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for their Recruitment.</p>\n<p>The Annual Report had been submitted in support of retention of the HR Excellence in Research Award and to support compliance with the 2019 Researcher Development Concordat. It was a requirement for all signatories to <span>the Concordat to produce an annual report to their governing body or equivalent authority, including strategic objectives, measures of success, implementation plan and progress report. The Deputy Principal highlighted the importance of the Concordat as a means of valuing the contribution of current staff, and of attracting new staff. Whilst there was a particular focus on contract researchers, the report also demonstrated the University’s commitment to the wider research community, covering a wide range of themes including integrity, wellbeing, networking and career planning. </span></p>\n<p>The Court welcomed the Annual Report and actions therein, noting the significant challenges facing contract researchers. In discussion, members noted some of the key actions, including mentoring, support in identifying funding, and facilitating access to wider external research networks, including the Scottish Graduate Schools for Arts and Humanities (SGSAH) and Social Sciences (SGSSS).</p>"

One low risk area for improvement had been noted in relation to identifying completion dates to monitor the progress of all actions within the annual update.

As part of the progress, a multi-level authentication process was being trialled, and would be rolled out to all staff this year.</li>\n<li>Risk management (minute 6 refers): The planned risk appetite workshop, which would be facilitated by Azets, had been rearranged as an online session. The risk management workshop would form part of a more extensive review of the University’s risk strategy. The Committee noted that a paper had been tabled on risk but requested that a full discussion paper be presented to the Committee firstly proposing the current risk appetite, thresholds and tolerances and any amendments or changes required in the short term and secondly proposing an approach to reviewing and implementing a fuller risk management policy and framework for approval in 2021.</li>\n</ul>"
