      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">What did you like best about studying at QMU? </span><br />In this course, almost all the classes have a group project which worked well for me because I like to participate in groups, and I like working with people. The teachers made sure to find a group that is the best fit for everyone. I made some good friends from working in the groups, and I think they have helped me to open my mind. For example, in the HR Management module, we discussed in class about how things operated in other countries. I think this really helped me see different views.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you feel like you could get extra support from the staff and teachers when you needed it?</span><br />Yes, I felt like I could get help for anything if I needed it. We even had a special department that helped us with a lot of things – like how to write an essay and do bibliographies. Some of the courses were difficult and I had to ask the teachers a lot of questions to get through it - why this, why that - and the teachers helped me a lot. Sometimes when I wasn't available to come into class, I could use the books in the online library, which was really helpful.</p>
<p><span class="lead">So you were studying very hard but did you have the opportunity to do other things too?</span><br />I was a part of the Student-Staff Consultative Committee where we got together with staff at the end of the year and talked about the course schedule and the modules and gave our feedback. I have a friend who is in the third year of the program now and we were talking recently about the essays in one of the modules, and I told him that in the first year I had two essays and he said he only had one essay for that course, which he said was helpful because he had more time to gather information and use feedback. I could see that the things we had suggested in the Staff-Student Consultative Committee had been put into practice.<br />Also, one of the best things for me was that I learned a lot of what I needed to know in the classes so I didn't have to go home and study, study, study all the time. I had more free time than my friends at other institutions to get practical experience. Including volunteering at TedEx and the Make a Wish foundation.</p>
<p><span class="lead">So what plans have you got for the future?</span></p>
<p>I am working here at the college in the accounting department. I think for right now I’m lucky to have a job doing what I studied and to have the opportunity to develop the skills I’ve learned. There are four people in the department where I work, so almost everything is a bit of a group or team task, and I’m glad to have the experience of working on group projects during my classes.<br />In the future, I’m thinking that I would like to open a sweet shop. I love sweets. I think this is my dream. I think that it is possible because now I have the knowledge, and I will be able to apply the knowledge that I have to achieve that dream.</p>
