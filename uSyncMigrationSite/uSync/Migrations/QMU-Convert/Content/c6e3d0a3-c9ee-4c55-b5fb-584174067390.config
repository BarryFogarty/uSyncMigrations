<p>A leading speech and language therapist in Mauritius, Nitishah works with children and adults who have speech, language and communication difficulties. She has led various projects in developing education and holistic rehabilitative services for Special Education Needs (SEN) schools.</p>
<p>“Studying at Queen Margaret University (QMU) in Edinburgh was an enriching experience not only professionally but also as a person,” she said. “By the end of my course, I was a self-confident woman who was eager to start working in my home country. The University provided me with opportunities to learn and grow as a student, as a professional and a person.”</p>
<p>Her passion for effecting positive social change is clear to see. “I believe that every little step one takes towards making positive changes can lead to a better world, and such changes can be more impactful when we all collaborate,” she said. “Collaboration is hard but not impossible. Once diversity can be respected and encouraged, there are possibilities to grow as individuals, as groups, companies or a whole country.”</p>
<p>Among her many achievements, Nitishah was responsible for supervising a project which provided an eight-year-old girl with a hearing impairment with high quality hearing aids. To date, Nitishah provides speech and language therapy for the child free of charge as the girl’s parents are unable to pay for such treatment in the long-term.</p>
<p>Dr Janet Beck, Head of Speech Sciences and Audiology at QMU, said: “We are so proud to hear that Nitishah has been recognised for the great work that she is doing in speech and language therapy.</p>
<p>"QMU is focused on producing graduates who have the ability and attitude to make a difference to the world around them. It is therefore heartening to learn that Nitishah is using her expertise to impact positively on the lives of both adults and children in Mauritius. She is a great ambassador for QMU and we wish her every success in the awards.”</p>
<p>Niamh Allen, Country Director at the British Council in Mauritius, said: “The remarkable individuals selected as finalists for the Study UK Alumni Awards in Mauritius have all taken their UK education as a starting point to excel in their chosen careers and shape the world around them.</p>
<p>“This year’s finalists are testimony not only to the diversity of UK alumni and their endeavours, but also to the transformative impact of a UK education.”</p>
<p>This year’s winners will be announced in an awards ceremony on 15 March 2019 at the State House with the acting President of Mauritius - H.E. Mr Paramasivum Pillay Vyapoory - as the chief guest of honour.</p>
