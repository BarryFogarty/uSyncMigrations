      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Each year, the University’s Careers team recruits a team of talented QMU students from different subject areas and year groups to help promote WOW events on campus and encourage fellow students to attend.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Previous WOW marketing officers have included students studying dietetics, business management and media.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">WOW events are designed to offer students from all areas of study the opportunity to learn from careers professionals and employers about all aspects of graduate and student employment.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">All students who apply for the WOW marketing officer roles will get the opportunity to develop their application and interview skills through a simulated graduate recruitment process. The successful candidates will also get the chance to develop their teamwork, creativity, organisation and communication skills.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Reporting to the Careers and Employability team, the student marketing officers are responsible for devising and carrying out a marketing campaign for the WOW events.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Last year the WOW student marketing officers achieved record student attendance at the WOW events.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Commenting on their experience as WOW Marketing Officers, last year’s team said:</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Elizabeth Jose (level 2, Dietetics):</strong> “Having attended the World of Work events the previous year, I knew how beneficial they were, so I decide to apply for a role to promote the initiative to other students. It also makes you feel like you are more involved in university life.</p>
<p>“I found it to be challenging at certain times, and fun at other times. I've met people who I would not have had the chance to meet otherwise and I'm so happy to have been able to get to know them better and work with such a great team. The experience has made me a more confident person.</p>
<p>“I would recommend other students to apply for this post, as it’s a great opportunity. Even the application process which involves a group discussion and interview is a good experience and practice for future jobs. You have the chance to gain new skills and not just in the area of marketing.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Charlotte Somerville (level 4, Business Management):</strong> “'I applied to be a WOW marketing officer as I wanted to gain first hand experience of conducting a marketing campaign. The role taught me many transferable skills such as time management, team work, organisation and responsibility as the campaign is your project and you decide how it is best done. I would highly recommend applying to be a WOW marketing officer as even if you are not successful, the recruitment stage gives invaluable experience into assessment centres, competency interviews and full feedback is provided.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Maria Grenman (level 3, Media):</strong> “I wanted to get involved in WOW because I think it’s such a great concept, and I think it’s fantastic that our University puts in the effort of organising these tailor-made sessions for student every year! Being part of the WOW team was a really fun and educating experience. I really loved working with my team, learned a lot coming up with new ideas and strategies for marketing WOW and making new friends in the process.</p>
<p>“I would recommend applying to be a WOW Marketing Officer because it’s a really good way to experience what it would be like to work for a company in a marketing position, but in a very safe and supportive environment.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Julija Lukaityte (level 3, PR, Marketing &amp; Events):</strong> “I applied for the role to gain some practical experience and to simply get more involved at university life. I believe that a lot of the students at QMU are not familiar with the benefits offered by the careers centre. This was a great opportunity to prove the fact that students can actually develop their professional skills outside the regular classrooms.</p>
<p>“I would definitely recommend it for students from School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management. They would be able to implement their knowledge in practice. This is a fun experience which also results in having a great job title in your CV!”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">There will be two information and guidance sessions for students interested in applying for the WOW Marketing Officer roles at 12.15pm on 24 th September in room 3170 at QMU and at QMU’s Annual Recruitment and Volunteering Fair in 1875 on at 1.15pm on 29 th September in room 0056. Sessions will include tips and advice on how to make a successful application.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">To apply for a paid WOW Marketing Officer position at QMU in Spring 2016, email Marion Pollock, Careers Adviser, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.qmu.ac.uk/campus-life/careers-and-employability/" target="_blank" title="Careers and Employability">Careers and Employability</a> at QMU, E: <a href="mailto:MPollock@qmu.ac.uk" class="txtMainTextLinks">MPollock@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The deadline for applications is Thursday 8th October 2015.</p>]]></Value>
