<p><strong>Bursary Code: BUR 22-09 </strong></p>
<p>Applications are invited for a research training bursary (i.e. A PhD plus Doctoral Certificate in Researcher Enhancement and Development). CASS Research Centre sits within the School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh. Applications are invited on any topic related to CASS’s current research, but our topic for 2022 bursary applications is:</p>
<p><strong>Ethnographic Film Practice, Community Participation and Ecological Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>This practice-based PhD project invites proposals from film practitioners keen to develop and situate their practice within a critically rigorous framework incorporating community participation and ecological sustainability. The project is interested in filmmaking practices designed with (and testing the limits of) community participation and may involve an immersion in local communities where sustainability issues are central, such as those threatened by climate change; or communities dependent on extractive industries such as oil and gas, or morally and environmentally dubious industries such as nuclear weapons, for local employment.</p>
<p>The candidate is likely to pursue an ethnographic approach, but similarly, might make use of focus groups, semi-structured, and unstructured interviews, to develop a screen project (for film or television) by embedding themselves within such a community to explore, substantially and with authenticity, the lived experiences of people in such places, and the tensions that exist between immediate local needs (employment, housing, etc) and global aspirations (climate breakdown, inequality, migration, nuclear weapons, and geopolitics).</p>
<p>Applicants should have a track record of excellence in the film and/or television industries. This project offers a choice of pathways for the development of creative practice. The final output will consist of either: a full-length original screenplay accompanied by a critical commentary; or a full-length film or equivalent short films, a sample screenplay excerpt and critical commentary; alternatively, you may produce a television pilot, accompanied by its screenplay and a critical commentary. The critical commentary will be between 30,000 and 40,000 words and should reflect on the methodological approach to practice research as well as the context of practice, i.e., the Scottish screen industries.</p>
<p>It is expected that the commentary will consider ethnographic film practice, screen representations of small communities, and issues of ecological sustainability, as well as Scotland and its landscapes, people, and places more generally speaking, as well as consider community participation in the arts generally, and in film specifically.</p>
<p>To apply for this project, please submit a 1000-word proposal that includes your suggested research question, a brief literature review, an outline of your proposed methodological approach to practice research, details of the project design, and a timescale for its completion.</p>
<p><strong>Research Centre:</strong> Centre for Communication, Cultural and Media Studies</p>
<p><strong>Supervisory team:</strong> Dr Robert Munro and Dr Eurig Scandrett</p>
<p>The successful applicant will be working within a highly skilled team of subject experts and will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>full waiver of tuition fees.</li>
<li>an annual stipend of £15,609 lasting 3 years for full-time study.</li>
<li>a research budget of £2000 to cover project expenses and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this bursary opportunity, CASS welcomes applications for co-supervision of students registered at other institutions or with external funding at any time. Self-funded and externally registered students would have more flexibility in the topic of their research and should contact relevant potential supervisors.</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is Friday 11 March 2022. <a href="/study-here/postgraduate-research-study/graduate-school-and-doctoral-research/phd-bursary-competition/" title="Bursary Competition">Visit our Bursary Competition web page for more information.</a></p>]]></Value>
