      "content": "<p>First-class researchers are much sought after in academia and by commercial and third sector organisations that want to gain an edge in their marketplace.  On this course, you will develop advanced research skills that are transferrable to almost any field. You will also learn how to apply your research techniques to real-world problems to make you more valuable to prospective employers.</p>\n<p>On the Research Methods module you will develop advanced research and analytical skills. The module on Communicating Research is important in a different way: here you will learn to think about how your research will be read, used and applied in the real world. Your approach will move beyond ‘how do I do this piece of research?’ to ‘what can this research do for people?’</p>\n<p>With this thorough grounding in research techniques and their relevance, you will move on to complete your own Research Project. You will comprehensively review the literature in your field, and then produce a final output, this could be either a research paper, a consultancy report or a briefing paper. Whatever forms it takes, your project is a major piece of work and is your chance to show the academic, scientific or commercial world exactly what you can do.</p>\n<p>The topic that you choose to research is up to you, as long as it’s in a subject that we teach. Past MRes students have researched topics as varied as eyewitness identification, molecular biology, the experience of living with type-2 diabetes, food bank use, and microbusinesses in Mexico. You will have the freedom to explore what fascinates you when developing a portfolio of research and analytical techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-nominal award titles</strong></p>\n<p>A post-nominal award titles means that the specific subject of your degree is named in its title. The award titles that we currently offer are:</p>\n<p><br />• MRes (Business Administration)<br />• MRes (Global Health and Development)<br />• MRes (Psychology) <br />• MRes (Person-centred Practice)<br />• MRes (Public Administration)<br />• MRes (Rehabilitation Sciences)<br />• MRes (Speech, Language and Hearing)<br />• MRes (Sociology)<br />• MRes (Public Sociology)<br />• MRes (Cultural Leadership)<br />• MRes (Cultural Practice)<br />• MRes (Clinical Science) <br />• MRes (Education)<br />• MRes **</p>\n<p>** The option of not specifying a subject remains open to all students</p>"

On completion of a single module, you may wish to complete further modules and progress your studies to a named award. <span><a href=\"mailto:%20rarthur@qmu.ac.uk\">Contact Rosie Arthur</a> or <a href=\"mailto:%20rdavis@qmu.ac.uk\">contact Rachael Davis</a> (Programme Leaders)</span> for more information on single module study.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>There are two compulsory taught modules designed to develop skills in, and awareness of, the modern research environment (Research Methods and Communicating Research). These are delivered via online learning.</p>\n<p>Students also take an elective module which you can choose to complement your research focus or develop particular skills. The majority of these electives are delivered online, however, those based in the UK and not requiring a student visa to study here, may be able to select an on-campus option for their elective module.</p>\n<p>A major component of this course is the Research Project, delivered in two self-directed modules, which offers you the opportunity to carry out an extensive piece of research. This carries the expectation of an output suitable for submission to the peer-review process for potential publication, or useful for the student’s future career in other ways.</p>\n<p>You will be assigned a supervisor with expertise in your area who will work closely with you on your Research Project.</p>\n<p>Please take some time to browse our full website and consider staff members in the relevant area who you may wish to approach to discuss supervision. We expect applicants to have identified a potential supervisor prior to application and contacted them.</p>\n<p>Depending on your research topic, our team will be able to facilitate engagement with industry/ stakeholder groups/professional bodies as necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Work-based learning</strong></p>\n<p>While there are no formal placements organised as part of the MRes, you can choose to carry your research out in a range of environments including business, industry, workplaces, services, community organisations and charities.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module will vary in terms of delivery, but each carries an expectation for you to manage your time and complete the necessary work. Most modules will involve weekly lectures and/or seminars delivered synchronously or asynchronously. Your attendance requirements at QMU will depend on the module you are studying and whether you are studying full-time or part-time.</p>\n<p>Each taught module will require 120 hours of directed learning, most of which can be done at a time convenient to the student.</p>\n<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>\n<p>Online only (with the exception of some elective modules for students based in the UK)</p>\n<p>Taught modules will be delivered using online learning.</p>\n<p>Online learning will be supported by video-conferencing based support and tutorials. Research projects will be primarily conducted externally however the use of an appropriate laboratory or an applied setting may be agreed between student and supervisor (UK based students only).</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>We expect around 10-15 students to enroll for this course each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>"

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">The Master of Research (MRes) is for those thinking about a career in academic or professional research. It is also suitable for individuals who would like to develop their research skills within their professional field as part of your continuing professional development (CPD). </span></p>
<p>An MRes can give you a competitive edge in the researcher job market and can also be a valuable stepping-stone towards a PhD. In this course you’ll gain advanced research skills, develop your own research project and earn an internationally recognised research qualification. You can study for the MRes full or part time. </p>
<p>While this course is delivered entirely online, some of the optional electives are available on-campus for those students based in the UK. International students will only be able to select from online electives as we are unable to sponsor students on a Student visa for this course.</p>
