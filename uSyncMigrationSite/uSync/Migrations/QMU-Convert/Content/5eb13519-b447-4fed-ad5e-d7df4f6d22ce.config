      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The Cross Trust operates as a charitable body and seeks to support young Scots, through financial awards offered to individuals and organisations. </p>
<p>Sir Alexander Cross founded the trust in his name in 1943 and sought to help young people who were of Scottish birth or heritage, to broaden their worldview and become fulfilled members of society. </p>
<p>His belief that, when young Scots are provided with opportunities to gain insights on human life, in all its forms, they are able to contribute to society in more meaningful ways. Today, this remains the founding principle of all activities The Cross Trust carries out. </p>]]></Value>
