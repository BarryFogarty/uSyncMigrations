</ul>
<p><span>After recognising the fundamental importance of quality assurance (QA) to our institution, we then found our discussion moving beyond QA to focus on ‘quality as enhancement’ and consideration of how we achieve this.  We talked extensively about this, but our key thoughts were distilled into the </span><strong><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">importance of a values-led approach that depends on ‘empowerment of’ and ‘trust in’ participants and partners, and which values collaboration, diversity of thought and fresh thinking</span></strong><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">. </span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">It may not be a surprise to colleagues from Queen Margaret University that these elements came to the fore, as we are proud to be a </span><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">values</span><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">-led institution that is founded on social justice:</span> </p>
<p><em><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">‘We value social justice. In fact it underpins our world view. We embrace equality, diversity, inclusion and respect and supporting our communities. Opportunities and access are open to all and on a fair basis</span></em><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">.’ (</span><a href="/about-the-university/our-strategic-plan/"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">QMU Strategic Plan 2020-25</span></a><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">) . </span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">We were, however, interested to note that several elements chime with definitions of quality enhancement in Vicki Stott’s recent ‘Defining Quality’ policy note (</span><a href="https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Defining-quality.pdf"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">HEPI Policy Note 33, 2022</span></a><span>): </span> <span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"></span></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="There is another view of quality – one that is transformational. This is enhancement, a view of quality that moves it away from being rooted in a product or in fitness for purpose, and sees it instead as a process of changes (or enhancements) for participants. It allows for the collaborative, co-creational nature of higher education, embracing the idea that both students and academics may be changed by the process. It includes notions of value-added, where educational experience enhances the knowledge, skills and abilities of students; it introduces the notion of empowerment; and it assumes participants engage in and influence their own transformation." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">The fact that the focus of our reflections rapidly moved to quality enhancement (QE) is undoubtedly influenced by the </span><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">Scottish HE sector’s adoption of an enhancement-led approach to quality* since 2003, facilitated by Scotland’s </span><a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/scotland/en/quality-enhancement-framework"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">Quality Enhancement Framework</span></a><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"> (QEF). The QEF has catalysed collaboration, empowerment, and trust between participants (students, staff and institutions) in Scotland for almost 20 years, and we agreed that this is very definitely something to celebrate.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">The Scottish Quality Enhancement Framework (QEF)</span></strong> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">Colleagues outside of the Scottish sector might be interested to know a little more about the QEF. It comprises </span><a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/scotland/quality-enhancement-framework"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">five key elements</span></a><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"> that, to date, have included Enhancement Themes (collaborative cross sector work), Enhancement-Led Institutional Review (ELIR) (peer review), Institution-Led Reviews, Student Engagement (in </span><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">all</span> <span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">elements of the framework), and providing Public Information. </span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">This enhancement-led approach embeds collaboration and partnership at its core, and over the past two decades all 19 HE institutions in Scotland have shared practice, engaged in peer review processes, and collaborated in sector wide projects to enhance the quality of the student experience at Scottish institutions and more widely across the HE sector. Throughout this time colleagues at </span><a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/scotland/en/home"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">QAA Scotland</span></a> <span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">have led the implementation of the QEF in </span><a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/scotland/about-us/who-we-work-with"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">partnership</span></a><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"> with the Scottish Government, sector agencies and all HE institutions in Scotland. This has not only provided a key route to assuring standards in Scottish HE, but has also expertly facilitated the connection and sharing of good practice on a regular basis at sector, institutional and individual level. </span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">More recently, the Scottish Funding Council’s (SFC) ongoing </span><a href="https://www.sfc.ac.uk/review/review.aspx"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">Review of Coherent Provision and Sustainability</span></a><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">) has catalysed enhanced integration across the tertiary sector in Scotland. Tertiary quality arrangements are currently under development and proposed for implementation from 2024-25, and the ELIR method has recently been superceded by a new external institutional review method which is being developed within the context of the SFC review. Phase 1 of this method, which contains two components Quality Enhancement and Standards Review (QESR) and Institutional Liaison Meetings (ILM) will run between 2022-24. The Phase 1 handbook will be published on QAA Scotland’s website early in the autumn.  </span> </p>
<p><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">This SFC review has also reinforced the crucial importance of student engagement in all aspects of quality, and we are fortunate to have </span><a href="https://www.sparqs.ac.uk/"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">sparqs</span></a><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">, a Scottish sector agency, to continue to champion and facilitate this across the sector. </span> </p>
<p><span>Having benefitted from being part of a powerful enhancement-led approach in Scotland, we have seen how impactful a collaborative, co-created approach can be for students, staff and institutions.  At QMU this has been embedded through a variety of initiatives led by our staff and students. Our Governance and Quality Enhancement team have been fundamental to the success of this, working in partnership with the whole University community. </span> </p>
<p><span>To conclude, the Scottish enhancement-led approach to quality is one that we’re very proud of. In QAA’s 25</span><span data-fontsize="11" data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun">th</span><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"> anniversary year it is a real pleasure to celebrate the fundamental role that </span><a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/scotland/en/home"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">QAA Scotland</span></a><span data-ccp-charstyle="normaltextrun"> have played in promoting and enhancing quality across the Scottish HE (and now tertiary) sector through collaboration, trust and empowerment. </span> </p>
