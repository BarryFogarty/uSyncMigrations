The examiners will take the extenuating circumstances into account in determining the performance of candidates.</p>\n<p>9.6.7  The period of disruption is from the time the alarm sounds until candidates are re-seated in the examination room. Should the period of disruption extend beyond one hour, then the examination will be considered null and void, and rescheduled at a time to be notified by the Registry Officer (Examinations).</p>\n<p>9.6.8  On re-admittance to the examination venue, the Senior Invigilator will instruct candidates as to whether or not the examination will be re-started, or has been declared null and void [in line with paragraphs 9.6.6 and 9.6.7 above].</p>\n<p>9.6.9  The Senior Invigilator will record the disruption on the Senior Invigilator Report so that the examiners can be advised to take this into account when assessing performance.</p>\n<p>9.6.10   During the period of evacuation the Regulations for Examinations should be considered to be suspended until the examination is re-started or ended.</p>\n<p><strong>9.7   Procedures in the event of network disruption</strong></p>\n<p>9.7.1  In the unlikely event of network disruption that affects an examination completed on a computer, the University will put in place alternative arrangements for the examination. The precise nature of these arrangements will be determined on a case by case basis. In all cases, the priority will be not to disadvantage students.</p>\n<p>9.7.2   In the event of network disruption, the examination will be handwritten, where possible and appropriate. Students with Individual Learning Plans who would normally use a computer to take an examination will be given the option of handwriting the examination. They will also be given extra time to complete the examination. Should this not be appropriate, attempts will be made to reschedule the examination.</p>\n<p>9.7.3   Should a network disruption coincide with an examination on the HUB, the examination will be rescheduled.</p>\n<p>9.7.4   Students are expected to check the University’s Facebook page and Twitter feeds for updates in the event of network disruption. Should there be a need to identify an alternative room for an examination affected by network disruption, physical signage at reception will provide details of the location.</p>\n<p><strong>9.8     Misconduct</strong></p>\n<p>9.8.1  If any candidate is suspected of cheating or other misconduct, the following procedure should be followed:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>The candidate’s examination answer book should be removed and endorsed by the invigilator as having been used prior to the incident.</li>\n<li>Any unauthorised materials should be removed and attached to the candidate’s original examinations answer book.</li>\n<li>The candidate should be issued with a fresh examination answer book and instructed to continue the examination.</li>\n<li>The Registry Officer (Examinations) should be notified of any incident immediately after the examination has finished.</li>\n<li>The Senior Invigilator’s Report should be clearly annotated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>9.9     End of the examination</strong></p>\n<p>9.9.1  The examination should be stopped punctually, and candidates should be advised either to remain in their seats until the answer books have been collected or to leave all relevant materials on their desks. Care should be taken to ensure that each candidate returns all relevant materials.</p>\n<p>9.9.2   The Senior Invigilator should count the number of answer books collected and complete and sign the Senior Invigilator’s Report.</p>\n<p>9.9.3   Answer books and all other materials should be returned to the Registry Officer (Examinations), unless the marker collects the answer books directly. Where the marker collects the answer books directly from the examination room the Senior Invigilator should ensure that the marker completes and signs the relevant section of the Senior Invigilator’s Report.</p>"

Full Assessment Regulations can be found at <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>11.6   Uploading Your Exam Paper</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Uploading your exam script</strong><strong> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The 24 hour dropbox period is to allow time for you to prepare and upload your script.
