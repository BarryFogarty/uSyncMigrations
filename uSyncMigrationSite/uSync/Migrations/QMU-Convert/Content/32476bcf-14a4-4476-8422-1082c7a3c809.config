<div class="column">
<p>Queen Margaret University can trace its origins to the foundation in 1875 of the Edinburgh School of Cookery, an institution that operated throughout mainland Britain, pioneering the training of teachers in nutrition, public health and domestic science. Under the previous title of Queen Margaret College, the University operated under the auspices of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) from 1975 to 1992, raising the majority of its programmes to Honours degree level and developing its research activities throughout that period.</p>

      "content": "<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In 1992, the former college was accredited by the CNAA, and shortly after that, it was granted taught degree awarding powers by the Privy Council. Research Degree awarding powers followed in 1998, with the Privy Council bestowing the title ‘Queen Margaret University College’ in January 1999. The University achieved full University titlein 2007, having satisfied the assessors that the University was exercising its degree awarding powers effectively and appropriately.</p>\n<p>The year 2007 marked a further important milestone in the University's evolution, with relocation to its current campus at Craighall. The first complete university campus to be built in Scotland in a generation, the campus was designed with a brief to place students at the centre of the learning environment. Other key design objectives included efficiency, flexibility and sustainability. In the period since 2007, the campus has won national recognition for its sustainable design and QMU has picked up a number of Green Apple and Green Gown awards.</p>\n<p>With a student headcount population of 10,200 for 2021/22, the University may be considered a relatively small institution in UK Higher Education terms. Of the headcount, 5,350 are based in Edinburgh with some 4,850 studying QMU degrees at collaborative partner institutions.</p>\n<p>The original plan for the campus allowed for potential growth in student numbers through a phased development of the site. However, with the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) cap on Scottish undergraduate numbers, there are no immediate plans for significant growth in on-campus numbers. Specific professional demands that underpin a significant proportion of our portfolio also actively restrict cohort size, and our capacity to expand student numbers across a number of subject areas. For example, annual intake to our healthcare programmes is constrained by placement availability, and by other related factors, including student number controls and workforce planning. The strategic focus of student number growth is therefore on an expansion of alternative models of delivery, including blended/online learning.</p>\n<p>As of December 2022, the University had 563 members of staff, made up of 309 academic staff and 254 professional services staff. The majority of the University’s staff are female (67.5%), which mirrors the University’s student demographic.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em>Table1: Academic and Professional Services Staff by Gender (as at June 2021)</em></p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 85px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 22.692308%; height: 34px;\">Staff Type</th>\n<th style=\"width: 18.974359%; height: 34px;\">Female -Total &amp; Percentage</th>\n<th style=\"width: 18.333333%; height: 34px;\">Male - Total &amp; Percentage </th>\n<th style=\"width: 20%; height: 34px;\">Total</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.692308%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\"><strong>Research &amp; Teaching</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.974359%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\">212 - 71%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.333333%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\">86 - 29%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\">299</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.692308%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\"><strong>Professional Services Staff</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.974359%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\">143 - 62%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.333333%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\">85 - 38%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%; text-align: center; height: 17px;\">231</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.692308%; height: 17px;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.974359%; height: 17px;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.333333%; height: 17px;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%; height: 17px; text-align: center;\">532</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University Strategy 2020-25, and the accompanying Delivery Plan, sets out how the University will respond to evolutionary change, building on its key strengths, adapting to overcome obstacles and creating new areas of strength.   In so doing, it draws on the University’s heritage, holding true to the principles and values on which the University was founded.  From its beginnings in 1875, Queen Margaret University has consistently addressed society’s needs and enabled positive social change.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our strategic plan continues to find expression in a number of discrete sub-strategies, including those of Student Experience and Research and Knowledge Exchange.  For each of these, we publish high level outcomes, or key performance indicators (KPIs), progress on which is reported quarterly to the University Court, University Senate and to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research continues to be central to our strategy. The vitality of our research culture promotes synergy between research, knowledge exchange, teaching and other activities, enhancing each individual element of our work.</p>\n<p>The REF 2021 results confirm the high quality of our research, its strong global reach, and the positive impact that its work is having in addressing many of the world’s most pressing social, economic and cultural issues. The University submitted research to REF 2021 under seven themes (REF 2021 Units of Assessment), and the expert peer review panels for REF 2021 confirmed that we had world-leading or internationally excellent research in every one of these themes. Our research was rated as world-leading in six out of the seven REF Units of Assessment to which we submitted work.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are committed to widening participation amongst students who have previously been inhibited from entering Higher Education for social, economic or cultural reasons but also to taking active steps to maximise their persistence and success. We have adopted a definition of ‘under-represented groups’ that has extended beyond that of the narrow Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) national indicator and have developed a range of initiatives to increase the participation and retention of those from a broad range of non-traditional groups.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our widening participation and retention strategy seeks to increase student numbers from non-traditional groups, including those that are first generation to go to Higher Education; from low progression schools; reside in communities in the lowest 20% and 40% of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (MD20); articulating students from Scotland’s Colleges, disabled students, or those who are Care Leavers. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have the 3rd highest graduate employment rate of any Scottish university, and 14th highest employability rate amongst all UK higher education institutions, with 97.1 % of those graduating from a full time undergraduate degree course at QMU going on to employment or further training within six months of graduating.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our partnership working with local authorities and with employers focuses on promoting employability and enterprise, and in securing the longer-term prosperity of our graduates and the wider community.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our partnership with East Lothian Council to develop an Innovation Park has at its core an ambition to contribute directly to the economic prosperity of the region, and beyond.  The University’s long-term land development strategy, which dates from 2002, includes the development of a commercial zone, and the protection of adjacent land for economic development purposes, including an Innovation Park. One of our Strategic Goals in our Strategic Plan 2020-2025 is to develop transformative research and innovation. Within this goal we say that we will:</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘Build on our existing strengths in new product development in food and drink, creative enterprise, social innovation and female entrepreneurship. Further embed enterprise and innovation across the academic portfolio and staff culture. Being cognisant of the disruption resulting from Covid-19, continue to be an anchor institution in the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, providing strategic leadership, connectivity and coherence in innovation strategically integrated into the regional growth agenda.’</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In supporting the University’s strategic vision described above, we have worked to develop the concept for the Innovation Park, such work contributing to the securing of Edinburgh and East of Scotland City Deal funding, of £30 million. The Innovation Park includes a planned expansion of our Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation (SCFDI), together with commercial space for growing SMEs. The intention is to deliver specialist and generic research and business support services, together with development facilities for target SMEs. The proposal aligns with a number of national policies, including Scotland Food and Drink’s strategic plan ‘Ambition 2030’, the Scottish Government’s Economic Strategy, and the UK Government’s updated Industrial Strategy.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1.2 Our Purpose</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see our purpose as helping to create a better society through education, research and innovation, and by providing a supportive and creative learning environment in which students and staff thrive.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In seeking to fulfil this purpose, we are clear and realistic about our strengths, focused on strategic goals, persistent in pursuing opportunities and overcoming barriers, and guided by our values.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our <a href=\"/about-the-university/our-strategic-plan/\" title=\"QMU Strategic Plan\">Strategic Plan</a> is enclosed as Appendix 1</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1.3 Our Values </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are a university that is modern in our outlook and facilities but with a maturity built on a long history of serving the community, both locally and globally, and enhancing its wellbeing. We work in a transparent and inclusive manner and hold to core values in everything we do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We value intellectual curiosity and the journey of discovery: We design our teaching and research to facilitate this.</li>\n<li>We value social justice. In fact, it underpins our world view. We embrace equality, diversity, inclusion, respect, and supporting our communities. Opportunities and access are open to all and on a fair basis.</li>\n<li>We value excellence. This is embedded in our research, teaching and learning, knowledge exchange and the services we provide. It will be exemplified in the experience of our students, staff and partners.</li>\n<li>We value ambition. We inspire our students and staff to achieve the best that they can. We pursue opportunities, often in partnership and collaboration with others, to transform and influence society for the better and enhance our visibility within the higher education sector and the wider economy.</li>\n<li>We value environmental sustainability. We recognise the severe threats to our environment and will be a sector leader in response. Our modern campus is a great asset in this work.</li>\n<li>We value the individual and encourage collective support. Each member of staff and each student has their own journey to make and their own contribution to give. Queen Margaret University provides the supportive environment to facilitate this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1.4 Strategic Goals</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To fulfil our purpose we have developed a set of strategic goals, with associated outputs, that are underpinned by our values.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide distinctive, accessible and high quality education</li>\n<li>Deliver transformative research and innovation</li>\n<li>Seek out partnership and collaboration</li>\n<li>Invest in the long-term future of the University</li>\n<li>Embed sustainability across our portfolio and practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These goals are explored in more detail throughout the Strategic Plan and the achievement of the associated outcomes is supported by a detailed delivery plan.</p>\n<p><strong>1.5 University Management Structure</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The powers and governance framework of Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh are prescribed in the Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh (Scotland) Order of Council 2007, the Queen Margaret University (Scotland) Order of Council 2015, and the amended Queen Margaret University (Scotland) Order of Council 2019.

The high-level relationship between the SFC and the University, including the mutual expectations of each party, are set out in the Financial Memorandum between the SFC and the University. A copy of the current Financial Memorandum between the SFC and the University is included at <strong>Appendix 6</strong> to this Handbook.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the financial memorandum, the University negotiates outcome agreements with the SFC to establish ‘the contribution that [the University] will make to the overall impact expected of the sector in return for public funding.’ How effectively these outcomes are delivered may affect future funding outcomes for the University. The outcome agreements cover a three year period, with annual monitoring reports. Outcome agreements are published on the <a href=\"http://www.sfc.ac.uk/funding/outcome-agreements/outcome-agreements.aspx\">SFC website</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guidance on the Scottish Government’s priorities for investment in colleges and universities can be found in the Letter of Guidance provided by the Cabinet Secretary for Further Education, Higher Education and Science to the Chair of the Scottish Funding Council.

In addition, all of Scotland’s HEIs have charitable status, placing on their governing bodies the legal responsibilities of trustees.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University is a registered charity and is subject to the provisions of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 (the Act). Under the Act ‘charity trustees’ means the persons having the general control and management of the administration of a charity.’ Also, any person who, though not formally elected or appointed as a charity trustee, exercises some degree of control over a charity, may nevertheless be held legally liable as a charity trustee. For the University, the members of the University Court are charity trustees.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charity trustees are responsible for the charity and may not pass this responsibility onto anyone else as long as they remain a charity trustee. It is also the responsibility of individual charity trustees to ensure that they personally are not disqualified from being a charity trustee. The following are disqualified from acting as charity trustees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>someone with an unspent conviction for dishonesty or an offence under the Act;</li>\n<li>an undischarged bankrupt;</li>\n<li>someone who has been removed under Scottish or English Law or the courts from being a charity trustee; and</li>\n<li>a person disqualified from being a company director.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The general duties of a member of Court as a charity trustee are that a member must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>act in the interests of the University;</li>\n<li>seek, in good faith, to ensure that the University operates in a manner that is consistent with its objects or purposes;</li>\n<li>act with the care and diligence that it is reasonable to expect of a person who is managing the affairs of another person;</li>\n<li>ensure that the University complies with the provisions of the Act and other relevant legislation</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond this, charity trustees also have specific duties relating to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charity details on the Scottish Charity Register;</li>\n<li>Reporting to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR);</li>\n<li>Financial records and reporting;</li>\n<li>Fundraising; and</li>\n<li>Providing information to the public.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further guidance on the roles and responsibilities of charity trustees can be found in the ‘Guidance for Charity Trustees’ published by OSCR at <strong>Appendix 10</strong> to this handbook.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of Court are unlikely to incur personal liability for acts carried out honestly, reasonably, in good faith and without negligence in fulfilment of their Court duties.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless the University maintains indemnity insurance to cover acts and omissions of Court members and senior officers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3.5 Appointment Process</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section seven of the Code (Appendix 13) provides that: <em>the governing body ‘must establish a nominations committee with a suitably inclusive membership to oversee the appointment of new members to the governing body.’  </em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clause 75, of section seven<em>, </em>provides that the nominations committee<em> ‘is expected to consider the field of candidates against a skills register which to and also to consider whether candidates share the values of the Institution and will add to the overall success and health of the Institution.

The Secretary will advise the Chair of the proposed agenda item. The Chair will decide whether the item is appropriate for discussion by the Court. The Secretary will inform the member of the Chair’s decision in relation to his or her agenda item. If the Chair agrees to the inclusion of the proposed agenda item, the Secretary will include that item on the agenda and circulate the revised agenda with the notice for that meeting.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Court may agree, by a two thirds majority of the members present at a meeting, to discuss any agenda items proposed by members, or any matter arising other than in relation to the agenda of the meeting or other than in accordance with notice requirements of the relevant Court Standing Orders.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>4.4.3 Amendments to Agenda Items</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amendments to an agenda item shall be considered as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where there is a single amendment, a vote on that amendment will take place;</li>\n<li>Where there is more than one amendment, a vote will take place on each amendment in the order in which the amendments have been put forward; those amendments which have been agreed (if any) will then be consolidated into a single amendment; and</li>\n<li>The agenda item (as amended) will then be voted upon.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>4.5 Decisions of the Court</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No member shall be entitled to have minuted his or her dissent from any decision of the Court, except at the meeting at which the relevant decision has been passed, provided that any member not present at the meeting at which the relevant decision was passed may at the next meeting have his or her dissent minuted.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, decisions of the Court shall bind all members of the Court, and no member may express dissent from any decision of the Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of that paragraph.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No agenda item, nor any amendment to an agenda item, shall be moved if it involves reconsideration of any question or matter which has been decided or adopted by the Court at any time within the preceding six months, unless it is moved by the Chair, or signed by the mover and by not less than one third of the total members of Court.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>4.6 Minutes </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Draft minutes of each meeting of the Court shall be sent to the members and to other persons who were in attendance at the meeting not later than 21 days after each such meeting, and shall be submitted at the next meeting of the Court for approval as an accurate record.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All members, and senior management who were in attendance at the meeting, shall be sent a complete set of draft minutes of the meeting.

      "title": "5. Effective Court Membership",
      "content": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This section of the Handbook is dedicated to providing a summary of different guidance material on the topic of effective Court membership. To assist Court members in finding out more about the relevant material, references to more complete information are contained within this section.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5.1 Involvement of Court Member in University Business </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advance HE, in its published guidance on being a governor of a UK HEI, indicates that the main type of involvement of Court members in University business include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The involvement of members of the Court in general institutional life.</li>\n<li>The involvement of individual Court members through committees and specific responsibilities.</li>\n<li>The involvement of the Court in providing advice and support to senior officers and the resulting relationship issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The involvement of Court members in the general institutional life of the University takes several forms including, but not limited to, formal induction provided to new Court members, Court members undertaking their own study/experiences of the University, engaging in University events where there is interaction with staff and students and possibly developing close links with particular area of the University.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Involvement by Court members also occurs through Court member participation on committees of Court and in discharging any specific responsibility provided to a Court member. The Advance HE guide provides the following list of reasons for this type of involvement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The size of the group means that there is more chance to participate.</li>\n<li>Discussion is likely to be more focussed on areas in which Court members can participate.</li>\n<li>Court members may have been selected for specific skills or attributes.</li>\n<li>Members hear of ideas earlier and feel they can make more of a contribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of the involvement of Court members with senior management, it is noted that typically the Senior Leadership Team attend and provide information and reports to the Court that inform its decision making processes. In this regard, it is important that the Court has confidence in the ability of senior management to provide the necessary information and support the Court requires to effectively undertake its functions.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond this formal role, there are also significant interpersonal relationships that can be built up between the Court and senior management whereby Court members act as ‘critical friends’ of the executive, providing ‘constructive challenge’ to the work of the executive improving the level assurance over management actions and also further enhancing the effectiveness of the Court.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all involvement in the institutional life of the University, Court members must be careful to maintain their independence and to not stray into the operational management of the University which is rightly the remit of the Senior Leadership Team. To do so would undermine the effectiveness of the Court in providing oversight and challenge functions to the operations and activities of the executive</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5.2 Developing Strategy and Measuring Performance </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5.2.1 Developing Strategy</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section one, clause three, of the Code provides that the governing body<em> “must be involved in the development of, take responsibility for, and monitor performance against the Institution’s strategic plan, which sets the aims and objectives of the Institution and identifies the financial, physical and staffing strategies necessary to achieve these objectives. It is also expected to approve an annual plan that identifies those aspects of the strategic plan being implemented in the year in question.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advance HE suggests in its guidance that ‘determining and approving strategy should not be a battle of wills between different “sides”, but a mature evidence-based process where those involved respect the role of others. Advance HE then set out some common challenges around how Boards consider strategy along with some techniques for managing these challenges.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common challenges include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A governing body lacking knowledge and credibility to assess a draft strategic plan in an informed way.</li>\n<li>An executive taking Court approval for granted or attempting to unduly influence the direction of Court decision-making.</li>\n<li>A lack of data on key aspects of the strategy, with the result that the Court has to take the strategy on trust.</li>\n<li>A lack of financial rigour in a draft strategy or an over-optimistic set of assumptions.</li>\n<li>A lack of time for Court members to consider a strategy fully given the complexity of some HEIs and the limitations of time for voluntary Court members.</li>\n<li>A lack of consistency in parts of the strategy.</li>\n<li>A lack of understanding of the external policy environment by either (or both) the executive or the Court.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategies for mitigating these challenges include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An expectation that it is the job of the executive to construct, propose and implement the strategic plan.</li>\n<li>Agreement about the initial criteria on which the strategy is based, using proposals from the executive and directly related to mission.</li>\n<li>An arrangement so that, ideally, the governing body has at least two opportunities to discuss the detail of the strategy (and any sub-strategies): an initial scoping discussion when the overall framework for a strategy is considered and a second opportunity to discuss the draft strategy based on the agreed framework.</li>\n<li>An understanding that the governing body is clear about what evidence it expects to see from the executive to support a proposed strategy, and thereby create the basis for performance indicators to measure the success of subsequent implementation.</li>\n<li>Agreement about how the strategy will be reviewed and the data required for this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.2.2 Measuring Institutional Performance </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clause 51, of section five, of the Code provides that</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>‘The governing body is expected to reflect annually on the performance of the Institution as a whole in relation to its strategic plan, with reference to agreed KPIs. Where possible, the governing body should benchmark institutional performance against equivalent metrics of other comparable institutions. The Institution’s annual performance against KPIs and its progress towards meeting its strategic objectives should be </em><em>published in its Annual Report.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advance HE highlights the following issues that may arise when it comes to measuring institutional performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Court should appreciate the difference between monitoring and measuring performance and be clear about what it is doing. Monitoring performance focuses on receiving periodic reports on performance and responding to these whereas measurement is more active in nature and involves setting targets, identifying key performance indicators for those targets and measuring performance against those indicators.</li>\n<li>The Court should determine where responsibility lies for generating targets and measures of performance. Ordinarily, senior management will identify appropriate targets and measures and the Court would agree to these. In so doing the Court should ensure that it is receiving the information it will need to satisfy itself as to the performance of the institution</li>\n<li>The Court should consider the appropriate scale and frequency of the measurement process. While annual measurement is common, ongoing measurement and ‘strategic questioning’ across the year should also be conducted.</li>\n<li>The Court should satisfy itself as to the robustness, timeliness and integrity of the information it receives to ensure that it is able to effectively carry out its responsibilities in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Advance HE, in terms of performance measurement information the Court should be receiving, as a minimum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annual returns made to the respective funding body.</li>\n<li>An annual report and associated documents for approval.</li>\n<li>Annual accounts and financial statements.</li>\n<li>Some kind of annual review of the implementation of the strategic plan.</li>\n<li>External quality reports such as those produced by the QAA and numerous other professional bodies.</li>\n<li>Specific information relevant to performance measurement by sub-committees, for example data to assess the achievement of HR strategy and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, to these materials, typically the Court will also receive internal key performance indicators flowing form the University’s strategic plan in addition to a range of other performance indicators from sub-strategies relating to various aspects of the University’s operations.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Advance HE, other approaches typically used by University governing bodies to review institutional performance include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Benchmarking performance against comparable HEIs.</li>\n<li>Adapt approaches to effective performance measurement from other sectors such as the balance scorecard approach.</li>\n<li>Better integrating approaches to risk management and performance management.</li>\n<li>Conducting formal mid-term strategic reviews to enable flexibility in ensuring that the University remains competitive in a changing environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University also publishes details of its financial performance and performance against strategic goals in its Annual Report and on its website.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5.3 Assessing Court Effectiveness</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clause 49, of section five, of the Code provides that</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>‘The governing body is expected to review its own effectiveness each year and to undertake an externally facilitated evaluation of its own effectiveness and that of its committees, including size and composition of membership, at least every five years. As part of these processes or separately, the effectiveness of the academic board (also known as Senate, Senatus Academicus or academic council) is expected to be reviewed similarly. These reviews should be reported upon appropriately within the Institution and outside. Externally facilitated reviews should be held following any period of exceptional change or upheaval (allowing suitable time to see the effects of changes made), the usual timetable for externally facilitated review being brought forward if necessary in these circumstances.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Court engages in an annual review of its effectiveness, and engages in an externally facilitated review of its effectiveness no less than every five years, including an assessment of the Court’s adherence to the Code. Alignment with the Code and a judgement of effective are also published KPIs for the University.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5.4 Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk is defined as the possibility that an action, event or set of circumstances will adversely or beneficially affect an organisations ability to achieve its objectives. Risk management is defined as the planned and systematic approach to the identification, evaluation and control of risk.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following key principles outline the University’s approach to risk management and internal control:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The University Court has responsibility for overseeing risk management within the institution as a whole.An open and receptive approach to solving risk problems is adopted by the University Court.</li>\n<li>The Principal and the senior executive support, advise and implement policies in line with the risk management framework approved by the University Court.</li>\n<li>The University makes conservative and prudent recognition and disclosure of the financial and non-financial implications of risks</li>\n<li>All managers are responsible for encouraging good risk management practice within their respective areas.</li>\n<li>Risk management is be embedded throughout the University. The responsibility for risk management is shared by all staff.</li>\n<li>Key risks will be identified and closely monitored on a regular basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University Court has a fundamental role to play in the management of risk.  Its role is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the tone and influence the culture of risk management within the institution.

bodies in higher education</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>6.2.1 Scottish Funding Council </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council was established in 1992 under the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act to provide financial support for teaching, research and associated activities in Scottish higher education institutions. Through the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 2005, this was replaced by a new body, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council (SFC), which provides funding and support for Scotland's colleges and universities. The Council is a non-departmental public body responsible to the Scottish Government through the Advanced Learning and Science Directorate. Its main functions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To distribute funds to support teaching and research in higher education institutions.</li>\n<li>To secure that provision is made for assessing the quality of higher education supported by the Council.</li>\n<li>To provide Scottish Ministers with information and advice relating to all aspects of higher education in Scotland, including the financial needs of the sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6.2.2 Universities Scotland </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Universities Scotland is the autonomous voice of the higher education sector in Scotland. It works for the Principals or Directors of Scotland's higher education institutions.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a membership organisation, funded by Scottish universities and colleges of higher education to support and promote their work, to argue for the public support needed to maintain and build on their achievements, and to develop policy on Scottish higher education issues.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Membership includes all Scottish universities and higher education institutions funded by the Scottish Funding Council. This body is the principal formal channel of communication between the Funding Council and the universities in Scotland which it funds.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6.2.3 Universities UK </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Universities UK is the representative body for the executive heads of UK universities. Its task is to support the work of universities and promote their interests, in particular to increase understanding of the value of their work throughout the UK and campaign for adequate funding to meet their needs. It works by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formulating common views on matters which affect UK universities collectively.</li>\n<li>Representing the universities in dealings with UK institutions and other organisations and individuals worldwide.</li>\n<li>Providing information and central services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6.2.4 Committee of Scottish Chairs (Higher Education Institutions)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a representative grouping of the senior lay member of each of the universities in Scotland.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6.2.5 Committee of University Chairs</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a grouping of the Chairs / Senior Governors of the Governing Bodies of United Kingdom universities.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </p>"
