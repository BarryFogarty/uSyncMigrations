<p class="txtMainBlack">The award-winning students were joined by the companies and individuals whose generous support has helped boost their academic experience, personal development and made special student projects possible.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Petra Wend, Principal &amp; Vice-Chancellor of Queen Margaret University, said: “The University is grateful for the continued support of organisations, individuals and QMU graduates, which greatly enhances the experience of those students who receive scholarships and awards.</p>
<p>“Awards and scholarships like this enrich students’ academic experience, build their confidence, broaden their horizons and allow them make a real contribution to their field or to serving society’s needs.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Santander Universities </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Santander Universities supports QMU through a variety of scholarships and awards. These include generous scholarships for new and existing students, awards for overseas research or project work, and grants for community projects involving students.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Alzheimer Scotland Scholarships </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Alzheimer Scotland Scholarships are providing part funding for QMU students to undertake a stand-alone MSc module focused on ‘Developing Rights-Based Practice for Allied Health Professionals working with People Living with Dementia, their Families &amp; Carers’ at QMU.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Dakota Hotels </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Dakota Hotels is offering annual internships and financial sponsorship to students on QMU’s hospitality and tourism degree programme. QMU's hospitality division has been working with Dakota Hotels for several years. Dakota Hotels has also provided undergraduate internships to several hospitality and tourism students and, more recently, has welcomed two QMU graduates onto its Graduate Development Programme.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>The Vice-Chancellor’s Award </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Petra Wend, QMU Principal, created the Vice Chancellor’s Award for the specific purpose of broadening students’ horizons, providing the means for students to travel abroad to study or take part in exchanges.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>The Princess Alice Award </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, Scholarship, is an annual award which aims to fund, either wholly or in part (to a maximum of £1000), overseas research-related initiatives which are likely to advance knowledge and/or have a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>The Student Development Fund </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The Student Development Fund is an opportunities fund supported by donations from QMU graduates, friends and supporters. It is designed to help students fund worthwhile projects that couldn't happen otherwise. The Student Development Fund can also help students make the most of their time at QMU and all students are eligible to apply. The awards are open to individuals, clubs and societies or other groups made up of QMU students.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Ryder Cup bursary scheme </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Ryder Cup Europe has made a commitment to QMU to fund five tourism, hospitality and event student bursaries per year for a total of four years. The bursary scheme means that a total of twenty QMU students will benefit by receiving £1000 each. The bursaries will help the students pay for their travel and accommodation costs and ensure they can access courses relevant to The 2014 Ryder Cup.</p>]]></Value>
