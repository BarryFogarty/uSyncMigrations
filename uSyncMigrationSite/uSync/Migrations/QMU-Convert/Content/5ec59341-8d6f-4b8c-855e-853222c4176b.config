<p>Dissertation title: <strong>Creative use of the Tree of Life narrative methodology to develop the emotional resilience of refugee children, young people and their parents in the UK</strong></p>
<p>My PhD is based on previously published papers about my practice as a clinical psychologist offering mental health interventions for refugee children and families within a specialist NHS service in London. I carried out practice based research into the narrative approach which I developed, using creative adaptations of the ‘Tree of Life’ collective methodology. I chart the development of this practice over time in 4 papers, drawing on qualitative research methodologies (critical grounded theory) and mixed-methods designs. I examine the impact of adapted ‘Tree of Life’ interventions with mothers and refugee children in a number of schools, and a ‘Team of Life’ project for refugee youth collaborating with Arsenal football club. Outcomes form this work are brought together in a final paper of practice guidelines for supporting the emotional resilience of refugee young people.</p>

<p>Dissertation title: <strong>Navigating Challenges and Advancing Strategies for Non-Communicable Disease Policy Adoption and Implementation</strong></p>
<p>This PhD study aims to address challenges in adopting and implementing non-communicable disease (NCD) policies and interventions. It examines the political economy factors and the complex dynamics involved, offering a global, regional, and country perspective, with focus on fragile and conflict-affected settings. The study reviews barriers and enablers to NCD policies globally and conducts empirical studies on policy processes for NCD adoption and interventions in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (special focus on diabetes) and in Sierra Leone. It recommends areas for global, regional and local action, including robust accountability, transparent engagement with the private sector, context-specific data collection, and managing commercial determinants of health. Emphasizing system thinking, the research enhances understanding and implementation of complex public health interventions. The study's insights can guide policymakers, healthcare professionals, and organizations toward more effective NCD policy strategies.</p>

<p>Dissertation title: <strong>Strengthening Community Health Worker Programmes in Urban Fragile and Conflict-Affected Contexts</strong></p>
<p>This thesis investigates the resilience of Community Health Workers (CHWs) and their programmes in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Settings (FCAS). It seeks to understand how these essential healthcare providers and their initiatives navigate the inherent shocks, uncertainty, and fragility in conflict regions. The study combines insights from key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and work-life histories to glean a nuanced understanding of coping mechanisms and adaptive strategies. The data undergoes a robust analysis, using thematic, descriptive, ranking, cluster, narrative, and contextual techniques. The findings unveil the intricate experiences of CHWs within the FCAS context and propose pathways to enhance resilience among CHWs and their programmes. These insights can contribute significantly to optimising healthcare delivery in conflict-stricken regions.</p>

<p>Dissertation title: <strong>The role of Information and Communication Technology – ICT in supporting the delivery of health services in conflict-affected areas during the Syrian conflict</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of the research is to investigate how ICT can support the continuity of health services in disaster and war-affected settings. The research endeavours to comprehensively survey the academic literature pertaining to ICT usage in healthcare provisioning across remote contexts worldwide. Additionally, the study will explore the specific ICT applications employed by health-focused Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in response to the Syrian conflict. Methodologically, the research adopts a pragmatist worldview, while Grounded Theory is chosen as the most suitable and pertinent qualitative approach. The study aims to yield a comprehensive understanding of ICT applications in healthcare provisioning amid the unstable and volatile context of conflict and disasters.</p>

<p>Dissertation title: <strong>National Medics as Survivor-Helpers on the Frontline of Armed Conflict: Remote Management in Coordination Communication and Decision Making</strong></p>
<p>National medics working on the frontline of armed conflict face difficult and often dangerous challenges. Shortage of drugs, supplies and medical equipment is a constant denominator in most armed conflictsy target medical facilities and health care workers with impunity. Additionally, national medics must cope with the potential and real loss of family members, colleagues and friends in the conflict environment they all share. In fact, national medics have a much greater risk of injury and death during armed conflict than their international counterparts. International non-governmental organisations who employ national medics, have historically worked alongside them in the field. However, many international organisations have adopted remote management and coordination of their national staff in the field as a strategy to protect international staff. The purpose of this research is to understand the meaning and impact of these challenges on the work, relationships and morale of national medics on the frontline. These research objectives are explored through qualitative methods using a grounded theory approach.</p>

<p>Dissertation title: <strong>Using a Realist Research Approach to Explore the Influences of Community-Based Interventions on the Behavioural Risks for Noncommunicable Diseases</strong></p>
<p>This is a realist-informed study that seeks to understand the role of community-based (CBI) interventions in modifying the shared risk behaviours for cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes in adults. The primary objectives are: (1) To develop a realist program theory that explains the mechanism and associated context by which community-based interventions modify tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol, and (2) To refine the program theory through realist qualitative interviewing of state-level CBI implementers and community members in Lagos Nigeria.</p>

<p>Dissertation title: <strong>The implementation of the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health policy in Sierra Leone: Dynamics, challenges, and opportunities faced by policy implementers at the national and sub-national levels.</strong></p>
<p>This research aims to understand the challenges in the implementation of the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (RMHCAH) Policy in Sierra Leone. It employs an ethnographic research methodology to understand the interactions, dynamics, challenges, and opportunities in RMNCAH policy implementation spaces at the national and sub-national levels. It combines participant observations, in-depth interviews, power mapping and document review to deepen the understanding of the everyday negotiations and contestations that underpin translation of policy objectives into practice in resource-poor countries like Sierra Leone. Given the accelerated efforts by the government of Sierra Leone to attain Universal Health coverage targets, findings from this research will provide a detailed account on how to improve the implementation of health policies in the global south.</p>

<p>Dissertation title: <strong>Examining the Effectiveness of Social Mixing Activities in Creating Better Social Cohesion Between Migrants and Non-Migrants in West Lothian, Scotland.</strong></p>
<p>My research aims to examine how social activities can enhance social cohesion between migrants and non-migrants in West Lothian, Scotland. While I may not have the ability to change the world, I firmly believe that I can make a difference in the lives of those around me. I believe academic researchers and policymakers should pay more attention to the experiences of individuals residing outside major cities such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Fife, and Dundee. With the assistance of Police Scotland, Edinburgh &amp; Lothian Regional Equality Council (ELREC), and West Lothian Council, I will employ mixed methods to answer my research questions. The expected outcomes of this research will broaden the concept of integration beyond just refugees and apply it to all members of society. Additionally, the research will provide practical solutions to local authorities and policymakers that can help foster social cohesion, reduce racial discrimination, and alleviate structural inequalities.</p>
