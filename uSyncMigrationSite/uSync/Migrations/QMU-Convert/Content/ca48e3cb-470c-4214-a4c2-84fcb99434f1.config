<p>The University Procurement Strategy, which is aligned with the corporate aims and objectives, established collaborative initiatives and necessary regulatory compliance, was endorsed by the Executive Board and published in July 2022. The approved strategy is the culmination of consultation and engagement with different stakeholder groups affected by the institutional approach to procurement.</p>
<p>A successful shared strategic focus is built upon an alignment of perceptions and understanding around what University needs from a well performing procurement process that is consistent with the strategic aims and objectives of the University. That focus also needs to take proper cognisance of the environments within which University operates to ensure that external drivers and influences for improvement are addressed appropriately.</p>
<p><span class="lead">2. Procurement Strategy</span></p>
<p>The Procurement Strategy, used in conjunction with the institutional Procurement Policy, sets out the strategic institutional approach to procurement within the prevailing regulatory environment. The Action Plan element of the Strategy translates the strategic objectives and desired outcomes into the detailed actions and processes required to maintain a cost-effective (and legally compliant) institutional procurement operation. Its focus is all staff involved in buying goods and services on behalf of the University, including management staff responsible for authorising and monitoring transactions.</p>
<p><span class="lead">3. Procurement Mission </span></p>
<p>The University is committed to obtaining value for money in all of its transactions, and in conducting its daily business staff must always consider the University’s wider responsibilities in terms of legal, moral, social, economic and environmental impact. Effective procurement will support the key institutional objectives across these important operational dimensions. <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/97672263ea164cf694e054a0c2983031}" title="Our Strategic Plan">QMU Strategic Plan 2020</a></p>
<p><span class="lead">4. Strategic Procurement Objectives</span></p>
<p>The broad procurement objectives are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To sustain and further develop partnerships within the sector, with other publicly funded bodies, with professional bodies and appropriately with supply markets that will yield intelligence, innovation and deliver value to users of procurement services. <strong>[Strategic Goal – Seek out partnership and collaboration]</strong></li>
<li>To work with internal academic budget holders, professional support service colleagues and suppliers to deliver innovation and best value to the learning, research and service support communities through the development of an effective and co-ordinated purchasing effort within the University. <strong>[Strategic Goals – Provide distinctive, accessible, high quality education and Deliver transformative research and innovation]</strong></li>
<li>To promote the delivery of value for money through good procurement practice and optimal use of procurement collaboration opportunities. <strong>[Strategic Goal – Invest in the long term future of the University]</strong></li>
<li>To seek out professional development opportunities to enrich and enhance experience and capability of procurement practitioners and to work with the supply chains to ensure continued value, managed performance and minimal risk throughout the life of contracts for the benefit of customers and students.</li>
<li>To develop sound and useful procurement management information in order to measure and improve procurement and supplier performance in support of corporate planning conducted through fair and transparent process. <strong>[This enables the University to ensure that the objectives set out are being met, and thus supports each of the strategic goals noted]</strong></li>
<li>To embed sound ethical, social and environmental policies within the University’s procurement function. This will seek to respond to the global climate emergency, promote Fair Work First and comply with relevant Scottish and UK legislation in performance of the sustainable procurement duty. <strong>[Strategic Goal - Embed sustainability across our portfolio and practices]</strong></li>

<td style="width: 256px; height: 10px; text-align: left;">In setting out its policy, a contracting authority should ensure that it takes into account relevant legislation, statutory guidance and any other relevant guidance or best practice. The statement should, despite being general, outline what the policy is; when it is applicable; the aims and objectives of the contracting authority in its use of community benefits requirements; and how the authority will implement and monitor its policy</td>
<td style="width: 250px; height: 10px; text-align: left;">For every procurement over £4m, the University will consider how it can improve the economic social or environmental wellbeing of its area through inclusion of community benefit clauses, to assist with its strategic objective seeking out partnership and collaboration and embedding sustainability across our portfolio and practices. Such improvements could be implemented through mandated delivery of training opportunities or subcontracting opportunities within the University's area. Where possible and proportionate, such clauses may be included in procurements below £4m. Monitoring of outputs of such measures may be assessed through contract management or standardised benefits reporting.</td>

<td style="width: 250px; height: 18px; text-align: center;">For each procurement, the University will consider the community affected by the resultant contract and ensure any affected organisations/persons are consulted (e.g. impact on service for students, or a local contract that could be combined with other similar University’s needs). Such consultation will always be on a scale and approach relevant to the procurement in question.</td>

<td style="width: 280px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">Statement of the authority’s general policy on the payment of a living wage to persons involved in producing, providing or constructing the subject matter of regulated procurements.</td>
<td style="width: 256px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">In setting out its general policy, a contracting authority should state measures to promote the payment of the Living Wage in its procurements. In doing so, a contracting authority should consider:<br />• becoming a Living Wage Accredited Employer and promoting this through relevant public contracts;<br />• in what types of goods, services and works contracts it may be relevant to address living wage and fair work practices;<br />• how its living wage policy will be approached in regulated procurements in a way which takes account of other relevant factors, while ensuring an appropriate balance between quality and cost;<br />• how it will ensure a proportionate approach, based on the nature, scope, size and place of the performance of the contract; and<br />how it can contribute towards improving the social wellbeing element, in particular reducing inequality in its area, of its sustainable procurement duty under section 9 of the Act by promoting the Living Wage and fair work practices.</td>
<td style="width: 250px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">
<p>The recognises the values of a well-motivated and dedicated workforce both in its own organisation and in those of its suppliers. As an accredited Living Wage employer, the University will consider the fair work practices of suppliers in its procurements, including application of the Living Wage.<br />The University has developed internal procedures so that Fair Work First is incorporated in all relevant procurement processes from strategy through to evaluation of tenders and monitoring of outcomes.</p>

<td style="width: 256px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">In setting out its statement, a contracting authority should consider how it will assess the potential health and safety risks arising from a particular contract and how it will monitor contracts to ensure compliance with health and safety requirements, including how an economic operator demonstrates compliance.</td>
<td style="width: 250px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">The University is committed to contracting only with suppliers that comply with all appropriate and relevant legislation, including Health and Safety legislation.

<td style="width: 250px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">The University supports the sourcing of goods that are fairly and ethically traded. Where relevant it shall make use of appropriate standards and labels in its procurements to take account of fair and ethical trading considerations, will consider equivalent offerings from suppliers in its tenders and consider the use of lifecycle costing.

<td style="width: 256px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">In setting out how they intend to ensure that their regulated procurements will contribute to the carrying out of its functions and achievement of its purposes, a contracting authorities should, for example, consider:<br />• effective and relevant consultation when developing and aligning their organisational procurement strategies with its functions, purposes and the National Outcomes;<br />• effective contract and supplier management to monitor the effectiveness of regulated procurements;<br />• high level commercial targets;<br />• community and stakeholder consultation during procurement exercises; and<br />use of clear outcomes in contract notices.</td>
<td style="width: 250px; height: 18px; text-align: left;">
<p>The University will analyse third party expenditure, identify ‘GPA/OJEU regulated procurements’ and ‘lower value regulated procurements’ [goods and services worth more than £50,000, works worth more than £2 million].</p>
<p>The University will sort regulated procurements into procurement categories. How these goods, services and works are bought - joint purchasing, use of local, regional and national framework agreements, consolidated contracting – will be subject to annual review with APUC and through user consultation, optimal category strategies agreed, sensible aggregation opportunities exploited, category and commodity strategies developed, recorded and the most appropriate procurement routes to market chosen.<br /><br />The University will conduct all regulated procurements in compliance with principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination, transparency, proportionality and mutual recognition.<br /><br />The University shall utilise portals including PCS and PCS-T to publish its procurement opportunities and shall strive to ensure appropriate use of lotting, output based specifications and clear evaluation criteria to ensure the procurement is accessible to as many bidders as possible.</p>
<p>The University will ensure that it awards regulated procurements only to businesses [and sub-contractors] that are capable, reliable and, where relevant, that can demonstrate that they meet high ethical standards and values in the conduct of their business.</p>
<p>In making regulated procurement contract awards, quality, risk and sustainability factors will be considered along with cost according to declared score weightings on a contract-by-contract basis.</p>
<p>The University will make appropriate use of collaborative contracting arrangements (e.g. national, sectoral or local framework agreements or contracts) to deliver improved contract terms, contract and supplier management, sustainable procurement outcomes and value for money.</p>
<p>The University will take steps to make it easier for smaller businesses to bid for contracts. Legislative constraints preclude preferences for only local suppliers but the local dimension can be addressed through the structure of tenders, the use of Public Contracts Scotland and Quick Quotes, training and information to build capacity and publishing a contracts register to highlight contracts for which local organisations may be interested in bidding.</p>
