<p>QMU’s Athena SWAN and Concordat Steering Group (ASCSG), chaired by the Deputy Principal, has monitored progress against the published 2018-20 Action Plan. Our Principal publicly declared QMU’s commitment to the new Researcher Development Concordat in October 2019, our enthusiasm and support reflected in our position as one of the first 10 UK institutions to sign up. The ASCSG appointed a subgroup - The Researcher Development Concordat Working Group (RDCWG), led by a nomination from the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) to oversee the implementation of the 2018-20 Action Plan and its transposition into the new 2019 Concordat template. The ASCSG reports to the SLT (Chaired by the Principal), Research Strategy Committee (RSC) , Equality and Diversity Committee and relevant School / Research Centre boards, ensuring explicit articulation with wider institutional strategies. Membership of the RDCWG includes: Head of Research and KE Development Unit (RKEDU); Head of HR; 2 Senior Professorial level staff (Head of Graduate School and University Academic Lead for REF 2021); University Contract Research (CRS) Staff Mentor; Research Grants and Contracts Advisor; 4 representatives from CRS; Trade Union representative; 3 Post Graduate Researchers (PGRs). QMU was one of only 22 UK HEIs to run the UK CEDARS Survey in July 2020. Given the timings of the Cohort 1 HRiR submission and the close of CEDARS at 31 July 2020 we have not been able to undertake detailed analysis of feedback to inform SMART targets to underpin the 2020-22 Action Plan, however after full consultation with research staff we will develop an effective, visible action-based response to CEDARS feedback incorporating SMART measures for CEDARS items identified in the Action Plan. We are committed to running CEDARS again in July 2021 to monitor progress against July 2020 baseline data with the aim of increasing staff participation in CEDARS 2021 from 31% in 2020 to 40%.</p>
<p><strong>Gap Analysis and Transposition Process</strong></p>
<p>QMU has been a strong advocate of the 2019 Concordat, the spirit and principles of which firmly resonate with our Strategic Plan, SFC Outcome Agreement and REF Strategy. We welcomed its publication and the transposition of our action plan against the new principles was a natural and timely progression in terms of where we were as a small but progressive post-92 institution. In November 2019 the RDCWG undertook a gap analysis, led by CRS. Committed to co-creation and co-ownership, the RDCWG worked collaboratively to identify new/updated actions with each action having a named professional services/researcher lead, split predominantly across the three Concordat principles. Within QMU the Concordat applies to all research staff.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation informed by:</strong></p>
<p>• Development of Strategic Plan 2020-25 and 2019 University Outcome Agreement to the Scottish Funding Council (SFC)<br />• Parallel development of the REF 2021 submission and Institutional Level and UoA Level future 5 year Strategy (Environment).<br />• Research Centre annual reviews of current and future compliance and feedback from Research Strategy Committee.<br />• Discussions with professional service providers (HR, Library, Finance, RKEDU, Technical Staff). Input from Trade Unions.<br />• Inputs from our Professoriate, 2 Schools and 6 Research Centres They in turn consulted with a range of team members.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback from researchers included:</strong></p>
<p>• Opportunity for researchers to input into the Strategic Plan 2020-25 via a World Café led by the Principal and SLT.<br />• QMU has been an early adopter of CEDARS and is using real time feedback to inform policy/ strategy development.<br />• Survey of all academic staff in 2019 and series of researcher focus groups to understand potential barriers to research in protected groups. Data collected informs our approach to<br />ensuring our processes eliminate bias and promote equality.<br />• Bi annual meetings with the Deputy Principal and CRS, Head of Graduate School held open space/drop-ins with PGRs.<br />• Collaboration in shared practice with Scottish HEIs via SFC UIF Collaborative Groups and Universities Scotland Sub-Groups.<br />• Informal External Peer Review by Buddy HEI - Research and Innovation Services – University of Stirling.</p>
<p><strong>Links with existing Quality Assurance and other implementation/monitoring mechanisms:</strong></p>
<p>• Internal monitoring at an institutional level via dedicated operational delivery plan and KPIs reported to the University Court.<br />• Institutional KPIs for Centres monitored for compliance with the Concordat and supporting CRS - reported to RSC and Court.<br />• Alignment with REF 2021 metrics/ Environment statements -monitor via the REF 2021 underpinning audit process.<br />• Compliance integral to SFC monitoring of our Outcome Agreement 2017-20 and 2020-23 and annual UIF statement.</p>
