      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. Right to Academic Appeal</strong></p>
<p>An 'appeal' is a request for a review of a decision of a Board of Examiners that has been charged with decisions on student progression, assessment and awards. The appeal may be in respect of any decision that affects the student’s grade or progress.</p>
<p><strong>2. Nature of the appeal</strong></p>
<p>Those hearing the appeal will not attempt to re-examine the student, nor to appraise the professional judgement of the examiners, but will consider whether the decision of the Board of Examiners was fair, and whether all relevant factors were taken into account.</p>
<p><strong>3. Time limit</strong></p>
<p>The appeal must be submitted in writing to the University Secretary within twenty-one days of the publication of the decision of the Board of Examiners, or receipt of the academic transcript.</p>
<p>An extension to this time limit will be permitted only in exceptional circumstances e.g. when, for reasons outside their control, a student did not receive timely notification of their result.</p>

Appeals on the grounds of extenuating circumstances will not be accepted where there is evidence that the circumstances that form the basis of the submission could have been submitted to the EC Panel by the published deadline, and the student has no grounds for not submitting by that deadline.</p>\n<p>4.4       A student’s disagreement with the academic judgement of a Board of Examiners does not provide a valid ground for appeal.</p>\n<p>4.5       Any student considering an appeal is encouraged to contact the Students’ Union for advice and assistance.</p>"

The Dean of School will normally respond to the student within 21 days of receipt of the appeal, either giving a decision or specifying a date for the decision. This timescale may be extended where the Dean of School is absent from the University through leave or illness.</p>\n<p>5.4     The Dean will produce a report that documents fully the issues raised by the appellant, the facts established by the investigation, and the manner in which the facts were used to inform the judgement. The Dean of School will provide a copy of the response to the University Secretary. In coming to a judgment, the Dean may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>confirm the decision of the Board of Examiners, on the grounds that the evidence presented did not support the case;</li>\n<li>provide the appellant with an additional first or second diet of examination, as the case may be, provided that, in upholding the appeal and granting an additional diet, the terms of the University’s Assessment Regulations are taking into consideration; or</li>\n<li>should it not be possible to provide an additional diet for the appealed result, to provide a suitable alternative as the Dean thinks fit and is reasonable in all the circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5.5     If a reconsideration of the student’s case gives rise to a change in the student’s progression, this must be ratified, depending on how material the changes are, by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Convener of the Board of Examiners;</li>\n<li>the Convener of the Board of Examiners and the External Examiner/s;</li>\n<li>all the members of the Board of Examiners by correspondence;</li>\n<li>a meeting of a subset of the Board;</li>\n<li>a meeting of the full Board of Examiners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5.6     The University Secretary, in consultation with the Dean of School, will determine the most suitable of those identified above to deal with the matter, and the procedure to be followed thereafter.</p>"

Normally the student will have to tell the Ombudsman about their complaint within 12 months of first knowing about the problem about which they are complaining, although the Ombudsman may look at complaints outside this limit if they think there is good reason to do so.</p>\n<p>8.3     There are some restrictions on what the Ombudsman can investigate. For example they cannot consider the subject matter of complaints about personnel matters or matters of academic judgement. However they may be able to investigate the manner in which the complaint was handled. If the complaint is appropriate to their office and is investigated, the Ombudsman’s staff will send details of how this will be done.</p>\n<p>8.4     The complaint should be submitted in writing to the Ombudsman, and should include any relevant documents, including correspondence with the University and the University’s response to the complaint. This can be sent to the Ombudsman without cost at the freepost address given below. A student may discuss the complaint with an Investigator at the SPSO before deciding to submit.</p>\n<p>8.5     The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman has an online complaint form accessible through the website although papers in support of the complaint would still have to be supplied to the Ombudsman by post or other means. The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman can also supply paper complaint forms direct to complainants.</p>\n<p>8.6     Further information may be accessed through the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman website or by calling their office for advice.
