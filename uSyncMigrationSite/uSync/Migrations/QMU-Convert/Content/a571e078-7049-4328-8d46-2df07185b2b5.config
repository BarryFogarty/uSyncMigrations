Previously he has worked at London South Bank University, University of Westminster and most recently at Bath Spa University. He held several leadership positions at Bath Spa University.</p>\n<p>He has a BSc (Hons) in Chemistry, an MSc in Food Technology (Process Engineering Option) from Reading University and a PhD from London Southbank University, where he developed a time-temperature indicator for stored food using enzymes extracted from bananas.</p>\n<p>He is a chartered scientist and a Fellow of the Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFST) and a Fellow of the Higher Education academy (HEA) He is an active member of the IFST and a member of the Food group of the Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). He has been an external examiner at several UK institutions.</p>\n<p>He is an academic entrepreneur with outstanding lecturing, management and leadership qualities. His teaching interests include food processing, food product development, food packaging and research methodologies. His research interests lie in the area of food product and process development, functional ingredients, development of smart labels and industrial applications of immobilised enzymes.</p>\n<p>Anil is also interested in the public understanding of science. His work on development of time-temperature indicators has been supported in the past by a MAFF (now DEFRA) (1998-2000) (100,735) grant and has involved industrial partners (Safeway Stores, Northern Foods and Field group). He has also successfully supervised a PhD in this area. He has presented his work both at national and international conferences. He has been a partner in a NATO Collaborative Linkage grant on 'Applications of Magnetisable Particles/ Fluids in Human and Veterinary Medicine'.  He has also won a Nuffield award for his work on the Microbial properties of Kokum (<em>Garcinia Indica</em>).</p>\n<p>Whilst he was at Bath Spa University, he was the lead applicant  for the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (Modular Training Partnerships scheme) funded (£20,000) project and led the  development of  M level training in Food Quality and Safety for industry with industry (Marshfield Bakery, Lucozade Ribena Suntory, Wyke Farms, Apetito, Sandridge Farmhouse Bacon, The Real Olive Company, Yum.com (umbrella company for Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell) and Martin-Brower UK Ltd  were part of the Advisory and development group).</p>\n<p>Dr de Sequeira is also a Fellow of the Institute of Food Science and Technology (<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ifst.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IFST Website\">IFST</a>), <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://sciencecouncil.org/scientists-science-technicians/which-professional-award-is-right-for-me/csci/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chartered Science - Science Council Website\">Chartered Scientist</a>, Member of the Society of Chemical Industry (<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.soci.org/interest-groups/food\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SOCI Website\">Food Group</a>), Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Advance Higher Education Website\">Advance HE)</a>.</p>"
