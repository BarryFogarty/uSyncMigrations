<p><strong>Course:</strong> BSc (Hones) Psychology</p>
<p><strong>Year of Study:</strong> Year 1</p>
<p><strong>Hometown &amp; Country: </strong>Turkmenistan</p>
<p><strong>What has been the highlight of your time at QMU so far?</strong></p>
<p>The highlight of my time at QMU has been the opportunity to meet new people and form lasting friendships. Meeting people from different places and adapting to a new environment has been a positively enriching experience for me, thanks to QMU. It's been wonderful to connect at different events like those at Maggie's or the ones organised by ResLife and gather with all the students every Thursday for a free evening meal provided by the “Thank Goodness It's Thursday”. Engaging in these activities involving fellow students has been enjoyable and also fostered a strong sense of community!</p>
<p>Additionally, discussing various topics relevant to the field in the seminars and lectures with our friendly and knowledgeable lecturers has been invaluable in expanding my knowledge and perspectives!</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing you wish you knew before coming to university at QMU?</strong></p>
<p>One thing I wish I had known before coming to university at QMU is the strong sense of community and the welcoming atmosphere fostered by the staff, lecturers, and fellow students. From the beginning, the staff and lecturers have been incredibly friendly and approachable, serving not just as educators but as mentors genuinely interested in our growth and success. Their open-door policy and willingness to help, whether with coursework or career advice, have created a warm and supportive environment that makes studying here truly enriching. Discovering the <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/7e1143f117dd413d957dd00a848b51ca}" title="PALS (Peer Assisted Learning) at QMU">Peer Assisted Learning Scheme (PALS)</a> later on was invaluable, providing valuable insights and guidance for our assessments from peers from higher years.</p>
<p>At QMU, you never feel alone! There's always a sense of belonging and support available that makes the university feel like a second home. This sense of community has made my time here incredibly fulfilling and I am grateful for the connections and friendships I've formed along the way!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your favourite thing about being an ambassador for QMU?</strong></p>
<p>My favourite aspect of being an ambassador for QMU is the opportunity to share my passion for this incredible university with prospective students. I enjoy being able to convey the diverse learning opportunities, the supportive community, and the welcoming atmosphere that makes QMU truly special.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for the chance to offer guidance and support to prospective students. I remember how stressful and overwhelming it can be to prepare for your journey at university, so I understand the importance of addressing any concerns or questions they may have. Being an ambassador allows me to share my experiences and ensure that future students feel confident and excited about the opportunities that await them at QMU!</p>]]></Value>
