      "content": "<p>The science of nutrition employs evidence-based approaches to highlight the relationship between our diet and health, and it enables us to optimise health and prevent disease. The science of nutrition is concerned with how food affects the functioning of the living organism. It includes the study of food composition, how it is digested and absorbed, the production of energy, elimination of wastes and all the syntheses that are essential for growth, maintenance, and reproduction across the life cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:<br /></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn the academic principles behind food and gain practical skills in our advanced laboratories;</li>\n<li>learn how to think critically on a larger scale. What are the social, political, cultural and environmental factors affecting what we eat? How do nutritionists use evidence-based approaches to optimise health, prevent disease, and support behaviour change at an individual, community and population level?; and</li>\n<li>learn about the most current issues in the field of nutrition. For example, how does our gut microbiome composition impact our health? How do nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics influence current practice? What are the current/contemporary practices and policies in the field of nutrition?</li>\n</ul>"

Nutritionists may choose to work in areas of public health nutrition, clinical nutrition, sport and exercise nutrition, academia and research, food development and consultancy, private nutrition practice, and coaching.</p>\n<p>For example, nutritionists may work within community settings or local authority public health teams with a focus on health promotion and policy. Depending on the role, their work might range from creating, delivering and evaluating a range of practical and educational food-based policies and initiatives to encourage healthy lifestyle change, to providing nutritional information for food production and to secure approval for health claims on packaging. Nutritionists also provide specialist advice for preventing specific diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Type-2 diabetes and cancer, or they may provide advice on healthy eating to particular client groups (for example nutritional advice during pregnancy, infancy or older adulthood). Other areas of practice include, but are not limited to, working with athletes and sports teams, or working in the food sector, for example in quality management or nutritional analysis.</p>\n<p>Our graduates work across a number of sectors including government, academia, third-sector and private companies.
