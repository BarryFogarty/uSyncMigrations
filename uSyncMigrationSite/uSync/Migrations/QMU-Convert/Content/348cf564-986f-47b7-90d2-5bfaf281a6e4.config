An example may be of a student who has difficulty reading from a screen and requires to print off a high volume of course materials, in doing so, the student is probably paying much more to access these than a non-disabled classmate.</p>\n<p>DSA support can only be sourced by application to the relevant <strong>Funding Authority</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>To be eligible for DSA students must:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide appropriate evidence of disability</li>\n<li>meet certain residency requirements</li>\n<li>be on a course that is recognised by their Funding Authority</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DSA Applications to Funding Authorities require a completed application form, appropriate evidence and a DSA Needs Assessment Report.</p>\n<p>If you think you may be eligible for DSA, please contact the <a href=\"mailto:DisabilityAdvisers@qmu.ac.uk\">Disability Service</a> and speak with a Disability Adviser.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">More information about the Disabled Students’ Allowance</span></p>\n<p>DSA can provide eligible students with a range of items including equipment, software, one-to-one support and additional funds.</p>\n<p>The decision about what items are most appropriate is made during a <strong>DSA Needs Assessment</strong> where eligible students meet a DSA Needs Assessor to explore the impact of their disability on learning. Appropriate strategies to support individual issues are fully discussed. The DSA Needs Assessor writes a report for the relevant Funding Authority identifying recommended supports. A DSA Needs Assessment Report is only released to the Funding Authority according to student agreement.</p>\n<p>For most eligible QMU students, DSA Needs Assessments can be arranged at the Queen Margaret University Needs Assessment Centre.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Funding Authorities: links to DSA </strong> </span></p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.saas.gov.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS)</a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas\" target=\"_blank\">Student Finance England (SFE)</a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk#.Wpf0rTi7Lbg\" target=\"_blank\" data-anchor=\"#.Wpf0rTi7Lbg\">Student Finance Wales</a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Student Finance Northern Ireland (SFNI)</a></p>"

Students may also find it helpful to disclose basic information to academic departments to ensure they receive the best possible support. One example might be telling lecturers that they have an Individual Learning Plan and are allowed to record lectures; another might be that they may need to miss classes on occasion as a result of a medical condition that necessitates hospital appointments.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Will it say ‘dyslexic’ or ‘disabled’ on my degree certificate?</span></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Do I have to request assessment/examination arrangements every year?</span></p>\n<p>No, not unless you interrupt your studies, change your course, or your requirements change.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Will I get extensions on my coursework deadlines once I’ve been to see you?</span></p>\n<p>Extensions to deadlines are only possible if this is an adjustment included in your Individual Learning Plan.</p>\n<p>ILP extensions can only be for a maximum of 7 days. For longer course-work extensions you need to discuss your circumstances with relevant academic staff.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Do I have to apply for the Disabled Students’ Allowance every year? </span></p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Do I have to return equipment provided through the Disabled Students' Allowance?</span></p>\n<p>No, it is yours to keep provided you do not withdraw from your course in the year of your first DSA award. If you withdraw in that year, your Funding Authority may contact you regarding the award.</p>\n<p>Different rules apply for students from the Republic of Ireland on undergraduate courses.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Is it a good idea to disclose my disability or specific learning difficulty on job application forms?</span></p>\n<p>Many students ask us this question. Legally, employers cannot discriminate against disabled people and it is advisable to let employers know if you have a disability that may affect your performance at an interview; for example, if you are visually impaired they will need to send the directions for the interview electronically or in large print.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that a potential employer may be worried about how to support a member of staff with a disability, so they’ll be looking to you for advice. If you have an existing strategy which works - maybe you work effectively with specialist software to hear text read aloud - let them know. You are then providing them with a ready-made solution.</p>\n<p>Completing a degree course with a disability will tell a future employer that you have worked hard and shown creativity and initiative by working around obstacles. As such, a good employer should view it as a positive attribute.</p>"
