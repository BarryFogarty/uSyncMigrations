      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Jose (level 2, Dietetics), Charlotte Somerville (level 4, Business Management), Maria Grenman (level 3, Media) and Julija Lukaityte (level 3, PR, Marketing &amp; Events) have driven forward this year’s campaign to achieve record student attendance.</p>
<p>Run by QMU’s Careers and Employability team, the WOW events are designed to offer students from all areas of study the opportunity to learn from careers professionals and employers about all aspects of graduate and student employment.</p>
<p>WOW events encourage and promote ways for students to enhance their career prospects whilst at QMU. The event series also introduces students to possible career routes and allows them to engage with and learn from other students across all subject areas.</p>
<p>Each year, QMU’s Careers and Employability team recruits a team of talented QMU students to help promote WOW events and encourage other students to attend. Reporting to the Careers and Employability team, the student marketing officers are responsible for devising and carrying out a marketing campaign for the WOW events.</p>
<p>Commenting on their experience as WOW Marketing Officers, this year’s team said:</p>
<p>Maria Grenman: “I wanted to get involved in WOW because I think it’s such a great concept, and I think it’s fantastic that our Uni puts in the effort of organising these tailor-made sessions for student every year! Being part of the WOW team was a really fun and educating experience. I really loved working with my team, learned a lot coming up with new ideas and strategies for marketing WOW and making new friends in the process.</p>
<p>“I would recommend applying to be a WOW Marketing Officer because it’s a really good way to experience what it would be like to work for a company in a marketing position, but in a very safe and supportive environment.”</p>
<p>Julija Lukaityte: “I applied for the role to gain some practical experience and to simply get more involved at university life. I believe that a lot of the students at QMU are not familiar with the benefits offered by the careers centre. This was a great opportunity to prove the fact that students can actually develop their professional skills outside the regular classrooms.</p>
<p>“I would definitely recommend it for students from School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management. They would be able to implement their knowledge in practice. This is a fun experience which also results in having a great job title in your CV!”</p>
<p>Charlotte Somerville: “'I applied to be a WOW marketing officer as I wanted to gain first hand experience of conducting a marketing campaign. The role taught me many transferable skills such as time management, team work, organisation and responsibility as the campaign is your project and you decide how it is best done. I would highly recommend applying to be a WOW marketing officer as even if you are not successful, the recruitment stage gives invaluable experience into assessment centres, competency interviews and full feedback is provided.”</p>
