Thirst for more details about QMU’s PALM-ALT meant that our food experts were handling media interviews and commercial responses from dawn until dusk for several weeks. The level of interest shows how much research like this is needed by the global community to ensure a sustainable future for all.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, as palm shortening is ubiquitous in commercial bakery products, we expected that our PALM-ALT product would be met with great excitement across the food industry. Due to palm oil’s extensive application across a range of industries, there was global interest from small specialist food manufacturers and large-scale food producers, as well as retailers, investors and media outlets, to name but a few.</p>
<p>But with QMU’s research focus on the application of PALM-ALT in bakery products, why is our new novel ingredient looking like a game changer for the food industry? To understand that we must first look at palm oil.</p>
<p><strong>What is palm shortening?</strong></p>
<p>Palm shortening is a major functional fat ingredient used widely across the food industry in products such as cakes, biscuits, pastries, confectionery, ready meals and sauces. Due to its composition, high yield and low production costs, the food industry has become increasingly dependent on palm, resulting in its over-cultivation. Its high saturated fat content, which allows it to remain solid at room temperature, has proven very functional to the industrial bakery sector.</p>
<p><strong>What makes PALM-ALT a winner?</strong></p>
<p>Working successfully as a replacement for palm-based fat in baked goods, the newly developed ingredient, which has significantly less saturated fat, allows goods, such as cakes and biscuits, to maintain their texture, flavour and colour.</p>
<p>If used in the food industry to replace palm shortening, PALM-ALT has the potential to significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the impact of food miles and deforestation of global<br>rainforests associated with palm production. The use of PALM-ALT in the food industry could reduce its reliance on the over-cultivation of palm.</p>
<p><strong>What QMU’s research confirms</strong></p>
<p>With a semi solid consistency, PALM-ALT is palm and coconut free, 100% plant-based, healthier due to having less total and saturated fat, and more sustainable. It’s not only better for the environment, it’s also a wholesome, clean label, allergen-free product with no added flavourings, sugar, sweeteners, preservatives or colourings. The QMU team has successfully trialed the PALM-ALT with biscuits, shortbread, oatcakes, cookies, cake and bread.</p>
<p><strong>Who's behind the research?</strong></p>
<p>Dr Julien Lonchamp, Reader in Food Science, and Catriona Liddle, Head of the Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation (SCFDI) at Queen Margaret University.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation for the project</strong></p>
<p>The industry has found it difficult to identify another fat which delivers the cost benefits and physical characteristics (bland taste, food shelf-life and ambient storage) that palm offers, and which is not linked<br>with health concerns. Currently there is no palm fat replacement that is sustainable, healthy and cost-effective.</p>
<p>Dr Julien Lonchamp said:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="We set out to develop a new ingredient
that would provide winning solutions for the bakery industry. We used our expertise in food applications to assist the industry to develop baked goods that are both healthier and better for the environment than palm shortening and other current available alternatives." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p><strong>What’s next for the PALM-ALT research project?</strong></p>
<p>The research team has patented the product and secured funds from Scottish Enterprise High Growth Spin Out Programme - Opportunity Qualification to assess whether company creation will be a viable next step in this project journey. The team is currently seeking a partner to manufacture PALM-ALT.</p>
<p><strong>Signing off</strong></p>
<p>Catriona Liddle confirmed: “It is very satisfying to have developed a product which delivers on so many different levels for the food industry, satisfies the growing consumer market for tasty healthy<br>foods, can support local economies, and is kinder to the environment with none of the deforestation issues currently associated with palm cultivation.</p>
<p><strong>THE FACTS - PALM-ALT</strong></p>
<p>is healthier than palm oil – with 25% less fat and 88%<br>less saturated fat;<br>• free from all 14 top food allergens;<br>• has no added sugar, sweeteners, flavourings or colourings;<br>• is 100% plant based, clean-label, and coconut free;<br>• all the materials in PALM-ALT can be sourced from within the EU and UK;<br>• includes a by-product from the linseed industry, fibre and rapeseed oil, which can be produced locally and<br>has the potential to be produced at global scale;<br>• has the potential to significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions when compared with palm oil by reducing<br>the impact of food miles; and<br>• can contribute to reducing deforestation of rainforests associated with palm cultivation.</p>]]></Value>
