      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Have you used any QMU services to help you through your student journey?</span></p>
<p>I'm dyslexic, so the University has helped me sort out my SAAS funding and helped me to apply for the disability allowance. They also provide study skills sessions where I meet with a tutor, and they help me with whatever I need, such as reading through journals and essay plans and keeping me on track with my course work. Student Services also helped me get extra support with my assessments due to my dyslexia, such as extra time in any assessments that this may impact. The PAT (Personal Academic Tutor) system is also great as you have a direct link to one of your lecturers to help you with everything; I've spoken to mine a lot about assessments and deadlines to ensure I am up to date with it all or just to clear things up if I'm a bit confused about something. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What's your 'top tip' for making the most of being a student?</span></p>
<p>Don't be embarrassed to speak out in classes; no one will judge you. You are all there for the same thing, to learn and to make the most of the experience. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What are your plans for after graduation?</span></p>
<p>I might continue with my studies, although I'm not sure what I'll do just yet as I'm waiting to see where this course will take me. Plus, I've had such a good experience that I don't think I'm ready to stop being a student any time soon!</p>]]></Value>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose QMU?</span></p>
<p>I chose to study at QMU as it was the only university that offered the type of course I was looking for – one that looks into community education and the psychology and sociology that impacts it. The lecturers were all so welcoming, which really helped me settle into the course. QMU's campus being just a six-minute train journey to Edinburgh city centre is also fantastic as it means that I have no issues getting there via public transport. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What have you most enjoyed about your course? </span></p>
<p>I've enjoyed a lot of the course but mainly the different view of education that we get to see and understand, not only focusing on how education works within schools but in different communities. My highlight so far would have to be learning British Sign Language as part of my studies. </p>
<p><span class="lead">Has there been a particular course activity you found especially interesting?</span></p>
<p>The placements were varied and interesting. I was unsure what I was in for in a community-based education setting, but it was an excellent opportunity to experience the things we learn in lectures first-hand. </p>
<p><span class="lead">How have your lecturers supported your learning?</span></p>
<p>The lecturers are amazing when it comes to supporting us and always reply to emails – no matter how silly the questions are! They are also great within seminars and always make sure we follow along and give us the opportunity to speak out and ask questions. </p>
<p><span class="lead">Any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></p>
<p>Just do it! I was unsure myself when I first applied, but I am so glad I did as it has allowed me to make new friends, has provided me with loads of different opportunities and allowed me to study a subject I love. </p>]]></Value>
