      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>THANKS TO THE use of virtual reality (VR) technology, students on the BSc Paramedic Science course at QMU are benefitting from a totally immersive experience in the classroom, and they are loving every minute of their new virtual world.</strong></p>
<p>Trialling the new VR packages for the first time, student Bronte Haywood said:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="It was slightly disorienting because it was so real. I got so invested in the scenario that when someone spoke to me outside the VR headset, I got a fright." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>Using VR technology under the skillful direction of her lecturer, 2nd year student Lisa Fernie said: “I was totally amazed at how immersive and realistic the experience felt. It was so exciting, as I’d never used VR technology before.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Leading the development of the new VR packages, QMU lecturer, Alex Williams, is delighted that the various scenarios that he has created, are proving to be massive hit with the students.</p>
<p>By simply popping on a VR headset, students are immediately transported from a bland classroom into a bedroom of a modern flat where a young women, sitting in the edge of a bed, is clearly suffering from labour complications. Observing, asking questions, using virtual equipment and decision making all become part of the very realistic VR experience. The student can immediately feel the stress of the situation – but they<br>can learn to ask the right questions, undertake the correct assessments, and challenge their decision making. No-one is going to die if they make a mistake, and Alex, as the experienced professional, is there to guide them through the various VR scenarios, so they are better equipped for the real thing.</p>
<p>As part of a range of packages, students have the chance to experience different situations, from a pregnant women with pre-eclampsia to a female with maternal sepsis, and from a baby with shoulder distortia dystocia (stuck in birth canal) to a woman with postpartum hemorrhaging. It’s all possible with VR!</p>
<p>Student Euan Baillie said: “There is no doubt that VR has a significant positive impact on the learning experience at QMU - providing a very unique way to practice and apply skills in a realistic environment<br>that you can’t necessarily practice whilst on placement or in normal classroom settings. It allows us to repeatedly practice skills until the mental processing required for performing these tasks is reduced to a minimum. This frees up our mental capacity to focus on making relevant decisions in real-life emergency<br>situations.”</p>
<p>Bronte concluded: “It was so clever and exciting to see the future of paramedic practice learning advancing to help us to become better, more confident practitioners that can give the best care to patients. The possibilities for VR in paramedic science seem endless for current undergraduate students, as well as for the professional development of qualified paramedics in the field.”  </p>]]></Value>
