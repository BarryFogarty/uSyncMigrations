      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The new Director of Academic Development and Learning Enhancement will provide strategic leadership of the enhancement of learning, teaching and assessment across the portfolio of the University, including our domestic and international collaborative partnerships and online learning portfolio. Professor Catriona Bell (BVetMed, PhD, PFHEA, NTF, MRCVS), who takes up the role on 26 October, comes to QMU from Advance HE, where she has served as Head of Membership for Scotland and Senior Advisor in Learning and Teaching since February 2019, and with more than 20 years academic experience at two Russell Group universities, latterly as a Reader in Veterinary Education.</p>
<p>Professor Bell has gained the highest level of professional recognition for learning and teaching, becoming a Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (PFHEA) in 2015 and a National Teaching Fellow (NTF) in 2018, the first year that the NTF scheme ran in Scotland. She is also a qualified veterinary surgeon who lives in East Lothian and enjoys wildlife watching (both at home and abroad) in her spare time.</p>
<p>Professor David Stevenson took up the permanent role of Dean of ASSAM on 1 September 2021 after interim management of the School through the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted his problem solving, influencing, and communication skills, a position he held while continuing his role as Director of the Centre for Communication, Cultural and Media Studies (CCCMS) and the Unit of Assessment Lead (UoA 34) for REF 2021.</p>
<p>Prior to his current role, Professor Stevenson was Head of QMU's Media, Communication, and Performing Arts (MCPA) division. During this time, the division moved up the league tables, in particular within the subject area of Drama Dance and Cinematics, which in 2019-20 saw MCPA reach its highest ever positions – coming 6th in the UK out of 101 in the Times Good University Guide (up 62 places in four years) and 3rd in the UK Good University Guide.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Butt, Deputy Principal of Queen Margaret University, said: "We are delighted to announce the appointment of Professor Catriona Bell and Professor David Stevenson to their new roles within the University.  Together, they will play a key part in shaping the future design and delivery of our academic portfolio, ensuring it continues to offer a high quality learning experience for students that equips them with the knowledge and skills sought by employers.”</p>]]></Value>
