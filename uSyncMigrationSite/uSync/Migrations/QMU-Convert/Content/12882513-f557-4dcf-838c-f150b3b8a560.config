      <Value><![CDATA[<p>You <strong>may</strong> be able to gain RPL credit for previous certificated study, undertaken elsewhere (see section 3.2). You also may be able to gain academic credit for experience; for example, experience gained through volunteering, or in your workplace (see section 3.3).</p>
<p>For learning to be awarded as credit towards your programme of study, it needs to match learning outcomes and to be evidenced. This guidance explains some of the key terms and the processes followed by QMU. The guidance has been developed to ensure parity and consistency when considering claims for credit for prior learning.</p>]]></Value>

      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\">2.1 Specific Academic Credit</span> can be applied for when specifically matched against the learning outcomes for a module(s) of a QMU programme. Specific academic credit is normally matched against a whole module. There may be occasions where previous academic credit gained out with the QMU programme matches the learning outcomes for a specific module component and therefore partial matching (usually exemption from one element of assessment) may be applied for.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.2 General Academic Credit</span> is the term for academic credit points applied for at a particular SCQF level but not matched to specific module outcomes.</p>\n<p>This would usually be applied for:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>where module exemptions are sought at a specific level of study or;</li>\n<li>where direct entry through advanced standing is granted to a specific level of study (e.g., direct entry to Level 2 of a programme). This general academic credit may be deemed acceptable for the named award but does not specifically match QMU named modules (see section 3)</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.3 Academic Credit Frameworks</span><br />There are numerous <a href=\"https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/64561.4196.html\">academic credit frameworks</a>. Using these frameworks allows comparison between qualifications gained through different systems. The frameworks most encountered in the UK include:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.3.1 Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This is the credit framework used at QMU and across Scotland. It means that we can be confident that 20 credits at Level 7 (first year undergraduate) credits from another Scottish institution are equivalent to 20 credits at Level 7 (first year undergraduate degree) credits here at QMU.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.3.2 Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework for Wales (CQFW)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">RQF is the English Qualification Framework and CQFW is the Welsh Credit and Qualifications Framework that allows us to benchmark qualifications based on size and level. These frameworks allow comparison between qualifications gained in different areas of the UK.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.3.3 European Credit Transfer Scheme (ECTS)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This is the same principle as the SCQF but is Europe wide. 10 credits on the SCQF are equal to 5 credits on the ECTS.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2.3.4. National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">NARIC is a group that matches international qualifications and UK qualifications. This enables us to be confident that an Undergraduate Diploma in Singapore is broadly equivalent to completing Level 9 (year 3) study in the UK, for example. NARIC equivalence is usually ascertained by Admissions department colleagues prior to a student being admitted to a programme.</p>"

      "content": "<p>There are three main types of Recognition of Prior Learning.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.1 Advanced Standing</span></p>\n<p>Applications for Advanced Standing normally relate to the Admissions process for a specific programme where as RPCL/RPEL are essentially exemption from modules/components and not programmes.</p>\n<p>Advanced Standing applies when learning that can be evidenced allows entry to a programme at a later point than the usual admissions point (e.g., directly into Level 2 of an undergraduate programme or directly into the final 120 credits of study in a Masters degree where a student has a Post Graduate Certificate).</p>\n<p>Advanced Standing for some programmes may be captured by a group agreement that has been drawn up by the Programme Leader or Collaborative Academic Lead <strong>AND</strong> an appropriate person from the Division of Registry and Academic Administration (e.g., School Manager).</p>\n<p>Numerous examples of individual applications for Advanced Standing exist. For example, a student with a Higher National Diploma (HND) in a relevant subject may apply for entry with Advanced Standing into year two or three of a relevant degree, depending on the extent of shared subject matter covered in the HND.</p>\n<p><em>Entry to a programme via Advanced Standing <strong>must be notified</strong> to the RPL Panel Secretary on <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/e019f6b6d1e148fe9af783c23906090a}\" title=\"RPL Application Form Advanced Standing\"><strong>RPL form-AS</strong></a> in order for the academic credit to be added to the student record.</em></p>\n<p><br /><span class=\"lead\">3.2. Recognition of Prior Certificated Learning (RPCL)</span></p>\n<p>RPCL refers to learning that has previously been assessed and certificated by a Further/Higher Education Institution or training provider. Applications for Recognition of Prior Certificated Learning can only be considered for already matriculated students.</p>\n<p>RPCL applies when a student can provide appropriate evidence of academic learning by provision of relevant documentation. This would normally include student transcripts, module descriptors indicating <a href=\"https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/64561.4196.html\">recognised academic level of study</a> (e.g. SCQF; RQF, CQFW, ECTS), and evidence of matching either specific or general academic credit (see section 2.1 and <em><strong>RPL form-AS/RCPL</strong></em>). Depending on the evidence provided a challenge essay may also be required, to meet the requirements of entry to a programme.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Partial Matching of Module Components</strong></p>\n<p>There may be occasions where previous academic credit gained out with the QMU programme matches the learning outcomes for a specific module component and therefore partial matching (usually exemption from one element of assessment) may be applied. In this situation, the student will pay a reduced module fee.</p>\n<p>Students are required to complete <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/6587c6d860fc424aa72bdb715a211c7a}\" title=\"RPL Application Form Prior Certificated Learning\"><strong><em>RPL form-RPCL</em></strong></a>, this includes a section to be completed by the Programme Leader indicating how the application has been reviewed, how the credit applied for matches against specific or general credit, and a recommendation detailing the element to assessed to the RPL Panel.</p>\n<p><em>Applications for RPCL <strong>must be notified</strong> to the RPL Panel Secretary on <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/6587c6d860fc424aa72bdb715a211c7a}\" title=\"RPL Application Form Prior Certificated Learning\"><strong>RPL form-RPCL</strong></a> for the academic credit to be added to the student record.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Partial Matching of Learning Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p>Where previous academic credit gained out with the QMU programme does not match all the learning outcomes for a specific module/component a student may be asked to complete an additional piece of coursework.</p>\n<p>Students should be aware that the submission of an additional piece of work in relation to a Recognition of Prior Certificated Learning (RPCL) process requires considerable student effort. In addition, it involves academic supervision, assessment and a fee may be charged.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Step 1</strong></em></p>\n<p>Students are required to complete <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/6587c6d860fc424aa72bdb715a211c7a}\" title=\"RPL Application Form Prior Certificated Learning\"><em><strong>RPL form-RPCL</strong></em></a>, this includes a section to be completed by the Programme Leader indicating how the application has been reviewed, how the credit applied for matches against specific or general credit, and a recommendation to the RPL Panel of the additional piece of coursework that must be completed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Step 2</strong></em></p>\n<p>Once the student has completed the additional piece of coursework this should be reviewed and feedback provided on <em><strong>RPL feedback sheet</strong></em> – RPCL to the Panel, and the appropriate academic credit will be added to their student record.</p>\n<p>If a student does not successfully complete the additional piece of coursework, they will have <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>one</strong></span> further attempt to resubmit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.3 Recognition of Prior Experiential Learning (RPEL)</span></p>\n<p>Learning which has been achieved outside a formal experience with an education or training provider may be appropriate to use in a Recognition for Prior Experiential Learning (RPEL) claim. This type of learning may be gained through voluntary or workplace experiences.</p>\n<p>Applications for RPEL can only be considered for already matriculated students. Students are always advised to seek academic guidance regarding how to best submit an RPEL claim – e.g., for a large amount of credit (over 40 credits), it is often easier to partition the work into different “packages” to allow depth and focus to be evidenced.</p>\n<p>Students should be aware that the RPEL process requires considerable student effort. In addition, it involves academic supervision, student work and an assessment, and therefore there is an associated fee, as per publication on the University website. Students and academic supervisors are required to familiarise themselves with the timelines of RPL Panel meetings in order that appropriate deadlines are met, and students are facilitated in their RPEL claim and overall student journey.</p>\n<p>Applications for RPEL follow a two-stage process:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong></p>\n<p>Must be notified to the RPL Panel Secretary on <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/04fdf79c0f9f46f0ba6f184aa00879e5}\" title=\"RPL Application Form Prior Experiential Learning\"><em><strong>RPL form-RPEL</strong></em></a> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">at least two weeks</span> ahead of RPL Panel dates for the RPL Panel to scrutinise the application. If approval is granted, <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/781a0772d20b4e7091629a2db90d5926}\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">an RPEL fee</a> is charged and students can progress to Stage 2, which involves preparation and submission of a package of work to evidence learning. The RPL Panel normally identifies the package, but indications, from the Programme Leader, of potentially appropriate work in the Stage 1 application are welcomed.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>\n<p>Concludes with submission of work by the student, to an agreed timeline, and the work is assessed, and feedback provided on <em><strong>RPL feedback sheet–RPEL</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete Stage 2 will have the appropriate academic credit added to their student record.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/8c151e94150c43f6b2aad09230f624ec}\" title=\"RPL Examples of Completed Forms\">sample of exemplar RPL applications</a> is available to provide guidance on how to complete these forms.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Section 3 has identified the three main processes whereby RPL can be claimed. However, there is a maximum amount of academic credit which can be claimed through RPL.</p>\n<p>The maximum allowed under QMU regulations is up to 50% of the level at which they enter a programme.</p>\n<p>It must also be noted that students are not able to use the same credit twice for the same programme. This is classed as double counting, an example of this is when the recognition of prior learning (and credit) that has already resulted in the award of a qualification similar to, or the same as, the qualification which the student is seeking to be awarded. Another example of double counting is the awarding of credit for the same learning to two (or more) separate qualifications at the same level. In effect, providing two qualifications ‘for the price of one’.</p>\n<p>The University does not consider double counting to be educationally desirable or defensible and so will not permit RPL to be used for that purpose.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/1e6713b4f34f412d89e603bd865ccdfc}\" title=\"Registration Regulations\">Full details available from the Registration regulations</a>.</p>\n<p>In exceptional circumstances, generally on professional programmes, there may be programme specific circumstances which affect how RPL is used (e.g., specific elements in the V300 Independent and Supplementary Prescribing for Health Care Professionals module.)</p>"
