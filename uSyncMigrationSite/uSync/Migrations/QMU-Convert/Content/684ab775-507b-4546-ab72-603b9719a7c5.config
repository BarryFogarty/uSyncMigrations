      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Can you accept a C in Higher English?</strong></span></p>\n<p>No. Applicants must have achieved/be predicted a B at Higher. Even for LEAPS &amp; WP applicants we are unable to lower the requirement to a C.</p>\n<p>If studying on a SWAP Access course, applicants may meet the English requirement with the content of their course without taking Higher English. If in doubt please email admissions with details of your specific course so this can be checked.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What level of Maths</strong> <strong>do I need?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Like English, it is a GTCS requirement that applicants have the required level of Maths. Applicants must have National 5 Maths at a grade C or above. Lifeskills/Applications of Maths are acceptable. Numeracy or Nat 4 is not accepted.</p>\n<p>An Access course might cover sufficient Maths units but this will need to be checked. If applicants are unsure whether their qualification is suitable we suggest contacting admissions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What SWAP Access courses</strong> <strong>do you accept?</strong></span></p>\n<p>We will consider a number of SWAP Access courses for entry, you can find out more details on the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://swapsurvey.org/progression/east\" target=\"_blank\">SWAP website </a></p>\n<p>Most of the listed SWAP courses will include Maths &amp; English study that will meet the GTCS requirement, however it is important to ask the college to make sure.</p>\n<p>Any Access to Higher Education courses, or other programmes please check with admissions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>What HNC’s do you accept?</strong></span></p>\n<p>We accept HNC Childhood Practice and HNC Social Sciences for entry to year one. Applicants will need to achieve a B in the graded unit and meet the minimum level of Maths and English.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>How much of the course is placements?</strong></span></p>\n<p>For Primary teaching there will be 30 weeks placement total across the course, starting in year two. You can view more information on placements on the course page on our website. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Are there interviews?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Not before the primary teaching course starts. In year one students will be assessed/interviewed to allow progression in to year two.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Do I need experience?</strong></span></p>\n<p>While experience is not essential, applicants who can demonstrate within their personal statements that they have experience within primary schools, or other work with young people across a range of age groups, will likely be more competitive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Can I teach in England with this qualification?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Before you can teach in England you will need to apply for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) through the Teaching Regulation Agency. You can apply for QTS and have your qualification assessed via their assessment on <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/MutualRecognition\" target=\"_blank\">mutual recognition</a>. You must firstly however have full registration with the GTCS and completed the probationary period.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Can I teach overseas?</strong></span></p>\n<p>The short answer is yes. However you would need to apply to have your skills/qualifications assessed by the country you intend to go to. Each country has its own form of assessment and eligibility can also depend on whether teaching is on the country’s ‘Skills in Demand list’ if they have one. In most cases you would also need to have a job offer and a relevant visa for that country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>When should I apply?</strong></span></p>\n<p>There is a strict deadline to apply through UCAS by January 25<sup>th</sup> in the same year the course starts. Due to the volume of applications, we are unlikely to be able to consider any applications received after this day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>How many places are available on the course?</strong></span></p>\n<p>There are 120 places on the course.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Can I transfer onto this course from another course at QMU?</strong></span></p>\n<p>No unfortunately this is not an option. This includes those wanting to switch from BA (Hons) Education Studies to BA (Hons) Education Studies (Primary). To be considered for the course you must apply through UCAS and no internal transfers into the course are allowed.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Do I need a criminal record check from the UK to begin the course?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. All applicants with a UK address will need to apply for membership to the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) scheme managed by Disclosure Scotland. If you receive an offer from QMU we will contact you before matriculation to help guide you through this. If you are already a member of the PVG scheme you will need to complete an existing member’s form, and again we will guide you through this process. If you are moving to the UK from overseas you will need to apply for PVG membership once you arrive in the UK and begin your course.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do I need a criminal record check from outside the UK?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have lived in another country for three months or more in a single period since the age of sixteen, you will need to provide a criminal records check from that country. This is in addition to joining the PVG scheme.</p>\n<p>Information on how to obtain a Criminal Record Check from countries outside the UK can be found on the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants\" target=\"_blank\">UK Government website</a> </p>\n<p>If you are/were resident in a country which is not included on the UK Government list, you should obtain a Police Check/Certificate of Good Conduct from the local police authority in the relevant country. </p>\n<p>If the certificate is not in English you will need to provide a certified translation. Submission of these documents by a deadline will form a condition of the offer made to international students.</p>\n<p>All Criminal Record Checks must be dated within the last 1 years prior to the course start date.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do I need to have any vaccinations?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no specific requirement for this. However as you will be entering classrooms with young children it is advisable that your vaccination history is fully up to date. If you are unsure then speak to your GP who can advise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>When will I know my timetable?</strong></p>\n<p>Timetables are made over the summer and you will be able to access your personalised timetable once you matriculate in August.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where will my placement be?</strong></p>\n<p>Your placement can be in any of 5 local authorities. This will be allocated using the placement management system with GTCS and at most you will expected to travel up to 90 minutes to your placement. Students are responsible for the costs associated with travelling to and from placements.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What happens once I graduate?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a legal requirement that all teachers are registered with the GTCS. Upon successful completion of your ITE programme you will be eligible to be provisionally registered with the GTCS. To become fully registered you must complete a probation period equivalent to one school year (190 days). All UK students studying on these programmes will be guaranteed a place on the Teacher Induction Scheme which provides this one-year teaching post in a local authority.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do I have to take part in the Teacher Induction Scheme?</strong></p>\n<p>To become fully registered with the GTCS, all teachers must go through a probationary period and the easiest way to do this is through the Teacher Induction Scheme. If however you are an International student, have opted out of the scheme or cannot commit to a full-time post, you may be able to complete your probation period through the Flexible Route. This allows graduate teachers to build up their experience through temporary or part time employment. If you choose to follow the Flexible Route you will need at least 270 days teaching experience to reach the Standard for Full Registration, rather than the 190 days of the teacher Induction Scheme. For more information on the Flexible Route please contact the GTCS.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Can I do my probation year outwith my local authority?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes you can. If completing your probationary year as part of the Teacher Induction Scheme, you can chose to either work either within your five local authorities or you can chose to work anywhere in Scotland. You will then be assigned a school which can be in any council area of Scotland. By doing this you will earn an extra £6000 (primary) or £8000 (secondary) on top of your probationers salary.</p>\n<p> </p>"
