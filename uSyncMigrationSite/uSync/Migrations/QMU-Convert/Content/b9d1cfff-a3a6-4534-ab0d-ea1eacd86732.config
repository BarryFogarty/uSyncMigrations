      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>Do you want to improve the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of people in low and middle-income settings or of those who have been affected by conflict and displacement? Then this degree may be for you. It focuses on </span>the current challenges and policy debates in global responses in meeting the mental health and psychosocial needs of populations affected by poverty, instability, displacement and conflict.</p>
<p>We examine the political, historical, social, cultural and economic foundations that underlie contemporary conflicts and explore concepts of vulnerability and resilience of individuals and households and their interaction with service providers in conflict and post-conflict settings.</p>
<p>It will also be possible for you to undertake modules that focus on strategies for rebuilding the health system in fragile and post-conflict states and a targeted module focused on refugee integration into host societies.</p>
<p>The MSc will help you to consolidate and extend learning in the area of how to incorporate MHPSS strategies and consideration into other health and humanitarian provision and will equip you to work effectively at senior level to promote mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of people in high, low and middle income settings through effective and responsive programming.</p>

At IGHD we work directly with ministries of health, international and national organisations and local communities to develop real solutions for health and development problems.</li>\n<li>We are on a compassion mission. Our work at IGHD addresses the health and wellbeing of those in greatest need, whether they are vulnerable populations in Scotland or those living in low or middle income countries.</li>\n<li>Our teaching and <u><a href=\"/research-and-knowledge-exchange/research-centres-institutes-and-knowledge-exchange-centres/institute-for-global-health-and-development/\">research expertise</a></u> spans multiple aspects of global health and development.

      "content": "<p>Instead of our broader MSc Global Health, you can choose a more focused pathway at the outset with our MSc Mental Health and Psychosocial Support. We have deliberately designed our courses to be as flexible as possible. This will allow you to apply for the course that best suits your career needs and revise your choice before progressing to the dissertation stage (subject to having studied the appropriate modules.)</p>\n<p>This degree focuses on the current challenges and policy debates in local/ national/global responses to meeting the mental health and psychosocial needs of populations affected by poverty, instability, displacement and conflict. This degree provides health and humanitarian workers with the skills to incorporate Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) strategies and consideration into other health and humanitarian provision.</p>\n<p>Given that the field is somewhat fragmented - with more biomedically and clinically-oriented approaches on one end of the continuum, and more social and wellbeing oriented approaches on the other - the programme will expose students to a range of perspectives. This will be achieved by including diverse course material and teaching perspectives in the core modules, as well as the opportunities for knowledge exchange provided through IGHD’s vast network of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support practitioners and academics.</p>\n<p>The course will equip you to work effectively at senior level to promote mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of people in high, low and middle income settings who have been affected by migration and to incorporate mental health considerations into existing health and social services through effective and responsive programming.</p>"
