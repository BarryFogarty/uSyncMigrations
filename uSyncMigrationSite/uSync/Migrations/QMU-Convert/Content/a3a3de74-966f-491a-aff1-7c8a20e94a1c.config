Normally, the thesis will include three to five publications to which the candidate has made a significant contribution.</p>\n<p>Fewer publications may be required in the case of work which is solely authored. The totality of the thesis must be sufficient to indicate a substantial programme of research equivalent to that undertaken in a traditional PhD.</p>\n<p>The publications must be connected in such a way as to indicate a focussed and sustained investigative process. The candidate should normally be the sole or lead author on the majority of the publications.</p>\n<p><strong>4.6</strong> The probationary panel members will independently assess the probationary proposal and statement and complete a preliminary report.</p>\n<p>The panel will subsequently meet with the candidate and consider the probationary proposal against published criteria.

      "content": "<p><strong>6.1</strong> The key function of the examination is to establish that both the candidate and their submission reach the standard required for the award of PhD, with respect to the criteria listed in 1.1 above. The examination has two stages: the preliminary assessment of the Thesis, followed by its defence at an oral examination.</p>\n<p><strong>6.2</strong> The timeframe for submitting the thesis is as set out in the PhD and MPhil Regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>6.3</strong> Three months prior to submitting the thesis, the candidate and supervisors should apply to the Graduate School Academic Board for approval of the examination team. The procedure for identifying and nominating examiners is as set out in the PhD Regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>6.4</strong> The PhD and MPhil Regulations on composition of exam teams apply. For staff members, there will be two external examiners and one internal examiner.</p>\n<p>For all other candidates there will normally be one external and one internal examiner.</p>\n<p>A neutral, non-examining Independent Chair will also be nominated by the Head of the Graduate School. At least one member of the examination team will normally have experience of examining a PhD by Publication.</p>\n<p>The thesis consists of:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>Copies of the publications.</li>\n<li>A critical appraisal, amounting to between 12,000 and 15,000 words, not including references, providing the rationale and theoretical context for the publications, showing how they form a cohesive whole at doctoral level and represent a contribution to knowledge in the field.</li>\n<li>Statements from co-authors, confirming the candidate’s contribution to each publication.</li>\n<li>An academic Curriculum Vitae.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No publications that were published prior to initial registration on the Programme can be considered for inclusion. Similarly, no publications can be considered for inclusion that have arisen from research previously submitted for examination for another degree.</p>\n<p>Expectations of the rigour, depth and quality of the research and its associated new contribution to knowledge are identical to those expected in other formats.</p>\n<p><strong>6.5</strong> The examiners will assess the thesis and the performance at the oral examination against the criteria set out in 1.1 above. Their judgement will not be made solely on the quality of the publications, but also on their assessment of the candidate’s ability to write and act as an independent researcher. There will be five decisions available to the examiners:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>Pass</li>\n<li>Pass, subject to minor amendments to the critical appraisal, such amendments to be completed within two months</li>\n<li>Resubmit the Thesis within six months, supported by the same publications.</li>\n<li>Resubmit the Thesis with different or additional publications. The examiners should specify the timescale within which the amended portfolio should be submitted, up to a maximum of one full-time year or the equivalent.</li>\n<li>Fail</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>6.6</strong> Candidates may appeal against the decision. The appeals procedure and permissible grounds of appeal are as set out in the PhD and MPhil Regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>6.7</strong> Where minor amendments are specified (option b) above), these should be dealt with in accordance with the PhD and MPhil Regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>6.8</strong> Resubmission shall be allowed where the examiners are satisfied that the candidate broadly meets the criteria relating to an independent researcher but are either dissatisfied with the quality of the thesis or feel that additional publications are required. The examiners must specify whether or not an additional oral examination will be required.</p>\n<p><strong>6.9</strong> A candidate who fails may not reapply until a minimum of three years after the examination.</p>\n<p><strong>6.10</strong> Following award, and prior to graduation, one electronic copy of the thesis must be lodged in the library. Advice on copyright considerations that might affect the inclusion of bound papers should be sought from the Graduate School on a case-by-case basis.</p>"
