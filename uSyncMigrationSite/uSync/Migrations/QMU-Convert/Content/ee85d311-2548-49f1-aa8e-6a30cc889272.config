<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Staff of the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement (GQE) provide support for programme teams preparing for validation and review events. All staff participating in validation and review should contact staff from GQE at an early stage of their preparation.</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The University is responsible to students, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the Scottish Funding Council, employers and the wider community for the quality, standard and relevance of programmes delivered in its name. To fulfil these responsibilities all programmes leading to an award of the University are subject to validation, periodic review and annual monitoring.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><strong>Aim of validation</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The overall aim of the validation process is to establish that the standards and quality of the programme under consideration are consistent with nationally accepted benchmarks and that the programme aligns with the University’s purpose: helping to create a better society through education, research and innovation, and by providing a supportive and creative learning environment in which students and staff thrive</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This is achieved through peer group scrutiny and discussion which is intended to:</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>Challenge and stimulate the programme team by questioning aspects of the proposed programme;</li>
<li>Ensure that the curriculum is properly aligned with external points of reference including the <a href="https://scqf.org.uk" title="Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework">Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework</a>, the <a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/the-quality-code" title="Quality Assurances Agency's UK Quality Code">Quality Assurance Agency’s UK Quality Code</a> and <a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/the-quality-code/subject-benchmark-statements" title="QAA Subject Benchmarks">QAA Subject Benchmarks;</a></li>
<li>Consider alignment with key internal reference points, including the<a href="/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/student-experience-strategy/" title="Student Experience Strategy 2021-26"> University’s Student Experience Strategy (2021-26)</a> and <a href="/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/graduate-attributes/" title="Graduate attributes">Graduate Attributes</a>.</li>
<li>Identify examples of best practice for commendation and dissemination (this is achieved through circulation of the validation or review report, discussion and follow-up action taken by academic committees);</li>
<li>Encourage staff in the development of new areas of the curriculum, new teaching methods and in areas of scholarly activity that will help improve the programme;</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Inform and advise staff of good practice elsewhere and of new developments in the curriculum and teaching methods.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Based on the outcome of the above a decision is made on whether the programme can be recommended for approval.</span></div>

<p>A programme is reviewed after it has been in operation for a period of up to five years (specified at the time of the previous validation or review event). During this time one or more cohorts is likely to have passed through the programme. This means that staff, students and employers will have had experience of its operation. The aim of a programme review is to re-evaluate, through peer group scrutiny and discussion, the health and viability of the programme, the validity of aims and learning outcomes and to ascertain:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the programme has been operated and managed during the most recent period of validation;</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">How standards have been attained and how this has been recognised;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The ways in which the programme has met the needs of the community;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The extent to which all the previously expressed aspirations and ambitions have been </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">fulfilled;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The extent to which the institution has been able to provide an environment in which the </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">programme can flourish.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the outcome of the above a decision is made on whether the programme can continue to be approved.</p>

Exceptionally, as with inter- disciplinary programmes, there may be more than one. However, where there is more than one programme leader it is strongly advised that individual roles and responsibilities for developing and managing the programme be agreed and respected from the outset.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>All (potential) module co-ordinators</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New programme teams should include individuals who are most likely to be named as module co-ordinators. The team may need to recruit individuals as curriculum development dictates.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Review teams should include module co-ordinators with experience of delivering the curriculum, who can contribute detailed critical analysis of the programme and suggestions for revision.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a number of programmes are being put forward for validation together (for instance in the case of School wide validations) it may be appropriate to divide some aspects of planning between sub-groups.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Additional input should be sought for the process of planning from:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Students</strong></p>\n<p>Students should ideally be included on the programme planning team since they offer a different perspective of the programme from that of staff. Where it is not practical to include students, for example in the development of entirely new programmes, one option might be to recruit students from related programmes at QMU. Where possible, review teams should include both current and former students.</p>\n<p><strong>Recent graduates</strong></p>\n<p>If possible, it may be useful to include one or more recent graduates. Graduates are particularly well placed to comment on the way in which the programme has prepared them for employment and can provide useful insights that current students may not be able to offer.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Employers of graduates or employers within the field</strong></p>\n<p>These representatives will bring knowledge of current and future needs of the industry, employability skills of graduates, professional standards and current developments within the profession/industry. Their insight and perspective is crucial to ensure the programme will not only have currency, but will be future-proofed for the term of validation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Placement supervisors and/or practitioners</strong></p>\n<p>Practitioners may contribute professional knowledge and expertise, but will also bring to the discussion their experience of current practice. Placement supervisors will help consider the needs of the profession and issues associated with placements, such as numbers of places, timetabling, student support and staff development.</p>\n<p><strong>Members of QMU advisory boards within the subject</strong></p>\n<p>Some subject areas have professional advisory boards whose role is to contribute to the curriculum portfolio. A member of the board might join the programme team or contribute in other ways, such as critiquing a draft document.</p>\n<p><strong>Members of professional bodies</strong></p>\n<p>Representatives from professional bodies may play an advisory role in curriculum development. It is the responsibility of the programme team to check with the professional body whether this is an expectation in planning for validation or review.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Service users</strong></p>\n<p>Teams are encouraged to involve service users (clients or customers who might access a service provided by graduates from the programme). Service users can comment on the likely benefits of the programme for the wider community. Based on their experiences of the subject (profession) that is under consideration they play an important role in highlighting their expectations of graduates from the programme.</p>\n<p><strong>School representatives</strong></p>\n<p>For inter-disciplinary programmes there should be representatives from the contributing School, which might include module co-ordinators or proposed teaching staff.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Deans of School and Heads of Division</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The programme team is responsible for curriculum development, the preparation of documentation, liaison with GQE and submission of a response to conditions and recommendations.</p>\n<p>Deans of School are responsible for the strategic direction of the School. All new programmes going forward for validation must be included in School Operational Plans.</p>\n<p>The Head of Division is responsible for ensuring that a programme planning team is established and that appropriate staff are assigned to take forward the work of preparation for review or validation. Heads of Division may be involved in the detailed planning process, development and/or delivery of the programme under consideration. However, this is not a requirement.</p>\n<p>Heads of Division are also asked to approve validation and review panels. This is to ensure that there is no conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>It is an expectation that the secretaries to the School Academic Boards will maintain a record of programmes due for review in their respective Schools.

They will be keen to assure themselves that there is a good balance of assessments across the programme and that students have the opportunity to develop specific skills such as reflection and critical thinking in a structured way through the student journey.</p>\n<p>Resource requirements for new programmes are identified and agreed by the Academic Planning Board as described on page 11. It is essential that estimated resource requirements are approved well in advance of the validation by the Dean of School and relevant heads of service departments. The Academic Planning Board will also have considered evidence of demand and the business case for the programme.</p>\n<p>The panel is expected to adopt a peer group approach to provide a constructive and collegiate setting, while at the same time conducting a sufficiently rigorous evaluation of the merits of the programme.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The review panel</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The role of the review panel is similar to that of the validation panel (see above).
