      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Prue, QMU’s chancellor, was pleased to officiate at this special graduation ceremony, which was held at University on the 25<sup>th</sup> November.</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is proud to be the first higher education institution in the east of Scotland to host the Children’s University, which aims to promote exciting and innovative learning activities outside normal school hours to children aged 5 to14. Importantly, it encourages children to become successful and confident learners and contributors.</p>
<p>In a relatively short space of time, the project has grown significantly: over 3000 pupils in East Lothian and Midlothian have participated in QMCU activities.</p>
<p>Prue was a big hit with the young people and their families, many of whom knew her from her recent appearance on the Great British Bake Off, and she clearly enjoyed officiating at the graduation ceremony, which involved 41 pupils from 16 East and Midlothian schools.</p>
<p>Haley Jones, Queen Margaret Children’s University Officer, said: “There was a great buzz about this very special Children’s University graduation ceremony as, for the first time, the young learners received their certificates from Prue Leith and had their individual photos taken with her. The graduation ceremony is always a great way to celebrate the young people’s learning achievements, but Prue’s involvement in this year’s ceremony was truly the icing on the cake!”</p>
<p>Prue Leith said: “Queen Margaret Children’s University is an inspirational initiative which helps inspire and motivate young people to try new activities and rewards them for their efforts. Most of all it’s about having fun, which encourages the children to want to learn and to keep up their learning activities by working through their bronze, silver and gold awards.  As a grandmother and someone who has been involved in training and nurturing young talent, I love the philosophy of the Children’s University and I was delighted to play my part in my first ceremony at QMU.”</p>
<p>Haley concluded: “The young people were pleased to hear about Prue’s learning experiences and we hope her success as a business person, food expert, author and TV personality helps to continue motiving them in their future learning activities.”</p>
