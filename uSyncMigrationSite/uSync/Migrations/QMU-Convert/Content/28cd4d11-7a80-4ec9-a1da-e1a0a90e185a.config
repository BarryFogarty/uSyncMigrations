<p>1.1. Queen Margaret University has a total of 800 single occupancy en-suite rooms located on campus in purpose built student accommodation. Due to high demand, the University does not guarantee students an offer of accommodation; therefore the purpose of this page is to provide a clear set of principles to ensure a fair and transparent process for allocating rooms, to the limit of the supply.</p>
<p>1.2. Places in campus accommodation are normally only available for full-time students requiring accommodation for a full academic year, though a limited number of places are reserved for students studying for one semester. Priority for places is given to care leavers and students with disabilities, regardless of programme or year of study. First year undergraduate students will then be prioritised as set out in section 2.2 below.</p>
<p>1.3. Accommodation is normally provided from September to May/June on a 38-week fixed term lease. Students registered on programmes which start earlier or continue outside of these dates will be given priority for a place during the summer. However, there is no guarantee of accommodation over the summer period and a separate application may need to be submitted.</p>
<p>1.4. The University operates a fair allocation procedure that does not discriminate on grounds of race, colour, religion, ethnicity, sexuality, age, gender or disability. The University accommodation is managed with the values of inclusivity and mutual respect. Students applying to stay on campus should expect to live with people from a diverse range of backgrounds, cultures and experiences.</p>
<p><span class="lead">2. Allocation process</span></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Priority places</strong></p>
<p>2.1.1 Accommodation Services aim to provide a supportive living and study environment and campus accommodation may be particularly suitable for students with additional requirements due to disability, health conditions, status as care leavers or other needs. These students, regardless of programme or year of study, will be given priority for a place in campus accommodation.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Students should discuss their requirements with Accommodation  Services at an early stage before completing the online application. Where appropriate a preliminary visit to view the accommodation can be arranged.<br /><br />2.1.3 Applications must be supported by appropriate evidence such as a medical certificate or doctor’s letter dated no earlier than one month prior to their online application.</p>
<p>2.1.4 Students who indicate on their online application that they have additional requirements and who accept a place in campus accommodation may be required to meet with the Residence Life co-ordinator or other appropriate member of QMU staff so that a personal emergency evacuation plan can be completed within two weeks of their arrival.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 New undergraduate students</strong></p>
<p>2.2.1 First year and direct entry undergraduate students entering Queen Margaret University for the first time and requiring accommodation will be prioritised for a place on campus subject to the following conditions being met:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application for accommodation is submitted no later than 10 June in the year of entry to Queen Margaret University;</li>
<li>They have received and firmly accepted an unconditional/conditional offer of a place on a full-time programme of study no later than 10 June in the year of entry to Queen Margaret University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject to availability, students who meet the above criteria, holding a conditional offer, will receive an offer of accommodation once they have fulfilled the academic conditions of their offer to study at Queen Margaret University.</p>
<p>2.2.2 In the event of the number of places being oversubscribed, international undergraduate students (including those from the EU) will be prioritised first followed by UK undergraduate students with home addresses outside the EH postcode area. Undergraduate students with home addresses inside the EH postcode area will then be allocated on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>2.2.3 Undergraduate students holding an insurance offer from Queen Margaret University are not eligible to apply. Students may apply for accommodation if Queen Margaret University is confirmed as their new firm choice.</p>
<p>2.2.4 Students making a late application for campus accommodation, including students taking up places through clearing, will be placed on a waiting list. Students may be advised to seek alternative accommodation and provided with advice regarding the availability of private accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 New postgraduate students</strong></p>
<p>2.3.1 First year postgraduate students on full-time taught postgraduate programmes are eligible to apply for accommodation.</p>
<p>2.3.2 All such students who apply for accommodation will be prioritised before the start of the session subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application for accommodation is submitted no later than 10 June in the year of entry to Queen Margaret University;</li>
<li>They have received and firmly accepted an unconditional/conditional offer of a place on a programme of study by 10 June in the year of entry to Queen Margaret University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject to availability, students who meet the above criteria, holding a conditional offer, will receive an offer of accommodation once they have fulfilled the academic conditions of their offer to study at QMU.</p>
<p>2.3.3 Accommodation is normally provided from September to June, dependent on the length of the year of study. Those students whose programme continues for a calendar year (12 months) will be given priority for a place during the summer but a change of room and/or  application may be necessary. Accommodation cannot be provided beyond September, even if a programme of study extends beyond this date.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Wherever possible, postgraduate students will be allocated to dedicated accommodation that is reserved for postgraduate and mature students, however, this cannot be guaranteed. The University reserves the right to allocate postgraduate/mature students to any available room if circumstances warrant such an action; however, every endeavour will be made to maintain separation between postgraduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>2.3.5 Students making a late application for campus accommodation will be placed on a waiting list. Students may be advised to seek alternative accommodation and provided with advice regarding the availability of private accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Continuing undergraduate and postgraduate students</strong></p>
<p>2.4.1 A limited number of rooms in campus are made available to eligible continuing students. Applications can be made from April in the preceding academic year. If demand exceeds supply, a ballot will be held for available rooms. To be eligible to apply for accommodation as a continuing student an applicant must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>not</strong> have any outstanding debt, or have had a history of persistent debt, with the University;</li>
<li><strong>not</strong> have been engaged in any serious or persistent misconduct in accordance with the Halls of Residence/Student Code of Conduct. This is including, but not limited to, breaches of the Terms &amp; Conditions of Lease;</li>
<li><strong>have</strong> met the course requirements for the applicable year of study and be a full-time student for the academic year.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.4.2 The University reserves the right to reject an application from any individual who has been found to have contravened the Halls of Residence Code of Conduct, caused damage to University property or distress to other residents during a period of residency.</p>
<p>2.4.3 The University reserves the right, at its absolute discretion, to reject an application from any individual where, upon review, there are reasonable grounds to conclude that they pose a risk to others.</p>
