      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Queen Margaret University is pleased to deliver this Update Report which sets out progress on mainstreaming equality, together with progress under the equality outcomes and in employment statistics. The University’s Mainstreaming Report was first published in April 2013.</p>
<p>Under the requirements of the Public Sector Equality Duty introduced in the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland) Regulations 2012, the University is required to report on how it is mainstreaming equality. The University is also required to report (no later than two years after the initial report) on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>progress made in gathering and using annual employee information to better meet the duty;</li>
<li>progress made towards achieving the equality outcomes published in 2013;</li>
<li>updated gender pay gap information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We consider that there has been significant movement towards mainstreaming equality and diversity throughout the University during the period since the publication of the University’s original report. Equally however, we recognise that we need to continue to work to achieve a number of the outcomes identified in our original report.</p>
<p>Throughout this Report, the University has had due regard to the general duties as specified under the Equality Act 2010 and which require the University to:</p>
<p>1. Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment, and victimisation.<br />2. Advance equality of opportunity by having due regard to removing or minimising disadvantage, meeting the needs of a particular group that are different from the needs of others and by encouraging participation in public life; and<br />3. Foster good relations by tackling prejudice and promoting understanding.</p>
<p>The equality outcomes reflect the protected characteristics of Age, Disability, Faith/belief, Gender identity, Marriage/civil partnership, Pregnancy and maternity, Race, Sex and Sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The University also seeks to remove inequality created by social and economic deprivation in line with Scottish Government objectives and set out in the University’s Outcome Agreement with the <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.sfc.ac.uk/funding/outcome-agreements/outcome-agreements.aspx" target="_blank">Scottish Funding Council (SFC)</a>, published on 22 April 2015. </p>
<p>This Report has been developed through the Equality and Diversity Committee, and has been approved for publication by the Chair of the University Court under powers delegated to the Chair by the University Court at its meeting on 1 April 2015.</p>]]></Value>

      "title": "SECTION 1: Update on Mainstreaming Activity ",
      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\">1 Mainstreaming Equality</span></p>\n<p>Mainstreaming describes the process by which equality and diversity are brought into the core of an institution’s work and integrated into day-to-day activities. It is the process whereby equality and diversity are considered in relation to all functions, including the development of policy and process, training and development, implementation and review. For the University, it means ensuring that equality sits at the heart of its mission, strategy and operational delivery, so as to create a structure and a culture that embraces and advances equality and diversity.</p>\n<p>It was recognised by the Scottish Ministers in their Proposals published in 2013 that “fully mainstreaming equality is a long term improvement journey”. It is a longitudinal process that focuses initially on adapting process and procedure but eventually translates into a way of thinking.</p>\n<p>Queen Margaret University is working to ensure that equality is embedded in the culture and structure of the University so that it better serves its communities. As reported below, the University continues on its improvement journey, having secured some areas of significant progress, but recognising too that there is more to be done.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2 Governance and Strategic Planning</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.1 University Court and Institutional Committees</span></p>\n<p>Mainstreaming has significant implications for the way in which responsibility for equality and diversity is managed. It requires collective responsibility and implementation, coupled with leadership and commitment from the University Court and through the University’s governance and management structures and arrangements.</p>\n<p>Embedding equality and diversity in our governance structures and in our strategic planning process is critical to mainstreaming equality and diversity, as is defining responsibilities setting performance measures and monitoring progress against those measures.</p>\n<p>While responsibility for mainstreaming equality and diversity within the University rests with all staff and students, the University Court is, as a matter of law, responsible for ensuring compliance with the Equality Act 2010 and ensuring that the University meets its public sector equality duty (PSED) and the specific duties relevant to Scotland. The University Court therefore has a role in overseeing the University’s performance of its legal duties and in ensuring that appropriate mechanisms are put in place that provide the necessary assurances from the senior management team that legal requirements are being met.</p>\n<p>The University Court exercises oversight through the University’s Equality and Diversity Committee (EDC). The EDC is responsible to the University Court for the development of the strategic framework for equality in service provision and in employment across the University.</p>\n<p>The Committee is a Standing Committee of the Court, to which it reports at each meeting on its discussions, on the development of specific initiatives, and to which it presents for approval policies and procedures. In so doing, it has a function which reflects the general duties.</p>\n<p>The Committee is chaired by the University Secretary, who is also Secretary to the University Court, and includes in its members a lay member of Court, appointed by the Court. Its wider membership seeks to be reflective of the staff and student body and to benefit from a range of perspectives. To that end, it has members drawn from each academic and professional service area of the University, as well as student and trades union representation.</p>\n<p>The Equality and Diversity Committee has a remit to eliminate discrimination, advance equal opportunities and foster good relations by tackling prejudice and promoting understanding, thereby ensuring the University avoids the potential for discrimination on grounds of the protected equality strands.</p>\n<p>The Committee’s remit goes beyond legislative compliance however. It aims to support delivery of key elements of the University’s Strategic Plan through policy development and the promotion of examples of good ‘equality of opportunity’ practice from both internal and external sources. It also seeks to develop and maintain effective networking and liaison in equality and diversity issues. This applies internally within the University and externally, with a particular focus on working relationships with professional equality professionals and equality bodies such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission and Equality Challenge Unit.</p>\n<p>Along with its responsibility to develop and agree the institutional mission, the University Court has a role in ‘establishing a vision for equality, and in moving the agenda beyond compliance to an approach that ensures the richness and diversity of society are reflected and celebrated within the institution’ .</p>\n<p>We consider that we have made significant progress over the past couple of years in terms of the University Court’s approach to its equality duties evidenced through policy development and through systematic review of the diversity of its membership. Progress in terms of the latter is described fully within pages 11 and 17 of Section 2 below.</p>\n<p>A number of other Committees and structures within the University are concerned with eliminating discrimination, advancing equal opportunities and fostering good relations by tackling prejudice and promoting understanding, These include the Research Strategy Committee, the Student Experience Committee and the Widening Access and Student Retention (WISeR) Board. The manner in which these committees contribute to advancing equality and diversity within the University is discussed further below.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.2 Mission, Vision and Strategic Planning</span></p>\n<p>The University’s refreshed Vision (April 2015) is to be ‘a University of ideas and influence’. The University’s Mission reflects the Vision, with a stated commitment to social justice and to being a community without borders. Underpinning the Mission and the Vision are the Values to which the University aspires, including “recognising equality and diversity in all we do”.</p>\n<p>Equality has been established as a core value that will shape the institutional Strategic Plan from 2015 onwards. Detailed Operational Plans are being developed in support of that strategy. The current objectives under the University’s Strategic Plan 2012-2015 (see objectives 2(vi), 4(iv), 5 and 6(vi) in particular) are unchanged. The Values set out in that plan continue ie ‘social responsibility towards all of the communities we serve, demonstrating respect, care, social justice, equality and fairness.</p>\n<p>An Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) of the new Institutional Strategic Plan will be conducted as part of the University’s approach to mainstreaming.</p>\n<p>Equality and Diversity continue to be a focus of the University’s Outcome Agreement with the Scottish Funding Council.</p>\n<p>The University’s Outcome Agreement 2015-16, published on 22 April 2015, has equality embedded within it, including the aim of removing inequality created by deprivation. The agreement focuses on our commitment to attract and retain students from a wide range of backgrounds, and to support them to achieve successful outcomes.</p>\n<p>We are committed to widening participation amongst students who have previously been inhibited from entering Higher Education for social, economic or cultural reasons but also to taking active steps to maximise their persistence and success. Our widening participation and retention strategy seeks to increase student numbers from non-traditional groups, including those that are: first generation to go to Higher Education; from low progression schools; reside in communities in the lowest 20% and 40% of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (MD20); articulating students from Scotland’s Colleges, disabled students, or those who are Care Leavers.</p>\n<p>Over the period during which we have published an Outcome Agreement, we have adopted a definition of ‘under-represented groups’ that has extended beyond that of the narrow SIMD national indictor and have developed a range of initiatives to increase the participation and retention of those from a broad range of non-traditional groups. This includes disabled students, BME students and male students studying Allied Health programmes. There has been success in a number of areas of recruitment and retention and this is detailed more fully in Section 2 below.</p>\n<p>The outcomes established in the University’s Strategic Plan and its Outcome Agreement are supported by a number of institutional strategies and policies.</p>\n<p>The Student Experience Strategy sets out to ‘maximise the potential of the individual, irrespective of their background’’, to ensure ‘sought-after’ graduates and postgraduates, who are well educated, creative, independent, and reflective citizens, with transferrable skills of flexibility, ready for employment, reflecting a range of academic, multi-disciplinary and transferable skills, as well as an enthusiasm for lifelong learning.</p>\n<p>The strategy places the student at the centre of the educational provision. In support of that aim, we state that programmes will incorporate curricula and learning strategies that ‘recognise diversity in the student body, encourage curiosity, exploration and experimentation and will provide a variety of learning experiences exploring the strengths of active learning and other student centred strategies’.</p>\n<p>We are working to promote entry to and provide education at undergraduate and postgraduate level for all students, whatever their background. We are committed to enhancing the student experience through delivering equality across the protected characteristics and creating an inclusive learning environment; this applies to recruitment and admissions, to the curriculum, teaching and assessment, to welfare and support services, and to staff development and training.</p>\n<p>To date monitoring of the impact of these initiatives has been conducted through the reporting of student progress by age, gender, ethnicity and disability. However, as described in paragraph 2.5 below, we have made significant progress in collecting data on other protected characteristics which provides for improved reporting across all the protected characteristics.</p>\n<p>The Senate, Student Experience Committee and the Equality and Diversity Committee receive reports setting out statistics in relation to students under the categories of gender, ethnicity, age and disability. To date, specific reports have been produced annually which set out statistics by gender, ethnicity and disability in relation to students who have submitted academic appeals, have submitted a complaint under the University’s formal Complaints procedure, or have been subject to action under the University’s Discipline or Fitness to Practise regulations. The total numbers recorded under the latter two procedures are small, and analysis suggests that there are no areas of concern in terms of equality of treatment of students.</p>\n<p>In terms of academic appeals, the most recent report (13/14) records that a higher percentage of men submitted an appeal compared to the overall number of men at the University (2.3% of the male population compared to 0.6% of the female population). The majority of men who submitted appeals were over 24 and identified themselves as white and not disabled. Although a smaller percentage of women submitted appeals as compared to the female population of the University (76% of students at the University identify themselves as female), appeals submitted by women tended to be more successful, particularly those who were in the 21-24 age bracket with no declared disability and identifying as white.</p>\n<p>We have recognised that we need to do better in terms of analysing equivalent information in relation to other protected characteristics, and this is being pursued by the Equality and Diversity Committee. A full suite of Management Information reports on student progress and achievement broken down into each of the protected characteristic groups have been produced and will be reviewed by the Equality and Diversity Committee in May 2015. The full suite of reports is being included in the Annual Reports for each programme for 2014/15. Extracts from the management reports are set out in Section 5 below.</p>\n<p>Further evaluation is conducted at School level through the Annual Monitoring process.</p>\n<p>Annual Monitoring Reports are produced in both Schools each year. This exercise is a crucial element of the University’s quality assurance and enhancement processes, providing an important opportunity for staff to evaluate the programmes for which they are responsible, and for the School Academic Board to exercise its responsibility for assuring academic standards and enhancing the quality of the student experience.</p>\n<p>The template for production of the annual programme report includes a specific section, headed ‘Equality and Diversity’ which invites academic programme leaders to highlight ‘matters identified relating to the enhancement of equality and diversity and action taken or planned, whether in relation to recruitment, student support, curriculum content, or methods of learning, teaching and assessment’. Any matters identified at programme level are then reported through the composite School report, the template for which has a discrete section that invites the Dean to comment as set out above.</p>\n<p>Some of the matters highlighted most recently are provided below as illustrative of the issues that are discussed and reported.</p>\n<p>From the Annual Monitoring Report from the School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management from 2013-14, cognisance was taken of the higher number of students with learning disabilities in particular programmes. Smaller teaching groups have been facilitated to ensure that these students are not disadvantaged.</p>\n<p>From the Annual Monitoring Report from the School of Health Sciences from 2013-14, attempts to increase the numbers of male students on health science programmes was reported. It is reported also that there is a positive trend in terms of recruitment of students from non-traditional backgrounds. Policy in relation to students on placement when there may be religious or faith considerations is being developed.</p>\n<p>The Student Experience Strategy also commits us to enhancing the student experience by recruiting, developing and retaining excellent staff who reflect the diversity of the student population. The policy and practice of the institution requires that all staff are afforded equal opportunities within employment, and that entry into employment with the institution and the progression within employment will be determined only by personal merit and the application of criteria which are related to the duties of each particular post and the relevant salary structure. In all cases, the ability to perform the job effectively, safely and fairly is a primary consideration. We are committed to ensuring that our staff population is representative of the wider community. Monitoring of that is conducted through profiling of staffing. Evidence in support of that is presented in the Appendices to this report.</p>\n<p>Our strong commitment to equality in research is promoted in a number of different ways, including through the HR Excellence Award for Researcher Career Development and further Athena SWAN recognition. Further details are set out under Section 2 below.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.3 Single Equality Scheme</span></p>\n<p>In order to mainstream equality, the University previously produced a Single Equality Scheme with an associated action plan. This Scheme was used as an aid to further mainstreaming of equality into the culture and thinking of the University.</p>\n<p>The Single Equality Scheme recognises that the responsibility for successfully realising our mission is a shared responsibility that can only be achieved by the support of everyone within the university. Through the scheme, the University has committed to encouraging all staff, students and visitors to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>treat other individuals with respect at all times</li>\n<li>where they occur, challenge discriminatory behaviour, attitudes or practices</li>\n<li>participate in a variety of training and development opportunities that will enable reflect upon their own potential prejudices and apply good practice</li>\n<li>operate a fair, open and transparent procedure for the recruitment of staff and students</li>\n<li>provide fair and accessible opportunities for staff development and promotion</li>\n<li>operate fair and transparent procedures for student progression, assessment, attainment of awards as well as student involvement in other University activities</li>\n<li>promote the use of inclusive language and avoid the use of discriminatory or exclusive words or phrases in University publications and correspondence</li>\n<li>introduce new and update existing policies and procedures which support the University’s commitment to equality and diversity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are actively reviewing the Scheme through the Equality and Diversity Committee, with the intention to codify our commitments in a refreshed and re-launched Equality Policy. It is recognised that the University has used the Equality Outcomes to lead on mainstreaming over the last two years. This is not a negative approach as outcomes can enhance mainstreaming and vice versa, although there can be a lack of consistency across the University as some groups are more engaged than others. We believe that the governance and strategic planning approach highlighted above should improve the University’s approach and create a definitive method of measuring success.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.4 Equality Impact Assessment</span></p>\n<p>As part of its mainstreaming approach, the University undertakes Equality Impact Assessments (“EIAs”) when reviewing and developing strategy, policy and process. A key indicator of Chapter B4 of the QAA’s Quality Code states that “a commitment to equity guides higher education providers in enabling student development and achievement”. This allows providers to take into account fairness, inclusion and accessibility. The Code highlights the importance of effective equality impact assessment.</p>\n<p>While this is a useful tool, we recognise that not all staff are involved in the EIA exercise. The equality policy and the template for equality impact assessment are in the process of being reviewed and will be re-launched for academic session 2015-16.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.5 Management Information</span></p>\n<p>We have put in place improved management information capability that provides us with the basis to monitor and evaluate our performance across a wide range of indicators. Additional reports and evaluation mechanisms have been developed which ensure we are able to monitor progress of students and assess the impact of initiatives. We recognise though that the usefulness of such management information is reliant on our capacity to collect and to produce resulting meaningful data. This is an area that has been under significant development over the past 2 years as part of our Business Intelligence project (student statistics) and through development of our HR ITrent system.</p>\n<p>Statistics on our student population are set out in Section 5 below. We are making progress in a number of areas.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we have improved our capacity to collect information as suggested by the reduction in the percentage of ‘unknowns’. This applies across each of the protected characteristics groups as follows:</p>\n<p>Comparative data -2014/15 and 2012/13<br />Gender: no ‘unknowns’ or refusals 2014/15.</p>\n<p>Ethnicity: 3.3% not known 2014/15/ compared with 1.5% 2012/13, but 0% refusal compared with 2.3% refusal 2012/13.</p>\n<p>Religion: 32.5% not known 2014/15 compared with 53.5% 2012/13</p>\n<p>Sexual Orientation: Comparative refusal rates of 2-3%, 36.4% not known 2014/15 compared with 58.1% not known 2012/13</p>\n<p>Sexual Identity: 30% not known 2014/15 compared with 52.5% not known 2012/13; refusal rates comparative 0.7/0.5%</p>\n<p>We will continue to work to improve the %age of ‘not known’ but we consider that the information available to us does allow us to produce management reports that are significant in statistical terms.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we have improved our capacity to produce live ‘on time’ reports that are accessible to all staff, either through direct access to the reports, or by request. In the area of retention and progression, for example, we are moving to provide reports on a monthly basis to all programme leaders and senior academic managers so that any issues emerging are identified. As stated on page 7 above, we have recognised that we need to do better in terms of analysing information in relation to all protected characteristics. A full suite of Management Information reports on student progress and achievement broken down into each of the protected characteristic groups have been produced and will be reviewed by the Equality and Diversity Committee in May 2015. The full suite of reports is being included in the Annual Reports for each programme for 2014/15.</p>\n<p>Management information and supporting commentary on our staff is set out in Appendices 1 and 2 of this report.</p>"

      "title": "SECTION 2: Equality Outcomes: Reporting on Progress",
      "content": "<p>As part of the mainstreaming process and to comply with the specific duties, the University is required to publish, undertake and report on progress on equality outcomes. Equality outcomes are not targets or processes. An outcome is an aspirational end result which, in the short term, will change awareness, knowledge, skills and attitudes, and in the longer term, will change behaviour, put a focus on equality in decision making and improve social and environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>Not all outcomes have been attained and not all outcomes will be achievable in isolation - some require partnership working. Some outcomes may not be achievable at all due to larger societal influence, but it is still important nevertheless to recognise those that fall into that category. Each outcome identifies which protected characteristic groups will benefit from the outcome. Where a protected characteristic is not covered by any outcomes, the University details why the group has not been covered in this Report.</p>\n<p>Equality outcomes should aspire to be SMART (specific, measureable, attainable, relevant and time bound) in order that progress can be determined. This has been attempted, but as previously acknowledged, some outcomes will be the result of influences outwith the University’s direct control. All outcomes are evidenced based (a list of evidence sources can be reviewed in Section 4). Some outcomes have been chosen for their partnership working possibilities to ensure a clear message on equality is communicated by multiple agencies across the local area.</p>\n<p>As set out in the paragraphs that follow, we consider that we have made significant progress over the past couple of years in a number of areas. At this stage of the report, we would highlight progress particularly in the areas of:</p>\n<p>• Governance (Outcome 3)<br />• Student admission and retention (Outcomes 1 and 2).<br />• Research Careers (Outcomes 11 and 12).</p>\n<p>Governance</p>\n<p>The University Court’s approach to its equality duties is evidenced through policy development and through systematic review of the diversity of its membership.</p>\n<p>Recruitment for independent or lay members during 2013 and 2014 sought to address directly the diversity of membership in line with the commitment set out in our Mainstreaming Report and Outcomes that ‘all committees and decision making bodies of the University are representative of its community’. A diversity audit of current membership was conducted by the Nominations Committee so that recruitment took account fully of the balance of skills, attributes and experience of the current lay membership.</p>\n<p>With advice from the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU), we have particularly sought expressions of interest from women, disabled people, ethnic minorities and applicants who would further enhance the diversity of the Court. Advertisements for vacancies were placed in a range of media, including, Women on Boards, with the intention of encouraging more female applicants. Again with the advice of the ECU, the person specification was revised so as to accommodate those without previous board level experience, but who were able to demonstrate a track record of success in professional areas of expertise.</p>\n<p>Most recently, at its meeting in December 2014, the University Court approved goals and policies in regard to the balance of its independent members in terms of equality and diversity as follows:</p>\n<p>‘Queen Margaret University is committed to ensuring that the University Court (Court), Senate and all committees and decision making bodies of the University are representative of its community. In particular, the University will seek opportunities to address gender balance and to strengthen the representation and voice, amongst its lay membership, of all groups represented by Court.</p>\n<p>To this end, the University is committed to achieving the following goals and targets:</p>\n<p>- The University will work towards achieving practical gender balance amongst lay members of Court. Practical gender balance will be achieved where the lay membership of Court constitutes not less than 40% of either gender.</p>\n<p>- The University will undertake an annual review of the equality and diversity characteristics of the Court or as a specific need for review is identified.</p>\n<p>- In undertaking any recruitment activity concerning the appointment of lay members of Court, the Court will have regard to equality and diversity characteristics of the Court and will take positive actions to increase the likelihood of applications being submitted from applicants that would enhance the representative character of the Court.</p>\n<p>- The University will harness appropriate opportunities to further promote and improve gender balance and the representation and enhance the representative character of the Court, Senate and other committees and decision-making bodies within the University including but not limited to making training on equality and diversity available to members of the Court.</p>\n<p>We have also moved to collecting equality data in relation to Court members in support of our commitment to ensuring that there is an appropriate balance of independent members on the University Court in terms of equality and diversity. The data will provide the Court with the information it needs to ensure that its equality and diversity goals are being met by identifying where gaps in representation arise, allowing the Court to target recruitment activity to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved.</p>\n<p>Student Recruitment and Retention</p>\n<p>In terms of our student population, we continue to focus on ensuring that potential students from under-represented groups are fully informed about courses, admissions procedures and the student experience in order for them to make informed choices. Post-entry, they are able to access a range of services such as QM Advance, QM Assist (Articulation Student Support), Direct Entrant Induction Week, QM Connect (mentoring), as well as study skills and student finance support.</p>\n<p>We have a strong working relationship with our Students’ Union and work jointly with the Union on a number of projects to promote student engagement and persistence, including the Student Mental Health and Campus Life projects. An important element of our strategy has been to enhance the ‘persistence’ of identified groups by increasing their engagement with their studies through a range of funded initiatives, including a team of Student Engagement Assistants led by the Students’ Union who have engaged with students through a series of ‘Life skills’ workshops and drop-ins and an Employer Mentoring Programme.</p>\n<p>Our retention activities are evaluated and evolve and develop on the basis of our internal research evidence of ‘what works’. We continue to work also with colleagues in the sector on understanding reasons for student withdrawal, and in assisting such students to re-engage in study at a later point.</p>\n<p>The University continues to work to actively recruit students from the protected characteristic groups, including BME, disabled students and mature students.</p>\n<p>In terms of benchmarking our performance, we have noted that, according to the 2011 Census, four per cent of people in Scotland recorded were from minority ethnic groups – an increase of two percentage points since 2001. Statistics based on our annual statistical return to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), confirm that we have increased the percentage of Scottish domiciled BME students studying at the University from 5.7% to 7.3%.</p>\n<p>Over a three year rolling period to 2017, we have committed to working to ensure that we continue to recruit and retain students with declared disabilities. Our disabled student population is consistently maintained at a level some 2% above the rest of the Scottish University sector and some 3% above our HESA benchmark. Statistics on progress to date are set out below.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 231px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 84px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 84px;\">Scottish domiciled, UG students only</th>\n<th style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 84px;\">Actual 11/12</th>\n<th style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 84px;\">Actual 12/13</th>\n<th style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 84px;\">Target<br />2013/14</th>\n<th style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 84px;\">Actual<br />2013/14</th>\n<th style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 84px;\">Three year rolling figure</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 42px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">Disabled students</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">15.4%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">14.8%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">9.6%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">14.3%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">14.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 63px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 63px;\">Students from BME background</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 63px;\">5.7%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 63px;\">6.3%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 63px;\">6.0%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 63px;\">7.3%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 63px;\">6.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 42px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">Mature students</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">29.2%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">27.0%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">32%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">26.2%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6667%; height: 42px;\">27.4%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In our latest evaluation to the Scottish Funding Council, we have reported the following in terms of student retention for 2013/14 ie an overall retention rate for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scottish-domiciled undergraduate students of 93.6% (up from 93.3% in the previous year).</li>\n<li>SIMD20 students of 92.9% against a target of 91.7%.</li>\n<li>Male students of 90.6% against a target of 90%</li>\n<li>Disabled students of 92.8% against a target of 87%.</li>\n<li>SHEP students of 94%, and for SHEP +LEAPS students, 93%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our retention activities are evaluated and evolve and develop on the basis of our internal research evidence of ‘what works’. We continue to work also with colleagues in the sector on understanding reasons for student withdrawal, and in assisting such students to re-engage in study at a later point.</p>\n<p>Updates on specific initiatives are set out in the updates to Outcomes 1 and 2 below.</p>\n<p>Research Careers</p>\n<p>In terms of research, the University received very positive feedback on the staff profile of its REF submission and the wide integration of staff with complex and special circumstances. The number of staff eligible for submission in these categories was significantly above sector averages. QMU has committed to act on the feedback and comments from the HEFCE Equality and Diversity Panel.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, the University received confirmation that it was one of the first of ten UK institutions to retain the HR Excellence Award for Researcher Careers. Among the criteria for the award, and its retention, is the ability to demonstrate that rewards and other terms and conditions of service for contract research staff (for example, rates of pay, provisions for leave and sick leave, pensions, access to facilities) are in line with those for established<br />staff. There needs to be assurance also of equal opportunities and the elimination of practices linked to the short-term nature of contracts which indirectly discriminate against women. Full details of the way in which equality of opportunity is being addressed in research careers is set out in the update on Outcomes 11 and 12 below.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 1: INCREASE THE RETENTION OF MALES IN HEALTH SCIENCES <br />OUTCOME 2: INCREASE THE RETENTION OF MALES IN PERFORMING ARTS</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Student Retention and Surveys Manager</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target recruitment to males.</li>\n<li>Work with Edinburgh Council, East Lothian Council and Midlothian Council to adapt attitude to caring professions in younger generations.</li>\n<li>Target recruitment to males.</li>\n<li>Work with Edinburgh Council, East Lothian Council and Midlothian Council to improve attitude to arts professions in younger generations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For ease of reference, progress on these two Outcomes have been brought together and set out in the table below.</p>\n<p>In AY2011/12, male students represented 20.3% of the total number of full-time undergraduate Scottish-domiciled QMU students. This increased to 23.3% in AY2012/13 and then further increased to 24.4% in AY2013/14.</p>\n<p>Data shows that retention of male students increased between 2010/11 and 2013/14 from 90.9% to 91.4%. Retention of all male students in Health Sciences has increased from 91.6% to 93%. Retention of all male students in Performing Arts dipped from 98% to 94%. This compares favourably against all male students but is lower that all students in Performing Arts (97.2%).</p>\n<p>Table 1 sets out statistics for Scottish domiciled male students at QMU.</p>\n<p>For Outcomes 1, 2, 4 and 5, it should be noted that all data is taken from the Student Retention Research Update for Academic Year 2013/2014. The withdrawal data is for full-time undergraduate Scottish-domiciled students at QMU for the last three academic years (11/12, 12/13, 13/14). The full report, including all groups of students and not only restricted to Scottish-domiciled students, was considered at the WISeR Board (formerly the Student Retention Project Board) on 29 October 2014.</p>\n<p>TABLE 1</p>\n<p>A number of activities over the last couple of years have sought to improve retention of male students.</p>\n<p>Under the auspices of the Student Retention Project Board, a project team was set up with staff from the Student Retention Project, Student Services and the Students’ Union. The team held informal discussion with a focus group of male students about their experience at the University and their perceptions of support and why male students leave. The research suggested reluctance on the part of male students to seek necessary support at key stages of their university career. That suggested that there needed to more focus of providing clear signposting of the range of support available to students who were thinking of withdrawing from their studies. The project engaged a group of media students and asked them to consider how the University could best provide support to students, particularly focussing on male students. The group provided helpful feedback on a student support booklet and also offered advice on tone of voice and language used on the ‘thinking of leaving’ website.</p>\n<p>There is recognition also of the importance of having appropriate sources of advice for male students. The Students’ Union offers Scottish Mental Health First Aid training to students each year. In 2013/14 there was a particular focus on promoting the training opportunity to male students directly through sports and societies, many of which are male led/dominated.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to establish a causal link between these projects and increased male retention, as the University has invested significantly in projects to improve its retention rates overall (which will have benefitted male and female students).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, male retention in Health has improved to the point where this is no longer an area identified for action under the University’s mainstreaming report. As noted above, retention of all male students in Health Sciences has increased to 93%, while retention of Scottish domiciled male students within Health Sciences increased to 91.7%.</p>\n<p>It is intended that this outcome is revised to state the intention of increasing the representation of male students in Health Sciences. This would bring the outcome in line with the University’s Outcome Agreement 2015/16 and will be progressed through a number of University initiatives to widen access to the University, including the South East of Scotland Academies Project and the Children’s University. Responsibility has been assigned to the Widening Access and Student Retention (WISeR) Board in the first instance. This revision is incorporated in the updated Outcomes set out on page 39 below.</p>\n<p>Retention of Scottish domiciled males in Drama and Performance increased between 11/12 and 12/13, then decreased in 2013/14, but nevertheless remains higher than the QMU average, and 5% above male retention in the School of ASSaM. Retention of all male students in Performing Arts dipped sits currently at 94%. As retention of males in performing arts has been consistently good and above QMU average, it is intended that this Outcome is removed.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 3: ENSURE THAT THE WORKFORCE OF THE UNIVERSITY REPRESENTS</p>\n<p>THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Head of Human Resources and University Secretary</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promote equality and diversity in selection of staff and in consideration of job descriptions;</li>\n<li>Review arrangements for encouraging people with protected characteristics to apply for positions;</li>\n<li>Ensure all committees and decision making bodies of the University are representative of its community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The University is committed to embedding transparent and fair practices in the recruitment and selection of its staff. The equalities impact of all HR policies, including those related to the recruitment and selection of staff are subject to equality impact assessment. The University’s Recruitment and Selection Policy states that any applicant declaring a disability who meets the minimum criteria for the position, as described in the job description, will be invited to interview.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure fair treatment, the University has adopted a competency based approach to interviews. All those participating in appointment panels are offered training and HR support in order to enrich their understanding and ensure consistent application of the competency based approach. The competency based approach supports the objective assessment of competencies linked to the job description, reducing the potential for bias in selection decisions.</p>\n<p>In addition to face to face training and HR support, the University has launched a range of e-learning modules from February 2015, including one on unconscious bias. These modules are available to all staff and being actively promoted to raise awareness. Arrangements have also been put in place in support of the University Court’s commitment to ensure that each of its members undertake e-learning modules on Equality and Diversity.</p>\n<p>As reported earlier within pages 12-14, the University has recently benchmarked its governance arrangements against the Scottish Code of Good Higher Education Governance (published July 2013) and has made particular progress against the third activity suggested above in relation particularly to membership of its governing body, the University Court. The policy statement, developed by the Nominations Committee of Court, and approved by the University Court at its December 2014 meeting is set out in full on page 13 above.</p>\n<p>The policy statement has codified the practice of the Court over the last couple of years, where active steps have been taken to evaluate and promote the diversity of its membership. At the time of reporting (April 2015), female members of the University Court account for 39% of total membership, and female members of the University Senate account for 44%. The impact of codifying the University’s goals in this area will be monitored and reported on in April 2017, particularly in relation to the other protected characteristics.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 4: INCREASE RETENTION OF MATURE STUDENTS</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Student Retention and Surveys Manager</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target mature students as part of the Student Retention Project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Table 2 below reports on progress in retaining mature students.</p>\n<p>In AY2011/12, mature students represented 27.5% of the total number of full-time undergraduate Scottish-domiciled QMU students. This decreased to 25.5% in AY2012/13 and then decreased further to 24.6% in AY2013/14.</p>\n<p>Retention of all undergraduate mature students has remained stable between 2010/11 and 2012/14 (94.1% and 93.8% respectively). Retention of Scottish domiciled mature entrants has also remained largely stable between 11/12 and 2013/14.</p>\n<p>TABLE 2</p>\n<p>It is recognised that mature students often face difficulties in studying, for example where they have additional financial or caring responsibilities. Staff in all areas of the University can and do provide assistance to mature students to allow them to remain on their programme.<br />Mature students access a range of transition events such as the QMAdvance induction programme and the Direct Entrants’ Induction week. Once at University, mature students benefit from mentoring and the Employer Mentoring programme. Feedback from mature entrants and students suggests that these initiatives have a positive impact in terms of increased confidence.</p>\n<p>One mature student studying a health care subject stated that the monies received from student hardship funds meant that she could continue studying, particularly when injury prevented her from continuing her part time job. Support from staff at that time was highlighted as “overwhelming” and made the student feel valued on the course.</p>\n<p>Two other students added that the online access was invaluable to them as parents as it meant they could study in their own time. It was also noted that the University was “baby-friendly” though further promotion of assistance with childcare costs during placement was highlighted as an area of improvement.</p>\n<p>The Widening Access and Student Retention Board (WiSER) is developing an updated action plan in support of the Widening Access and Retention Strategy 2015/16 which will seek to address retention of groups identified as being less likely to persist in their studies.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 5: INCREASE THE RETENTION AND REPRESENTATION OF BME STUDENTS</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Student Retention and Surveys Manager, Head of Admissions</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target BME students as part of the Student Retention Project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Table 3 below provides update on progress in terms of retention.</p>\n<p>TABLE 3</p>\n<p>In AY2011/12, BME students represented 5.9% of the total number of full-time undergraduate Scottish-domiciled QMU students. This increased to 6.4% in AY2012/13 and then increased further to 7.1% in AY2013/14.</p>\n<p>BME students increased as a percentage of all students from 8.7% to 9.6% between 2010/11 and 2013/14.</p>\n<p>Retention of all BME students increased between 2011/12 and 2012/13 (92.3% to 93.4%), then decreased in 2012/13 to 90% before improving in 2013/14 to 90.5%.</p>\n<p>The Widening Access and Student Retention Board (WiSER) is developing an updated action plan in support of the Widening Access and Retention Strategy 2015/16 which will seek to address retention of groups identified as being less likely to persist in their studies.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 6: DEVELOP FLEXIBLE AND REVISED POLICIES TO INCREASE FLEXIBLE WORKING CAPABILITIES AND CHILDCARE OR OTHER CARING ARRANGEMENTS.</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Head of Human Resources</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<p>• Raise awareness of HR policies amongst all staff<br />• Continue to consult with key stakeholders over the revision of existing and the development of new policies and on the potential qualities impacts<br />• Continue to develop and revise HR policies based on best practice and legislative changes taking into account all of the protected characteristics</p>\n<p>All HR polices are subject to review on an annual basis or as legislation changes, are subject to an equality impact assessment and a rigorous consultation process with the University’s trade unions. Awareness of HR policies is raised through QMU @ Work and through corporate and HR induction.</p>\n<p>The University has developed policies for Special Leave arrangements which offer a degree of work flexibility for those staff with caring responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The University’s considers flexible working requests from all staff and in many cases managers work with staff members to find working patterns and arrangements that suit both the individual’s and the University’s requirements. The University accommodates a high volume of flexible working requests, both formal and informal to facilitate employees in managing their caring responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The Head of Human Resources has suggested that this Outcome would be more effective if it was revised to read as follows:-</p>\n<p>Revised Outcome 6: Ensure that our HR policies promote inclusive employment opportunities and provide clear advice to all staff on opportunities to work flexibly</p>\n<p>The impact of the revised outcome will be kept under review by, for example, uptake of the policies and possible future staff surveys and be reported on in the next reporting period.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 7: ENSURE THAT DISABLED STAFF AND STUDENTS’ NEEDS ARE FULLY ACCOMMODATED</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Head of Student Services, Head of Human Resources and Director of Campus Services</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop improved processes for staff to access support;</li>\n<li>Develop and publicise information on the support available for staff;</li>\n<li>Work with external bodies to develop a staff culture which promotes good health;</li>\n<li>Develop further awareness of issues relating to students with specific learning difficulties or disabilities;</li>\n<li>Embed a culture of improved and necessary support for mental health issues;</li>\n<li>Continue to work towards an inclusive environment for disabled students;</li>\n<li>Reduce the overall number of specific adjustments recommended in favour of a mainstreamed approach;</li>\n<li>Encourage early disclosure;</li>\n<li>Ensure the campus facilities and surrounding transport arrangements are fit for purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Statistics relating to the number of Disabled students at the University are set out in Section 5 below. We expect fully that the numbers and %ages noted for 2014/15 will increase, as a number of students come forward for assessment throughout the academic year.</p>\n<p>The Disabled Students’ Allowance is available to eligible students to support them in their learning, so that they are not disadvantaged in relation to their non-disabled peers due to the impact of their disability. Funding can support the purchase of equipment, non-medical personal help and various consumables.</p>\n<p>Table 4 below indicates the total number of QMU applicants for DSA support in 2013/14 and also allows a comparison to be made over a full five-year period.</p>\n<p>TABLE 4</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total number of DSA applications in 2013/2014 was 273 which represented a 5% increase on the previous year, and the highest number in any one year.</li>\n<li>There has been a 22% increase in the total number of DSA applicants over the five years since 2009/10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the 273 applications made in 2013/14, a further 23 students were DSA eligible, but did not apply. A number of students at QMU are eligible for support but are not eligible to apply for DSA. These include International students, most EU students and students who are undertaking too few credits to meet eligibility criteria. Support costs for these students are met by QMU using two separate funds: Disability Service Premium and the QMU Student Fund. Funding supported Educational Psychologist Assessments, non-medical personal help for two students whose support costs exceeded their DSA allocation and examination support.</p>\n<p>Following successful revalidation in 2012/13, QMU continued to provide DSA Needs Assessments for students through the QMU Needs Assessment Centre (QMUNAC). The range of students for whom assessments were provided included those with Specific Learning Difficulties, with Mental Health Difficulties and with Autistic Spectrum Conditions <br />It has been anticipated that QMU would be required to submit a QMUNAC revalidation application to the Disabled Students Advisory Group in April 2014, however, due to external changes within the FE sector in Scotland and multiple revalidation applications from newly merged colleges, the revalidation deadline for QMUNAC was moved to October 2014 and will be undertaken in AY 2014/15.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, questionnaires were sent out to all students who had had a needs assessment at QMUNAC over the academic year 2013/14 and were returning to QMU for AY 2014/15, to which there was a 47% return rate (35/74). The survey was in the form of a questionnaire in which statements were phrased such that agreement indicated satisfaction with the DSA provision and disagreement indicated dissatisfaction. Four key themes were covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The student’s experience of the actual assessment interview</li>\n<li>The content of the report</li>\n<li>The outcomes of the DSA award as recommended in the report</li>\n<li>The overall DSA process at QMU</li>\n</ul>\n<p>High satisfaction levels emerged across all 4 themes (strongly agree/agree responses):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"lead\">Process – 86%</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"lead\">Assessment experience – 98%</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"lead\">Report – 94%</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"lead\">Value of outcomes – 92%</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taken in combination, 709 out of 809 responses were positive (Strongly agree/Agree) indicating a satisfaction level of 87.6 %. Overall, results indicated growing satisfaction with the Report: 94% up from 90% in the previous year, the Value of DSA outcomes: 92% up from 89% in the previous year. The Assessment experience retained a high satisfaction level of 98%. The single area where satisfaction levels were somewhat reduced was in the Process, 86%, down from 89% in the previous year, yet still indicating a positive result.</p>\n<p>There have been a number of positive developments under this Outcome.</p>\n<p>The Mental Health Working Group, with the support of the Equality and Diversity Committee, has organised two successful mental health awareness days. The impact of these days is measurable in terms of the confidence of staff and students to discuss mental health, the increased awareness of issues, the use of the mindapple model in teaching and the momentum to have further events, including a University mental health and wellbeing day in February 2015. Links have been established with local community groups and initiatives.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to measure success in this area, but the uptake of the bibliotherapy information provided to staff and students suggests that there is an appetite for these events to continue to increase awareness of difficulties that can be experienced across the protected characteristics and in relation to disability in particular.</p>\n<p>It is recognised that students with learning or other disabilities can find it difficult to integrate into the University setting. The Students’ Union, with support from the WiSER project fund, has established a Student Engagement Assistant service to assist all students but the service can be of particular benefit to those with disability. The Assistants provide advice and help to all students which can be seen as more accessible as the Assistants are also students. A positive example of how this system works well was the case of a new student who came to the drop-in sessions. It was identified that he was at risk of leaving as he was living off campus (at significant distance) and was struggling with his university work. The service was able to assist in finding him accommodation on campus and advice and support on how to use the library. The student was also accompanied to meetings in order that he felt reassured to express all he was thinking. The student is now progressing well.</p>\n<p>Other notable activities include a high profile Dyslexia Awareness Week, which included a public talk from Sir Jackie Stewart on his experiences of living with dyslexia. There are further activities planned in a similar vein for both staff and students.</p>\n<p>Within the reporting period, the University has revamped and relaunched its Disability Policy relating to both staff and students and clarified processes around Individual Learning Plans to ensure that students with disabilities, learning or otherwise, are not disadvantaged during assessment by unclear procedure.</p>\n<p>University staff can access support in matters relating to disability from Human Resources partner staff, or through the University’s Health and Safety Adviser. All staff are encouraged to complete a work station assessment through the University’s online tool, Workrite, the results of which are followed up on a 121 basis by the Health and Safety Adviser. These arrangements are promoted through QMU @ Work, Health and Safety and HR induction.</p>\n<p>The University accommodates many adjustments for staff on the basis of disability both in relation to workstations and working arrangements such as adjustments to working hours, start and finish times etc. By their nature, many of the adjustments made are specific to the individual staff member, but consideration is given as to whether the adjustment could be implemented for all staff.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 8: ENSURE STUDENTS MEET EMPLOYERS’ REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Deans of Schools and Head of Student Services</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure students are aware of the general duty and embed a culture of fostering good relations;</li>\n<li>Work with external agencies to ensure that students and employers are aware of each other’s obligations and the expected requirements of junior staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Outcome has been approached through the University’s Employability strategy. The strategy has the aim, amongst others, of consolidating and improving engagement with employers of all sizes, locally, nationally and internationally, utilising and sharing existing relationships whilst developing new relationships. This strategy should foster good relations between all the protected characteristics as it will assist the University and employers to understand each other’s needs, as well as influencing the development of graduate attributes in all QMU students. These attributes apply regardless of any of the protected characteristics. The impact of the strategy will be monitored and reported on in future reports as it is too early to determine impact at this stage.</p>\n<p>The Employability Service monitors the gender breakdown of users, and in the last semester (semester one 2014-15) the majority of users (2:1 ratio) were, or presented as, female. This is interesting as the percentage of males (presenting as male or declared) was higher than the percentage of men who attend the University. The service also monitored the number of non-UK domiciled students who accessed the service and 37% of users were in this category. These results will be benchmarked against future results to look for trends and to determine if work needs to be done to ensure that no particular protected characteristics grouping is being disadvantaged by not accessing the service or not being able to access the service.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 9: INCREASE AWARENESS OF HATE CRIME AND DECREASE TOLERANCE OF THIS CRIME</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Convener of the Equality and Diversity Committee</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promote good relations between groups of different protected characteristics by the introduction of an Equality and Diversity week and working with external agencies;</li>\n<li>Introduce a staff LBGT network;</li>\n<li>Develop and implement a trans persons policy;</li>\n<li>Work with external agencies to develop understanding of the ways to report hate crime</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Outcome has been progressed in two ways.</p>\n<p>An LGBT+ Society has been re-established as a result of an initiative by the students and the Students’ Union. The Society will represent all sexualities and gender identities within the University. The “+” symbol is to represent all gender identities and sexualities outwith the “LGBT” label. The Society is looking to raise awareness and focus on student well-being. There will be challenges around this, and the University aims to be as supportive as possible. Communications should be improved with this Society.</p>\n<p>As part of its recognition of LGBT members of staff, the EDC is working with Stonewall, a member of which is being invited to participate in a future committee meeting.</p>\n<p>The University has also been participating in the re-invention of a rights network across the Lothian region. This has involved the Secretary to the EDC attending meetings with partners and stakeholders where a new Charter for the network has been created and a tender for services of the network facilitator established. The funding for this network is primarily from Council budgets as well as contributions from Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue and local NHS Boards. The Equality and Rights Network should be in place by May 2015.</p>\n<p>The next report will assess the impact this Network has had in relation to the University’s obligations under these outcomes and how the Network has influenced practice.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 10: ENSURE STUDENTS WITH CARING RESPONSIBILITES ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Head of Students Services and University Secretary</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce a pregnancy and maternity/paternity policy for students;</li>\n<li>Review arrangements for suspension of studies to make explicit the additional support pertaining to caring responsibilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Progress has been made on the second of suggested activities, with a new Student Deferral Procedure developed and implemented in Semester 2 of 2014/15. The new procedure provides clear guidance for both staff and students about when a deferral is appropriate and how to apply for one. Pregnancy, maternity or paternity leave are noted as examples of valid criteria for a deferral of studies.</p>\n<p>The deferral procedure was developed by the Student Retention and Surveys Team with Registry staff who are jointly responsible for deferrals and withdrawals through the thinking of leaving email address. Feedback was sought from members of the WISeR Board (formerly the Student Retention Project Board), Programme Leaders, Professional Services staff and the Students’ Union.</p>\n<p>The first activity is still under discussion, with a policy statement in the early stages of drafting.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 11: EMBED EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY IN THE CURRICULUM AND IN RESEARCH</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Head of Research and KE Development Unit and Deans of School</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce case studies outwith stereotypes;</li>\n<li>Have mentors who are knowledgeable in relation to particular cultures or beliefs;</li>\n<li>Reduce the barriers students face in accessing study;</li>\n<li>Implement widespread training and awareness of cultural differences;</li>\n<li>Ensure validation panel have requisite training and establish whether equality and diversity is embedded within the curriculum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We consider that an area of good practice in mainstreaming is the University’s Quality Assurance and Enhancement processes. This includes the validation and review of new and established programmes, and the annual monitoring of all programmes.</p>\n<p>During the validation and review process, the checklist for approval panels explicitly invites panel members to consider whether there is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sufficient evidence that the Programme will contribute to widening access and engaging students from non-traditional backgrounds and under-represented groups,</li>\n<li>sufficient evidence of curriculum innovation and development to enhance equality and diversity, as well as to address potential exclusionary aspects of the programme and to encourage students to think globally and locally.</li>\n<li>evidence of inclusive teaching practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is recognised that the learning from the answers to these questions could be more widely shared to promote further inclusivity good practice across the University.</p>\n<p>In terms of embedding equality in research and research practices, the University has, during the last two years:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continued to enhance gender equality initiatives beyond the traditional STEM domain of Athena Swan to promote initiatives such as the Stonewall Equality Index and to participate in the Aurora programme.</li>\n<li>Publicised and implemented the QMU REF Equality Code of Practice.</li>\n<li>Integrated equality and diversity into the QMU submission to REF 2014.</li>\n<li>Received very positive feedback on the staff profile of the REF submission and the wide integration of staff with complex and special circumstances. The number of staff eligible for submission in these categories was significantly above sector averages. QMU has committed to act on the feedback and comments from the HEFCE Equality and Diversity Panel.</li>\n<li>Submitted and publicised REF Equality Impact Statements and analysis of submitted staff with protected characteristics.</li>\n<li>Secured the Athena Swan Bronze award, and now working towards obtaining the Silver award this session.</li>\n<li>Implemented the Vitae Researcher Development Framework and Planner with a section on Equality and Diversity in Research Careers.</li>\n<li>Actively participated in Vitae’s Every Researcher Counts Project (which included, in 2014, allocation of strategic funds to support female contract researcher attendance at key sector events and researcher development initiatives, including the Vitae Part Time Researcher Conference).</li>\n<li>Introduced Maternity coaching to support researchers in their careers pre and post maternity leave.</li>\n<li>Put in place campus based “inspiring women case studies” to showcase positive female role models across a range of positions within the workplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In January 2015, the University received confirmation that it was one of the first of ten UK institutions to retain the HR Excellence Award for Researcher Careers.. Equality and Diversity is a core theme in the QMU action plan for 2014-2018 in support of this award.</p>\n<p>OUTCOME 12: DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO ADVANCING WOMEN’S CAREERS IN STEM SUBJECTS VIA ATHENA SWAN</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Head of Research and KE Development Unit and Theme Leads</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased public engagement activities in science communication.</li>\n<li>Roll out of the QMU Researcher in Residence in Scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following activities have been undertaken:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is an ongoing commitment to the Aurora programme.</li>\n<li>There has been female staff representation at the Scottish Crucible and a female appointment to management committee for the European Crucible.</li>\n<li>There has been an application for Scottish Crucible 2015 submitted by female staff member.</li>\n<li>There was a successful roll out of the Researcher in Residence Scheme and ongoing collaboration and female engagement with the Edinburgh Beltane. New public engagement activity is being progressed with the Royal Botanical Gardens.</li>\n<li>The University hosted a Beltane Breakfast with two QMU female science researchers invited to speak.</li>\n<li>A Beltane Fellowship for Public Engagement in QMU Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language Research Centre (CASL) is being developed. In partnership with the Beltane, the QMU CASL Public Engagement Fellow will continue with the impact-generating knowledge exchange research activities that led to the award of the Queen’s Anniversary Prize (2002) for the clinical application of speech science, phonetics teachers and curriculum designers throughout the university sector.</li>\n<li>There has been a high level of female PIs on innovation voucher bids to increase the translation of research to SMEs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OUTCOME 13: INCREASED EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY IN RESEARCH CAREERS</p>\n<p>Responsibility: Head of Research and KE Development Unit, Deans of Schools and Deputy Principal</p>\n<p>Suggested possible activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diversity in the profile of staff submitted to REF.</li>\n<li>Promotion and implementation of the Equality Code of Practice.</li>\n<li>Implementation of the concordat action plan.</li>\n<li>Re-launch of the QMU Mentoring Scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following activities have been progressed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Key issues for groups with protected equality characteristics are being dealt with via post REF equality impact assessments. In 2013 the University published its Equality Code of Practice for Research and Equality Impact Assessment on our website. Consequently the Concordat is a regular agenda item for the Equality and Diversity Committee which monitors and reviews the mainstreaming of REF good practice in terms of researcher output, standard tariff reductions and equality and diversity in research careers. Active QMU participation in the Vitae Every Researcher Counts project has supported work in this area.</li>\n<li>The University received very positive feedback on the staff profile of the REF submission and the wide integration of staff with complex and special circumstances. The number of staff eligible for submission in these categories was significantly above sector averages. QMU has committed to act on the feedback and comments from the HEFCE Equality and Diversity Panel. A post REF workshop held on 4 December 2014 for Early Career and Contract Research Staff promoted equality and diversity in research careers.</li>\n<li>Equality and Diversity confirmed as core value in the new institutional criteria for the replacement of strategic research themes with centres</li>\n<li>The University has submitted a new Action Plan for 2014-2018 for the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers.</li>\n<li>The University will be undertaking a review of existing mentoring scheme to include maternity coaching and peer to peer coaching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>REVISED OUTCOMES</p>\n<p>Equality Outcomes, updated in line with the reporting set out above, are presented in the tables that follow.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 1153px; height: 5998px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 44px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 230px; height: 44px; padding-left: 40px;\">Evidence Base</th>\n<th style=\"width: 339px; height: 44px; padding-left: 160px;\">Possible activities</th>\n<th style=\"width: 227px; height: 44px;\">PC(s) and general duty</th>\n<th style=\"width: 151px; height: 44px;\">Responsibility</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 440px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 230px; height: 440px;\">Ensure that the workforce of the University represents the community it serves</td>\n<td style=\"width: 230px; height: 440px;\">HESA, Staff Survey 2012 and 2015, Internal HR information</td>\n<td style=\"width: 339px; height: 440px;\">• Promote equality and diversity in selection of staff and in consideration of job descriptions;<br />• Review arrangements for encouraging people with protected characteristics to apply for positions;<br />• Ensure all committees and decision making bodies of the University are representative of its community<br /><br /></td>\n<td style=\"width: 227px; height: 440px;\">Age, Disability, Gender identity, Race, Gender, Sexual orientation, Pregnancy and maternity, Faith and belief; Eliminate unlawful discrimination, foster good relations and advance equality of opportunity.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 151px; height: 440px;\">Head of Human Resources, University Secretary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 242px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 230px; height: 242px;\">Increase retention of mature students</td>\n<td style=\"width: 230px; height: 242px;\">HESA, Student Retention Project Statistics, Outcome Agreement 2015/16 and onwards.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 339px; height: 242px;\">• Target mature students as part of the Student Retention Project</td>\n<td style=\"width: 227px; height: 242px;\">Age and Gender.
