<p><span class="lead"><strong>Can you tell us about your life post-graduation?</strong></span></p>
<p>After graduating from QMU, I went to the University of York to study an MA in Theatre: Writing, Directing and Performance, before further study at Stockholm University. I also worked for the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland for a couple of years; they fund students and research at Scottish universities. I have also been working as a playwright and have had my work performed at the Theatre Royal York, the Outwith Festival, and by Lyceum Youth Theatre and Strange Town Youth Theatre. I also wrote one of the Breakfast Plays for the Traverse Theatre in 2019. In 2018, I had a play shortlisted for the Young Pleasance Playwriting competition, and in 2019 I became a mentored playwright with Playwrights’ Studio Scotland.</p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">The course</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What did you enjoy most about your course? What were the highlights? </span></p>
<p>I liked the variety that the course offered - no module felt the same. It was flexible, so I was also able to pick up a couple of film and media modules to complement the drama and theatre ones I was taking.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Were there any particular course activities you found especially interesting? </span></p>
<p>Working on site-specific performances was both really interesting and challenging, and incredibly useful to have taken part in.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t specifically linked to my course, I loved working with the Costume Design and Construction students and taking part in their costume showcase.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How did your lecturers support your learning? </span></p>
<p>The lecturers at QMU were very supportive and helped me to find the element of theatre that I wanted to turn into my career. If I hadn’t taken the third year Playwriting module with Dr Ksenija Horvat, I don’t think I would be doing what I am now.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in this course? </span></p>
<p>Read everything on the reading lists, and then read some more! Access to a university library is something I miss more than I thought I would.</p>
<p><span class="lead lead-big">Life as a student at QMU</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What's your 'top tip' for making the most of being a student? </span></p>
<p>Get your work done early, then if you need more time, you have it available to you. When I was a student, I felt like I didn’t have a lot of spare time, but compared to now I had loads! I wish I’d been a little more productive with it.</p>
<p>Join a society or club; I was Vice-Chair of the Drama Society for two years, and that was an invaluable learning curve.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What was the most valuable lesson that you learned at university? </span></p>
<p>If someone suggests you read something, just read it and don’t worry about what other people are doing. Always focus on yourself.</p>]]></Value>
