      <Value><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0in;"><strong>Why did you choose to study at Queen Margaret University?</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;">I was very attracted to the idea of studying at a smaller university which prioritised the student experience. I enjoyed my undergraduate degree, however, I completed that at a very large university where I was overwhelmed by the class sizes and sometimes felt very anonymous, like I was just a number. I hoped that my experience at QMU would provide me with a greater sense of belonging in my university life, which thus far it has.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in;"><strong>What interested you about your chosen course?</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;">I have had a deep passion for film and media for almost my entire life. I write and self-publish film analysis in my personal time, and I completed a Bachelors in English and Film Studies which I found incredibly fulfilling. I was interested in continuing my studies at a higher level and developing my knowledge of how the industry functions, leading to greater career prospects.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 12.0pt 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong>What attracted you to study in Edinburgh?</strong><br>I had visited Edinburgh many times before moving here for my studies at QMU.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="I have always adored the city, it is a safe and easy to navigate place that felt like home very quickly." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p style="margin: 12.0pt 0in 12.0pt 0in;">I especially love the way the city of Edinburgh places importance and value on the arts, like film, theatre, comedy and music. It makes it a very attractive place to live for those who are highly creative or immersed in the arts, such as myself.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong>What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been the highlight?</strong><br>The core modules of the course; Scottish Film: Culture, Industry and Practice, Global Film Industries: Theories, Histories, Policies and The Value Chain: Marketing, Sales, Distribution, Exhibition have all been both informative, as well as enjoyable. They deliver high-level scholarly theory in an easily digestible manner, as well as industry knowledge and transferable skills which can hopefully help to set you up for a media-based career. Additionally, they all heavily invite student contribution and the inclusion of our own interests and experience.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="The highlight of the course for me has been my lecturers listening to particular subjects or films I am interested in and incorporating those into their teaching. It creates a learning environment which feels collaborative and tailored around the students." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong>Have you participated in a course activity you found especially interesting?</strong><br>Many universities don’t include in-class presentations as an activity or form of assessment. It’s something I had never done previous to this course. However, I have found it to be a really enriching exercise which has pushed me to refine my ideas. It’s a completely different skill to written essays and so has further expanded my analytical abilities beyond written essays.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong>How have your lecturers supported your learning?</strong><br>Aided by being a small, intimate class group, we have had open access to our lecturers who have taken a hands-on approach in collaborating with us and supporting our learning. They invite all questions, queries and feedback and are dedicated to creating an inclusive, collaborative space.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong>Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in applying for this course?</strong><br>You should enter this course with confidence in your own values, opinions and experiences in reference to the film industry. Be prepared to get involved and be a part of the collaborative learning environment. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or express concerns.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong>What’s your ‘top tip’ for making the most of being a student?</strong><br>Don’t allow fear or insecurity to hold you back from expressing yourself inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Know that your contributions are valued by staff and fellow students, and you will be enhancing the learning experience by offering them." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><br><br><strong>What are your plans after graduation? Tell us about your ambitions and where you </strong><strong>see yourself in the future?</strong> <br>The Global Film Industries MSc course has enriched my knowledge, experience and interest in media and the film industry immensely. I do not yet know exactly what I want to do or where I will end up. However, I can certainly see myself completing a PhD and progressing into a career in academia in the realm of film and media.</p>
