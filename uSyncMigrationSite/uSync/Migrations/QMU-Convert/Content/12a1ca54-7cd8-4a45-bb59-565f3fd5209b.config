They are advised by the Director of Operations &amp; Finance in executing their financial duties. The Director of Operations &amp; Finance will also supervise and approve the financial systems operating within their cost centres, including the form in which accounts and financial records are kept.</p>\n<p>Budget-holders are responsible for establishing and maintaining clear lines of responsibility and accountability within their School or service area for all financial matters.</p>\n<p>Budget-holders will provide the Director of Operations &amp; Finance with such information as may be required to enable (a) compilation of the University’s financial statements, (b) implementation of financial planning; and (c) implementation of audit and financial reviews, projects and value for money studies.</p>\n<p><strong>8.3  All members of staff</strong></p>\n<p>All members of staff of the University and its subsidiary entities shall be aware of, and have a general responsibility for, the security of the University’s property, for avoiding loss and for due economy in the use of resources.</p>\n<p>Members of staff shall ensure that they are aware of the University’s financial authority limits and the values of purchases for which quotations and tenders are required (see Financial Procedures).</p>\n<p>They shall make available any relevant records or information to the Director of Operations &amp; Finance or to their authorised representative in connection with the implementation of the University’s financial policies, these Financial Regulations and the systems of financial control.</p>\n<p>They shall provide the Director of Operations &amp; Finance with such financial and other information as they deem necessary from time to time, to carry out the requirements of University Court.</p>\n<p>Members of staff shall immediately notify the Director of Operations &amp; Finance whenever any matter arises that involves, or is thought to involve, irregularities concerning, <em>inter alia</em>, the funds or property of the University.</p>\n<p><strong>9  Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p>The University acknowledges the risks, including financial risks, inherent in its business and is committed to managing those risks. The University Court has overall responsibility for ensuring that there is a risk management policy and associated Risk Register and that there are appropriate processes for the identification, evaluation and monitoring of individual significant risks. The University Court has responsibility for determining and articulating risk appetite. The University Court has adopted a risk management strategy and this is implemented through the Executive Board and the Audit &amp; Risk Committee.</p>\n<p>Managers must ensure that any agreements negotiated within their areas with external bodies cover any legal liabilities to which the University may be exposed. All contracts must be approved in accordance with the Delegated Authorisation Schedule adopted by the University Court.</p>\n<p><strong>10  Whistleblowing</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Whistleblowing in the context of the Public Interest Disclosure Act is the disclosure by an employee (or other party) of suspected malpractice in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Normally, any concern about a workplace matter at the University should be raised with the relevant member of staff’s immediate line manager. However, the University recognises that the seriousness or sensitivity of some issues, together with the identity of the person the member of staff thinks may be involved, may make this difficult or impossible. If this is the case then reference should be made to the University’s Public Interest Disclosure Policy.</p>\n<p>The full policy and procedures for whistleblowing are set out in the University’s Public Interest Disclosure Policy. QMU Staff and Students can view this policy via the Intranet -  <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://intranet.qmu.ac.uk/sites/humresources/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to QMU Intranet\">http://intranet.qmu.ac.uk/sites/humresources/</a></p>\n<p><strong>11  Code of Conduct </strong></p>\n<p>The University is committed to the highest standards of openness, integrity and accountability. It seeks to conduct its affairs in a responsible manner, having regard to the principles established by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which members of staff at all levels are expected to observe. These principles are set out in Appendix 5.</p>\n<p>Members of University Court, senior officers of the University and all members of staff involved in procurement are required to disclose interests in the University’s Register of Interests maintained by the University Secretary, and to ensure that entries in the Register are kept up to date.</p>\n<p>No member of University Court or member of staff will be a signatory to a contract on behalf of the University where he or she (or a related party) also has a personal interest in the activities of the other party.</p>\n<p>It is an offence within the Bribery Act 2010 for a member the University Court or a member of staff to accept corruptly any gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing, or refraining from doing, anything in an official capacity or showing favour or disfavour to any person in an official capacity. The guiding principles to be followed by all Court members and members of staff must be;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the conduct of individuals should not create suspicion of any conflict between their official duty and their private interest<br /><br /></li>\n<li>the action of individuals acting in an official capacity should not give the impression that they have been (or may have been) influenced by a benefit to show favour or disfavour to any person or organisation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, members of staff and Court members should not accept any gifts, rewards or hospitality (or have them given to members of their families) from any organisation or individual with whom they have contact in the course of their work that would cause them to reach a position whereby they might be, or might be perceived by others to have been, influenced in making a business decision as a consequence of accepting such gifts, rewards or hospitality. <br /><br />The frequency and scale of hospitality accepted should not be significantly greater than the University would be likely to provide in return.</p>\n<p>When it is not easy to decide between what is and what is not acceptable in terms of gifts or hospitality, the offer should be declined or advice sought from the Director of Operations &amp; Finance, who will maintain a register of gifts and hospitality received where the value is other than nominal (ie, greater than £25). Members of staff in receipt of such gifts or hospitality are obliged to notify the Director of Operations &amp; Finance promptly.</p>\n<p>University Court members should seek advice where required from the Secretary to the Court on matters pertaining to conduct.</p>\n<p>See also section 8.3 on staff responsibilities and section 15.4 on corruption and fraud. </p>"

This will include obtaining a set of grant terms and conditions from each organisation providing funding to enable appropriate monitoring of compliance.</p>\n<p>The research agreement must be in line with the institution’s policy with regard to recovering the full economic cost of research projects, taking into account different procedures for the pricing of research depending on the nature of the funding body.</p>\n<p>The Director of Operations &amp; Finance shall maintain financial records relating to all research grants and contracts and shall initiate all claims for reimbursement from sponsoring bodies by the due date. Each grant or contract will have a named principal investigator and will be assigned an unique project code within the School.</p>\n<p>Control of pay and non-pay expenditure may be delegated by the budget-holder to the grant holder but any overspend or under-recovery of overheads is to be the clear responsibility of the School, with any loss being a charge on it.</p>\n<p>Many grant-awarding bodies and contracting organisations stipulate conditions under which their funding is given. In addition, there are often procedures to be followed regarding the submission of interim or final reports or the provision of other relevant information. Failure to respond to these conditions often means that the institution will suffer a significant financial penalty. It is the responsibility of the named grant-holder to ensure that conditions of funding are met. Any loss to the University resulting from a failure to meet conditions of funding will be charged to the School.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure high quality outputs from commercial projects and safeguard the reputation of the University, Research Centre Directors should review quality of outputs prior to presentation to the external funder. Involvement of external reviewers will be required where internal expertise is insufficient and where such external involvement is practicable.</p>\n<p><strong>19 Other income-generating activity<br /><br /></strong><strong>19.1 Commercial activity</strong></p>\n<p>Commercial activity includes all income-generating activity other than core teaching or research funded by a public or charitable body.

Details of new collaborative arrangements must be reported to the University Court on a regular basis.</p>\n<p><strong>19.3 Matched funding </strong></p>\n<p>Any project which involves matched funding requires the approval of the budget-holder, acting on the advice of the Director of Operations &amp; Finance and the Head of Finance, prior to any commitment being entered into. Such approval shall be dependent upon the relevant budget-holder being able to demonstrate that eligible matching funds are available and that the project is financially viable by the application of the University’s costing and pricing policy.</p>\n<p>If the University sub-contracts such work to external providers, the Head of Finance shall ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a written contract approved by the Dean, which allows for full audit access to detailed records</li>\n<li>Appropriate monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that the outputs are achieved and the provision is of suitable quality</li>\n<li>Payments are only made against detailed invoices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>19.4 Intellectual Property </strong></p>\n<p><strong>19.4.1 General </strong></p>\n<p>Certain activities undertaken within the University including research and consultancy may give rise to ideas, designs and inventions which may be patentable.
