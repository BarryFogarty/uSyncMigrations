      "content": "<p>First-rate digital content has one primary quality; it makes us pause and want to look, to hear the message, to discover what happens next. Can the creation of such compelling material be a happy blend of good fortune and good timing?. No it’s not: there is a method, and it can be mastered using skills learned on this practically focused course. By understanding the language of film you will learn how to improve content. Along with campaign strategy, you will learn engaging visual storytelling techniques (such as mise-en-scene, continuity and montage) that are essential for effective short documentaries, adverts or dramas. You will also learn key news-media production skills (such as interviewing, managing, producing, directing, shooting and editing short newsworthy film and other digital content).</p>\n<p>This course has been inspired by the professional experiences of our academic staff and maximises our expertise in PR, film and media. Our media production lecturers have won a host of international awards for their short films and are highly successful on social media. Our PR and communications lecturers have professional and personal campaign experience and are involved with a range of campaigning organisations and have also won awards for their work. Our experience is at the centre of our teaching approach and we always engage students in producing real strategies and content for real clients. This results in campaigns where video and digital content have had a profound effect on audiences and have been crucial in achieving strategic aims and objectives.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>Structure and exit awards</strong></p>\n<p>You can opt to study for the full MSc (180 credits), a PgDip (120 credits) or a PgCert (60 credits).</p>\n<p>You can also register as an associate student to complete a single module for CPD. On completion of a single module, you may wish to complete further modules and progress your studies to a named award. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:ewood@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact Emma Wood\">Contact Emma Wood</a> for more information on single module study.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Our teaching enables you to produce a portfolio of material suitable for satisfying existing or impressing future employers. You will work in groups during workshops to develop and test your knowledge and work on an individual basis to produce assessments that will include campaign strategies, case studies, a variety of short films and other content. You will work for an extended period, supervised by a QMU lecturer, to create strategic communication material for a client or organisation of your choice. You can also chose to undertake an industry placement or build a digital portfolio to enhance your professional aspirations. We are particularly proud of our strong links with organisations that agree to be placement hosts or live clients for our students.</p>\n<p>Students on the MSc in Digital Campaigning and Content Creation will utilise our film and video editing suites, which includes a subscription to the Adobe Creative Cloud (that will be installed on your PC/Mac) suite for the length of the course and access to latest range of camera equipment like the Black Magic Ursa and the latest Sony cameras and Canon lenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement/industry-based learning</strong></p>\n<p>This is an ideal course for building on the theory you learn with some practical experience. You can choose to undertake 150 hours to integrate practice with theory, by working directly with clients and organisations. Students are responsible for securing their own placement host and related costs (eg travel and accommodation) but we will help you with CVs and provide networking opportunities with a range of organisations with whom we have strong relationships.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>We teach most of our modules in half-day blocks so that we can facilitate practical and group work as well as more formal lectures. We find that students enjoy this approach and lecturers can be more creative and involved in the learning experience. We also timetable most teaching to take place on Fridays and Saturdays to enable people in full-time work or with caring responsibilities to take part. But you may have at least one  elective which runs mid-week. Your specific timetable will depend on the electives you choose and whether you study full-time or part-time. Each 20-credit core module will typically involve four or five Fridays or Saturdays each semester. The taught semesters run from September to December and mid-January to mid-April. As it is an intensive course, we advise people working full-time to study with us part-time.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Class sizes will depend on modules chosen but will normally be between 10-30 students. Workshops will be restricted in size and you will work in small groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>"

      "content": "<p>To obtain a PgCert, you will complete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strategic Communication and Digital Practice (20 credits):</strong> On this module students develop a critical understanding of the role of strategic communication within wider contexts including business, organisations, agencies, campaign groups and NGOs. They take a critical perspective to ethics, social responsibility and social justice and explore how strategic communication can impact on society.  Theory is applied to produce creative communication campaigns including a range of communication activities and digital tactics.</li>\n<li><strong>Visual Storytelling for Media Campaigns (20 credits):</strong>  The art of storytelling is as old as the human race itself and our earliest forms of communication were deeply visual in nature. Even today, that hasn’t changed. In fact, if anything, having a mastery of visual storytelling techniques has become more important than ever. The success of our campaigning, marketing, advertising, and much of our digital entertainment relies on a solid understanding of such skills.  This module will facilitate critical understanding of narrative techniques and enable students to plan, manage and produce campaign films, appropriate for submission to an organisation, client or broadcaster. The assessment is an Individual production project (a short documentary or a number of adverts or a drama film related to a client’s campaign).  </li>\n<li><strong>Digital Content Creation for Campaigns (20 credits):</strong> Students will explore and practice techniques of digital content production for a client / organisation using digital capture devices &amp; editing software to produce finished projects. This module will focus on factual media content. Students investigate and report on hard news, soft news documentary as well as developing production material. Techniques of news gathering including interview techniques and reporting are covered. This includes all aspects of video production, as well as journalism, feature photography and dissemination via print and online media. Students will be introduced to most available digital formats and shown how to upload visual digital content to online channels and social media. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To obtain a PgDip, you will also complete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong><strong>Digital Communications (20 credits): </strong></strong></strong>The evolution, diffusion, and adoption of digital technologies have fundamentally altered the way we live, work, relate to one another, and conduct business. These technological and societal changes are having a far-reaching impact on the communications, public relations and marketing disciplines, presenting huge challenges as well as opportunities to the industry. This module provides a sound theoretical and practical knowledge of digital communications based on a critical understanding of current and emerging technologies, digital strategies and social media platforms. The module examines a number of topics including: digital strategy; social media; search engine optimisation; online community building and management; stakeholders analysis; issues management; web analytics and big data; content marketing; online customer journey; ethical and legal aspects of digital communications; and more.</li>\n<li>plus two 20-credit electives from across the division choose from international marketing, business and media modules or Industry-based Learning; Fundraising, Development and Finance; Public Affairs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For an MSc you will also complete a Master’s Communication Project (60 credits).</p>\n<p>NB The modules listed are correct at time of posting (October 2023) but are subject to change.
