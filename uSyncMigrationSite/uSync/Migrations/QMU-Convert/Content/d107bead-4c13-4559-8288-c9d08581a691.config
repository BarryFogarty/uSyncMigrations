<p>21.3   Students are not permitted to substantially reproduce the same piece of course work for more than one assignment, except where they are explicitly required to do so by the assignment specification.</p>
<p>21.4   If a student is found to have cheated, or attempted to gain an unfair advantage, the Board of Examiners, following a recommendation from the Dean or Disciplinary Panel, has authority to deem the student to have failed part or all of the assessment and to determine whether or not the student shall be permitted to be re-assessed. Students must ensure the proper acknowledgement of the borrowings from other sources, whether published or unpublished. Divisions should provide guidance on how such borrowings should be acknowledged in a manner appropriate to that discipline.</p>
<p>21.5   Fraudulent practices such as copying, cheating, collusion, plagiarism (i.e. the presentation by an individual of another person’s ideas or work, in any medium, published or unpublished, as though they were their own) are serious academic offences and will incur appropriate penalties. Students must not submit work obtained from an essay bank or website essay writing service. Students are urged to seek advice from academic staff or the Effective Learning Service if in any doubt about the foregoing practices. All students are expected to seek clear guidance on the form and manner in which assessments are to be completed.</p>
<p>21.6   Serious cases of cheating and plagiarism will be referred for consideration through the University’s disciplinary procedure. Undertaking fraudulent practices can result in a student being required to leave the University.</p>
<p>21.7   QMU has a policy to use the TurnItIn UK plagiarism detection system, or other equivalent systems, to help students avoid plagiarism and improve their scholarship skills. This service is available to all matriculated students at QMU. Academic staff may submit student work to TurnItIn UK or another equivalent system.</p>]]></Value>

      "content": "<p><strong>24.1     Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>24.1.1 The University’s degrees and other academic awards are given in recognition of the candidate’s achievement. Plagiarism is therefore, together with other forms of academic dishonesty such as personation, falsification of data, computer and calculation fraud, examination room cheating and bribery, considered an act of academic fraud and is an offence against University discipline.</p>\n<p>24.1.2 Plagiarism is defined as follows:</p>\n<p><em>The presentation by an individual of another person’s ideas or work (in any medium, published or unpublished) as though they were their own</em>.</p>\n<p>24.1.3 In the following circumstances academic collusion represents a form of plagiarism:</p>\n<p><em>Academic collusion is deemed to be unacceptable where it involves the unauthorised and unattributed collaboration of students or others work resulting in plagiarism, which is against University discipline.</em></p>\n<p>24.1.4 QMU has a policy to use the TurnItIn UK plagiarism detection system, or other equivalent systems, to help students avoid plagiarism and improve their scholarship skills. This service is available to all matriculated students at QMU. QMU tutors may submit student work to TurnItIn UK, or another equivalent system.</p>\n<p><strong>24.2     Referencing</strong></p>\n<p>Students’ attention is drawn to the Library’s <a href=\"https://libguides.qmu.ac.uk/referencing\">guide to referencing</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>24.3     Prevention</strong></p>\n<p>24.3.1 All members of staff should explain to their students at the start of each session that plagiarism and academic fraud are unacceptable forms of cheating, which will be penalised severely. Such warnings should be repeated during the session and are especially necessary where dissertations, projects or coursework are substantial elements of the curriculum. Every opportunity should be taken to reinforce this message by incorporating it in published material such as Programme or scheme guides and, in the case of postdoctoral candidates, by its inclusion in the Research Degrees Code of Practice/Doctoral Candidate Handbooks (PhD and Professional Doctorate).</p>\n<p>24.3.2 These warnings should be accompanied by specific advice from Divisions about what constitutes plagiarism and academic fraud. For example, such advice should indicate where a particular discipline makes the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate use of acknowledged or unacknowledged sources; what is regarded as acceptable collaboration between students undertaking joint project work; and what is expected of a dissertation or thesis. Dissertations should clearly indicate whether it is an original contribution to knowledge or a critical survey of published material. Training students to make such distinctions is part of the academic process and should be formally and publicly acknowledged as such. This is particularly significant since some of the cases arising stem from genuine ignorance on the part of the students who have never received guidance on how to acknowledge sources properly.</p>\n<p>24.3.3 Scrutiny of academic work should be sufficient to ensure that signs of plagiarism or unacceptable levels of co-operation, whether intentional or not, are detected at an early stage and brought to students’ attention through tutorial guidance and in some cases perhaps by written warning.</p>\n<p>24.3.4 Dissertation supervisors and other academic staff responsible for assessment and guidance should be aware of cultural relativities that may affect some students’ approach to referencing. In providing guidance, staff will be expected to acknowledge cultural differences and to exercise appropriate sensitivity.</p>\n<p><strong>24.4     Identifying, reporting and investigating</strong></p>\n<p>Procedures for identifying, reporting and investigating plagiarism are published separately in the University’s <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/aaf144ba36b2432ba477279a110c49b3}\" title=\"Plagiarism Policy\">Plagiarism Policy</a>.</p>"

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p>21.0   Student responsibility in assessment</p>
<p>21.1     It is the responsibility of students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarise themselves with the regulations for their programme. Students should consult their Programme Handbook and/or their Academic Tutor;</li>
<li>recognise the role of assessment in the achievement and recognition of their learning;</li>
<li>familiarise themselves with the examination periods (both first attempt and reassessment and make themselves available for the examination period);</li>
<li>attend written examinations and observe the University’s Instruction to Candidates in Examinations (to be read out to students prior to the start of examinations). In brief, these require candidates to attend in good time, to bring their matriculation card, not to communicate with other candidates, not to cheat, not to disrupt the event, to complete the answer paper as instructed, not to bring into the hall any unauthorised material and not to remove any part of an answer paper from the hall;</li>
<li>attend all other types of assessment, for example, practical examinations, class tests and presentations;</li>
<li>submit all work for assessment in accordance with the requirements for their programme;</li>
<li>provide evidence, in advance of the Board of Examiners, of any extenuating circumstances. This evidence is normally written by an independent source such as a medical practitioner and should be forwarded to the School Office in the first instance. Students should be aware that Boards of Examiners will take account of all certificated or verified evidence submitted on behalf of students in their deliberations on individual performance.</li>
