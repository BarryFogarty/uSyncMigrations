      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-one-year-old Jemma McCann graduated with BA (Hons) Events Management on Tuesday 9 July after several years of study at the Musselburgh campus, which saw her juggle academic responsibilities and work commitments at a Glasgow hotel in her final year – no easy feat.</p>
<p>Jemma’s interest in events management was sparked while in sixth year at Uddingston Grammar School. “I organised my first ever event – a 1950s-inspired fundraising day for Alzheimer’s Scotland in memory of my gran,” she explained. “It was this experience which gave me a taste of working within events and hospitality.”</p>
<p>Armed with volunteering experience and having already secured a job in the hospitality industry, Jemma applied to QMU’s Events Management course to pursue her career goals and aspirations. In her own words: “It was the best decision of my life.”</p>
<p>Jemma’s work ethic and commitment didn’t go unnoticed while at QMU. She was awarded the Lord Forte Foundation Scholarship in her final year of study, which carries with it a £2,500 financial award to help recipients excel in their studies.</p>
<p>Travelling from Hamilton to Edinburgh for university was proving expensive for Jemma, and with the responsibility of household bills and car maintenance costs, she would sometimes be left short for buying food and other necessities. Thanks to the scholarship, the burden of money worries was alleviated and Jemma was able to focus solely on achieving her undergraduate degree. Crossing the stage of the Usher Hall on Tuesday to collect her degree from Chancellor Prue Leith CBE made all her struggles and hard work worthwhile.</p>
<p>Jemma plans to stay within the hotel industry and is currently working at the Holiday Inn. She has ambitions to one day move into corporate events planning.</p>
<p>To anyone considering studying at Queen Margaret University, Jemma has some words of wisdom: “Go for it! If you have any questions about courses, the University is so helpful and is always more than happy to welcome new students who have any queries.</p>
<p>“I want to use my experience at QMU to inspire other students to make the most of their time here and to enjoy it to the full. My experience has been one I will never forget.”</p>
