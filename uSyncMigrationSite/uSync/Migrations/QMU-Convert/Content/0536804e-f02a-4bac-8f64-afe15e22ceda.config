      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this policy is to support consistency in practice across the University in terms of the anticipation, identification and promotion of good practice in the preparation and presentation of learning and teaching materials. We aim to mainstream inclusive practices which benefit disabled students but also all students irrespective of background and protected characteristics.</p>
<p>The policy aids the systematic consideration of the effects of teaching, learning and assessment practice at the point of planning, implementation and evaluation to ensure that learning and teaching is inclusive of all students.</p>
<p>This policy aims at maximising the inclusivity of learning and teaching, so that all our students have equal access to their course of study and its learning materials. This is consistent with the aspiration set out in the <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/f6e001e6ee0c4cd39d6aa7977885b401}" title="Student Experience Strategy">Student Experience Strategy</a> that we will be committed to social justice, recognising equality and diversity in all that we do.</p>]]></Value>

      "content": "<p>The principles of this policy are in line with our duty to make reasonable adjustments under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents\">Equality Act 2010</a>. This duty requires education providers to take positive steps to ensure that students with a disability can fully participate in their education and enjoy the benefits, facilities and services which education providers offer.</p>\n<p>This approach is embedded in the <a href=\"https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/guidance/teaching-and-learning/ukpsf\">United Kingdom Professional Standards Framework</a> for teaching and supporting learning in higher education as well the <a href=\"https://www.enhancementthemes.ac.uk/\">QAA Enhancement Themes</a>.</p>\n<p>This policy supports mainstreaming as a principle aimed at embedding inclusive practices and policies within higher education with the goal of achieving and standardising equality and diversity. Mainstreaming can help to eradicate everyday inequalities, normalise discussion surrounding protected characteristics and improve student and staff experience by fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging. This policy supports the introduction of mainstreaming to improve inclusion in learning and teaching through the following measures:</p>\n<p>2.1. Adopting certain types of academic support (reasonable adjustments) frequently recommended by the Disability Service as standard practices, which can benefit all students. The following measures will be seen as standard practice in all courses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students being allowed to audio record lectures for personal use as set out in the IT policy. Students will need to inform the lecturer that they are recording, and the recording will be strictly for personal use.</li>\n<li>Students being allowed to leave the classroom without permission</li>\n<li>Lecture notes/slides should as far as possible be provided 24 hours in advance to all students</li>\n<li>All recordings to use captions/subtitles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.2. Reasonable adjustments used to remove barriers for disabled students as much as is practically possible in order to ensure they can access all learning and teaching materials.</p>\n<p>2.3. All materials produced by the University in support of its learning and teaching activities should be following accessibility guidelines to be inclusive of as broad a range of students as possible.</p>\n<p>2.4. The mainstreaming of the preparation, presentation and evaluation of teaching and learning activities will be continually reviewed and developed to ensure that the need for reasonable adjustments for individual students will be minimised.</p>"

It is recognised that collaborative partners may have access to different levels of infrastructure to support learning and teaching, depending on the nature of their agreement, and may employ different methods of communication and sharing of learning materials. Partners in different countries may also be subject to different legislation.</p>\n<p>Through the process of working together and sharing good practice from QMU, Collaborative Academic Leads will encourage partners to adopt inclusive learning approaches that will be effective in their context.</p>"

For all items, book chapters and relevant page numbers should be indicated. Additional reading may be recommended nearer to the start date of the module and during the module.</p>\n<p>6.2. Reading lists should indicate priority and/or relevance. The key purpose is so that students can prioritise their own reading.</p>\n<p>6.3. There may still be a need to provide some specific support tailored to individual visually impaired students, identified by the Disability Advisers. In these cases, the Academic Disabled Student Coordinators will work with relevant teaching staff, the liaison librarian and the Disability Adviser to identify and prioritise texts that require conversion to an alternative format.</p>\n<p>6.4. Reading lists should be supplied by module co-ordinators to the Liaison Librarian a minimum of eight weeks before the module is due to begin, with an indication of expected use and demand of the resource. This will ensure the Learning Resource Centre has sufficient time to identify, purchase and ensure core materials are available in appropriate formats.</p>\n<p>6.5. In order to support the principle of inclusive learning and teaching materials, and to maximise accessibility, the Learning Services will normally include the purchase of electronic versions of reading list items.</p>\n<p>6.6. It should be clearly indicated which of those readings are key to the module or particularly relevant to a session or theme within the module. It is not necessary for the whole reading list to be ordered. Neither is it expected that students should read only from the reading list provided; they will be expected, through their own research, to identify further readings.</p>\n<p>6.7. In some subjects, the compilation of a reading list may be central to the assessment task and therefore no set reading list is provided. Where this is the case, it should be communicated clearly to students as part of the module information.</p>"

Where the virtual learning environment is not used, students must be informed of how to access the materials. Teaching staff will not be expected to produce presentation slides if slides are not appropriate for the content of the session. In these cases, the lecturer, tutor or module co-ordinator will provide an outline of the session 24 hours in advance of the session. This may take the form of a bullet-pointed list of the key themes/content of the lecture/class: it is not required that detailed notes are provided.</p>\n<p>7.3 Judgement will need to be exercised in such cases where confidential or ‘spoiler’ information is contained within materials so as not to compromise confidentiality or impinge on the pedagogical experience. In such cases students should be informed of the presence of such information and may only be provided with partial presentation slides in advance of the class; the full materials to be made available following the class.</p>\n<p>7.4 Students should be notified of changes to modules/classes as soon as possible.</p>"

Use a sans serif font such as, Arial, Verdana or Calibri.</p>\n<p>8.4. Use a minimum size 12-point font – the font should be large enough to be read easily by most people.</p>\n<p>8.5. Write in plain English, avoiding jargon except for technical words.</p>\n<p>8.6. Text should be left aligned. There should be enough white space to break up the text. This can be done by adjusting line and paragraph spacing settings.</p>\n<p>8.7. Use bullets and numbering.</p>\n<p>8.8. All pages should be numbered.</p>\n<p>8.9. Use the built-in header styles in Microsoft Word – this then enables users to use the navigation pane to move around the document.</p>\n<p>8.10. Make use of diagrams, flow charts, screen-shots, summary boxes and callouts to provide additional visual explanation. Consistently used pictograms can draw attention to important procedures or hazards.</p>\n<p>8.11. When using tables, the header row should be specified and repeated across different pages.</p>\n<p>8.12. Add ‘alt-text’ to tables and images which describes the appearance and/or function of the image or table.</p>\n<p>8.13. Images should be used in such a way as not to obscure text.</p>\n<p>8.14. There should be sufficient contrast between the text and the background.</p>\n<p>8.15. Where possible, use non-glossy paper, off-white is preferred for printed documents.</p>\n<p>8.16. Use hyperlinks so that readers can easily move to information in the same document, a different document or a web page. When using links ensure text is concise and meaningful. Do not use text such as “link”, “here” or full URL’s as this cannot be read easily by a screen reader.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Alt-text (or alt tags) refers to text that is associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image itself. Alt-text is used to help people using a screen reader to understand the content of images and other non-text content in a document.</em></p>"
