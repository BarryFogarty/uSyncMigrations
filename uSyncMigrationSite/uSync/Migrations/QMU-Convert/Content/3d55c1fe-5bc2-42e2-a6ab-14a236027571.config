You will be expected to take overall responsibility for your learning. Teaching methods will include keynote lectures, clinical workshops and tutorials, student-led seminars, group discussions, clinical observation and practice. Directed learning materials will be delivered via a virtual learning environment (the HUB) and comprise reading, self-assessment, videos and lecture slides. Clinical skills will be developed in radiotherapy departments around Scotland.</p>\n<p>A variety of assessment structures will be used including online examinations, self-appraisal, course work, ePortfolio, viva voce, examinations, presentations and clinical assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements will take place within the five centres within Scotland, with the opportunity to undertake a 2-week elective in Year Two. </p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by both our <strong>Master of Radiography: Therapeutic (MRad)</strong> and <strong>MSc Therapeutic Radiography (Pre-Registration)</strong> courses. We have a range of equipment available to simulate different aspects of the clinical environment. Our clinical rooms include positioning lasers and a range of immobilisation equipment to allow us to replicate patient positioning and set up scenarios. We also have our computer planning suite which allows us to plan radiotherapy treatments, explore image verification and patient management. Students have access to numerous anatomy models which are incorporated into their learning during practical sessions and can be used during self-directed study sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module you study will be made up of attendance in class and independent work. The structure of each module is different with different attendance requirements for each timetabled module.</p>\n<p>Attendance at professional modules is monitored to ensure safety working in the clinical environment. Students will normally complete the course via a full-time route and clinical placements will take place within the normal working day of a therapeutic radiographer (full-time Monday to Friday).</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Normally 10-12 students are enrolling on the course each year. Most of the classes are delivered with our undergraduate Master of Radiography: Therapeutic (MTRad) students with some classes delivered across the division with Master of Physiotherapy (MPhys) and Master of Podiatry (MPod) students.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
