<p>You agree to sell and We agree to purchase the Goods in accordance with the Contract. The Contract shall comprise (in order of precedence): any Order Amendments, the Purchase Order, these General Conditions of Purchase, any other document (or part document) referred to on the Purchase Order. The Contract shall not include any of Your conditions of sale, notwithstanding reference to them in any document. However, should this Contract be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to include Your terms and conditions of sale then in the event of any conflict or apparent conflict these General Conditions of Purchase shall always prevail over Your terms and conditions of sale. Delivery of Goods in response to a Purchase Order or Order Amendment shall be taken to imply that You have accepted the terms and conditions of this Contract.</p>
<div class="page">

You must allow Us at least 10 working days to consider any new Price and delivery date. The Order Amendment shall take effect when but only if Our Authorised Officer accepts in writing the new Price and delivery date within the time You stipulate. If Our Authorised Officer fails to confirm the Order Amendment within the time You stipulate then performance of the Contract shall immediately resume as though the said Order Amendment had not been issued (except that We may still exercise Our right of cancellation in accordance with Condition 5).</p>
