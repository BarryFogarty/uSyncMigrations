<p>We are the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), a regulator set up to protect the public. To do this, we keep a register of health and care professionals who meet our standards for their training, professional skills and behaviour.</p>
<p>Professionals on our Register are called ‘registrants’. We currently regulate the following professions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>  Arts therapists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Biomedical scientists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Chiropodists / podiatrists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Clinical scientists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Dietitians</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Hearing aid dispensers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Occupational therapists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Operating department practitioners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Orthoptists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Paramedics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Physiotherapists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Practitioner psychologists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Prosthetists / orthotists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Radiographers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Speech and language therapists</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You can find an up-to-date list of the professions we regulate on our website at www.hcpc-uk.org</p>
<p>Each of these professions has one or more titles that is protected by law (such as ‘physiotherapist’ and ‘dietitian’). Anyone who misuses a protected title is breaking the law and could be prosecuted.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Another important part of our role is to consider any concerns raised about our registrants to decide whether they are ‘fit to practise’. When we say that someone is ‘fit to practise’ we mean that they have the knowledge, skills and character to practise their profession safely and effectively. We look at every concern to decide whether or not we need to take action. Based on the information we have collected we may hold a hearing to decide whether someone is fit to practise.</p>
<p>We also set standards for continuing professional development (CPD), which all registrants must meet. Meeting these standards supports professionals in their learning and development once they are registered so that they can continue to practise safely and effectively.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">How the HCPC is run</span></p>
<p>We were created by the Health Professions Order 2001, which sets out the things that we must do and gives us our legal power. We have a council which is made up of both registrants and lay members. The Council sets our strategies and policies, and makes sure that we are meeting our responsibilities under the Health Professions Order 2001.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">The standards of conduct, performance and ethics</span></p>
<p>We set standards of conduct, performance and ethics, which apply to the professionals we regulate and set out in broad terms how we expect our registrants to behave. You will learn about these standards on your programme.</p>
<p>The standards also apply to people who are applying to join our Register. In this case we will ask you to sign a declaration to confirm that you have read, and will keep to, the standards once you are registered.</p>
<p>The standards help us make decisions about the character of the people who apply to join our Register and in cases where we decide whether someone is fit to practise.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Approving education programmes</span></p>
<p>We also assess education programmes against our standards of education and training. If a programme meets our standards, we approve it and the students who successfully complete the programme are eligible to apply to register with us.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Our Register</span></p>
<p>Being on our Register shows that you meet our standards for your profession.</p>
<p>Our Register shows the public that these professionals are fit to practise and that they are entitled to use the protected title for their profession. It shows that the people on our Register are part of a profession with nationally recognised standards set by law.</p>
<p>Our Register is available on our website at www.hcpc-uk.org/check and allows you to search online for a registered health and care professional.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Applying to be on our Register</span></p>
<p>Completing an approved programme does not guarantee that you will become registered. But it does show us that you meet our professional standards for registration and so you are eligible to apply. We need more information from you to be able to register you.</p>
<p>When you first apply to go on our Register, as part of your application you need to send us information, which includes a character and health declaration, a photograph and copies of relevant identification. You will also need to let us know other relevant information, including whether you have any convictions or cautions. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply to an application to join our Register. This means that you must tell us about any convictions and cautions you may have, including those that are considered ‘spent’ under the Act (other than a protected conviction or protected caution).</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In most cases, the information you give us about your character will not affect whether or not we register you. For more information on applying for registration and providing relevant character information, please see our Guidance on health and character which is available on our website.</p>
<p>The information we need from you helps us to make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are who you say you are;</li>
<li>you meet our standards; and</li>
<li>we can contact you if we need to.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="lead">About this guidance</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This guidance is based on the standards of conduct, performance and ethics, because those standards apply to both registrants and those applying to be registered. We hope that this guidance will make you more familiar with those standards and that it provides extra information about some of the issues which you may come across as you complete your approved programme. Although we do not regulate students, we do expect them to understand our standards of conduct, performance and ethics in preparation for when they<br />are registered.</p>
<p>The headings we use in the following section of this document are taken from the standards of conduct, performance and ethics. Under each heading we have provided bullet points which give guidance on how the standards relate to you as students. The guidance does not provide answers to every situation you may face. However, we hope that it will help you and encourage you to ask for extra information from your education provider or practice placement provider (if appropriate).</p>
<p>Education providers and practice placement providers often have their own policies and procedures which you should also follow. We recognise the important role of education providers and practice placement providers in helping and supporting students to meet the guidance.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Delegation</span></p>
<p>We recognise that the issue of delegation will be more relevant to some students than others and particularly those reaching the end of their approved programme. These students will have developed their knowledge and skills over an extended period, which may allow them to delegate certain tasks under certain conditions. A registrant is ultimately responsible for the tasks which have been delegated by a student under their supervision, as set out in the standards of conduct, performance and ethics (standard 4.2).</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Language</span></p>
<p>This guidance applies to all students as far as possible. We approve a wide range of programmes, so students are involved in many settings with different models of supervision. We have tried to use words and language which everyone can understand.</p>
<p>The language used in the guidance plays an important role in distinguishing the scope of practice and expectations of students and prospective students from those of registrants and prospective registrants. We use the verb <strong>‘should’</strong> rather than ‘must’ in the guidance, to reflect the fact that we do not regulate students. This differs from the language used in the Standards of conduct, performance and ethics.</p>
<p>We have used the term <strong>‘student’</strong> throughout this document to refer to anyone studying or training on an approved education and training programme which leads to them being eligible to apply to join our Register. The word <strong>‘programme’</strong> means an approved education and training programme.</p>
<p>Throughout this guidance we have used <strong>‘service users’</strong> to refer to anyone who uses or is affected by the work of registrants or students, for example patients and clients. We have used ‘carer’ to refer to anyone who looks after, or provides support to, a family member, partner or friend.</p>
<p>We understand that students may come into contact with a service user for a number of reasons while completing their approved programme or attending their practice placement. This can include carrying out diagnostic or monitoring procedures, or providing therapy or advice. We have referred to these actions in the guidance as <strong>‘care, treatment or other services’.</strong></p>

<p><span class="lead">Personal and professional conduct</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>On your programme you have the opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge you need to become a professional in an environment which protects the public. You also have the opportunity to learn about the behaviour that the public expects from a registrant.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>As a student studying to become a professional in a regulated profession, you have certain responsibilities. On your programme you will be expected to meet high standards of conduct<br />and ethics.</p>
<p>You should be aware that in very serious circumstances, your conduct may affect your ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete your programme;</li>
<li>gain the final qualification; or</li>
<li>register with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of our approved programmes have processes in place for dealing with concerns about a student’s profession-related conduct. This means that misconduct may affect your ability to complete your programme.
