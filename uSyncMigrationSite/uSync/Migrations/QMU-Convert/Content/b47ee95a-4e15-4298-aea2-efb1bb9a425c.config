<p><span class="lead">Welcome from the Head of Graduate School</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>A very warm welcome to Queen Margaret University’s Graduate School. We are delighted that you have chosen to undertake your programme of doctoral study with us, and we look forward to supporting you with this over the next few years.</p>
<p>Enrolling on a doctoral degree is one of the biggest decisions you have made regarding your education and learning in your career. Gaining a doctorate level</p>
<p>qualification requires significant personal discipline, time and commitment to your study. The sense of achievement at the end, though, is immense, and gaining a doctorate opens up many opportunities for career advancement.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>It is not uncommon for doctoral candidates to view their study as being all about their PhD or Prof Doc and consisting mainly of a ‘solo’ research activity, involving many extended hours of reading and/or writing papers and chapters. At QMU, however, we encourage you to see this period of study as a doctoral level learning programme that requires an intensive period of learning across a full range of research skills – after all, it can be the launch-pad for future career development and progression. The programme is about gaining that doctoral award, however, it involves so much more. For example, the Researcher Enhancement and Development (READ) programme, teaching, networking and other relevant scholarly contributions within the Research Centre or Institute and Division you are attached to that develop your doctoral level capabilities.</p>
<p>We also want your doctoral programme experience to be based around feeling part of a learning community. The importance and power of peer support cannot be underestimated during doctoral level study, so please make sure you engage in the community of doctoral candidates, supervisors and academics that exists at QMU. Because in the end it is the community of learning that grounds you and your study and gives you the strength to stay engaged and curious, and to design and craft your thesis.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Finally, you will find further information on the Graduate School throughout this Handbook, including details of colleagues who can support you with different queries and stages of your journey. If you are unsure, at any point, who to contact, please send a message to our generic email address: <a href="mailto:GraduateSchool@qmu.ac.uk" title="Graduate School Email Address">Graduate School Email Address</a>. Typically, our Graduate School Officer will be your first point of contact and they can let you know whether there is anyone else you need to contact with your query.</p>

QMU was the first University in Scotland to deliver a Doctoral Certificate of this kind. The programme was developed with financial support from the <a href=\"https://scqf.org.uk\" title=\"Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF)\">Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF)</a> partnership, which was awarded in recognition of our innovative approach.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>There are three modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Innovative and Creative Approaches to Research</li>\n<li>The Researcher as Instrument</li>\n<li>Researcher Resilience and Career Development</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aims and learning outcomes for each module are embedded into the doctoral development weeks and other learning opportunities. You will also be able to discuss READ within your research supervision.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>The benefits to you</strong></p>\n<p>The READ programme offers you the opportunity to gain a Doctoral Certificate in Researcher Enhancement and Development in addition to your Doctoral Degree. This is in recognition of the wider work that you already undertake to support your doctoral studies. For example, you will already be monitoring your own development needs and, where appropriate, you will decide on learning activities based on those needs. As a doctoral candidate, you are probably already keeping some form of critically reflective diary about your doctoral journey. Within READ, it is this critical reflection that is summatively assessed for academic credit. Successful completion of READ will allow you to demonstrate to potential employers a list of transferable skills proving your capability of working at SCQF level 12.</p>\n<p>There are two points within the academic year when you can submit your reflective account for summative assessment. It needs to be emphasised that the READ programme is based on the premise of providing academic credit for work that you are already engaged with. Therefore, there is no additional workload associated for you beyond completing the assessment component.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>READ assessment requirements</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>By the end of the three years you will have constructed three ePortfolios that consist of evidence to support your ongoing researcher development through use of blogs, reflexive accounts, critical commentaries and mappings. This work is accompanied by a critical reflective report of your learning (2000 words).</p>\n<p>If you are full-time candidate, you will submit a piece of work for summative assessment (20 credits) annually, which is a cumulative assessment process. At the end of three years, you will have accumulated 60 credits, which equates to a Doctoral Certificate in Researcher Enhancement and Development. This timetable is more flexible for part-time candidates, but usually works on a pro rata basis, as explained here:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Assessment routes for full and part-time students</strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 54px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">phD Level</th>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">Assessments</th>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">Comments</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Full-time candidates</strong></p>\n<p>PhD and Professional Doctorate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>One assessment to be submitted once a year</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Candidates will be offered two points within each year when they can submit their work for assessment</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Part-time candidates</strong></p>\n<p>PhD and Professional Doctorate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>One assessment to be submitted over a two year period</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Candidates will be offered four points within each two year period when they can submit their work for assessment</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>READ Case Study</strong></p>\n<p>The below case study was provided by PhD candidate Shawn Soh following successful completion of the READ module:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>My positive experience of READ programme (Sept 2018 – Aug 2021)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em>I approached READ with humility. Metacognitive-led questions like “What am I doing?”, “Why am I doing this?”, “Would someone do this in another (or better) way?” and “Why would I accept (or reject) that approach?” constantly streamed in my mind. In other words, I challenged my ontological positioning and my epistemological posture to see how I could be a better researcher. I had continuously made a significant effort to recognise the philosophical stances of others to have constructive and enriching meetings of minds. For my PhD, I aimed to develop a measurement instrument of balance recovery confidence for the community-dwelling older adults. The READ program has helped me be a mindful researcher centring my focus to be older person- centred. Completing the READ program has been rewarding. I’m pleased that some of these reflections have been published in the form of two articles types (critical reflection on practice development and original practice development and research) in an international peer-reviewed journal, the International Practice and Development Journal (IPDJ).</em></p>\n<p><em>What are some tips and tricks for candidates starting on this program? First, approach the program with an open mind. From the quote of Professor Isaac Asimov, “Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in”. It is acceptable to agree or to disagree expressed by other people, but it is essential to value the diversity of opinions. Second, set a dedicated time and safe space for critical reflection. It is not easy to expose our vulnerabilities and personal biases. However, by doing so, we would learn more about our strengths and acquire practical strategies strived within QMU’s nurturing and conducive community to be better researchers. Lastly, build inclusive relationships within QMU local and international student population. QMU has over 5,000 students from around 80 countries. The cultural-rich peer interactions have provided immense insights to see the world differently. Be amazed about the world of research. Look forward to making your humble contribution to the vast world of knowledge as part of the QMU community.</em></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Should doctoral candidates have any questions or queries about READ please email <a href=\"mailto:GraduateSchool@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Graduate School Email Address\">Graduate School</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Feeling isolated can be detrimental to motivation so <strong>candidates studying off-campus at a distance are normally expected (at a minimum) to:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Attend the three development weeks held in September, January and April of their first year of studies.</li>\n<li>Visit campus to meet with supervisors, University colleagues and peers face to face at least 3 times during each academic year of study.</li>\n<li>Visit campus in person to defend your XD011 presentation.</li>\n<li>Attend campus in person to defend your Prof Doc research at final viva.</li>\n<li>Join the DCA and attend social events organised by the Doctoral Candidates’ Association (DCA) during development weeks, including the Annual Doctoral Researchers’ Conference.</li>\n<li>Maintain contact with supervisors, peers and the DCA, as getting involved can help you to feel included and will offer support if you are feeling isolated or demotivated.</li>\n<li>Engage in social media with peers.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Contributing to your research community and supporting your peers</strong></p>\n<p>Contributing to the research community is an important element of your academic success, and social interaction is the most essential, pervasive, and persistent feature of a successful community. Therefore, it is very important that you integrate and stay in contact with your fellow doctoral candidates and academic researchers during your study period, as together the doctoral community, of which you are a part, provides a strong support network.</p>\n<p>To help candidates integrate with each other, a number of social events are arranged by the Doctoral Candidates’ Association at various points during induction weeks and at ad hoc times throughout the year. For example, the Annual DCA Conference is held during the April development week each year.</p>\n<p>The Graduate School also arranges a number of Graduate School Seminars and numerous PhD Assessed Seminars, and Prof Doc presentations, which take place throughout the year. These are in addition to the seminars and conferences that will be offered by your individual Divisions and Research Centres/Institutes.</p>\n<p><strong>All doctoral candidates are strongly encouraged to become active members of the University research community.</strong> This can be achieved in a number of ways but attending doctoral development weeks and internal seminars/conferences, and other similar events are the most obvious. Attendance and involvement openly show that you are supporting your peers, and this helps create a sense of belonging within your research community.</p>\n<p>The doctoral journey is a demanding one, and the value of peer support and being an active participant in your local research community should not be underestimated.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Dates for holidays should be agreed with the supervisory team in advance. All other doctoral candidates may take holidays at their own discretion, subject to meeting the usual requirements of study and any visa restrictions. However, holiday absences away from study should not normally exceed six weeks in any academic year. If you are in the UK on a Student Visa, please refer to Section A6 for more information on logging of authorised absence periods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a doctoral candidate, you are expected to take responsibility for your studies and academic progress, working in partnership with your supervisory team regarding your degree. In particular, this means that you should:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Supervision</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Work with your supervisors to establish and maintain the supervisory team working relationship. Once induction week is over, you will need to take some time to sit down with your supervisors and draw up a learning contract. The learning contract is an agreement between the candidate and their supervisory team. Both parties agree expectations, including how often they will meet and frequency of communication. Within the learning contract, you will agree, being guided by your supervisory team, the timescales for submitting written work to the team, and the timescales for them reading and providing feedback on written work. Another consideration will be how you communicate with each other, e.g. via email, face to face meetings, Skype, and/or some other method (s). Candidates may find it helpful to draw up a flexible timetable for milestone events throughout the duration of the research.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Whilst QMU regulations provide clear guidance and minimum standards for the management of supervision, there is flexibility to accommodate individual circumstances (for example the stage the candidate has reached) and preferences (for example format of meetings). The learning contract needs to be flexible to take these variations into account, in recognition of the individual nature of the doctoral candidate journey. The learning contract should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.</li>\n<li>Organise meetings with your supervisors. All candidates are responsible for maintaining regular contact with their supervisory team and organising formal meetings. Full-time candidates must be in contact with their supervisory team at least once every six weeks, and part-time candidates at least once every 12 weeks. Your formal meetings, which normally take place in person, should be planned well in advance, according to an agreed schedule, and timeframe (i.e. monthly). The frequency of meetings will often be greater at the beginning and end of the candidate’s programme. Informal or unscheduled meetings are also very important for the supervisory relationship. Informal meetings can happen in a number of ways, for example: face to face, by telephone or Skype, or in written formats such as email. If such meetings result in an agreed action point, or if important matters are discussed, the supervisory team and candidate should exchange emails afterwards to confirm the substantive points. It is expected that there will be regular email correspondence between meetings, and both candidate and supervisors should keep emails for future reference.</li>\n<li>Keep a log of your formal supervisory meetings. Candidates are required to keep a log of the dates they formally meet with supervisors, what is discussed, what work is to be carried out and any agreed deadlines. It is your responsibility to ensure that all meetings are logged and records kept. The format of the log will be decided by the candidate and the supervisory team, however, a template for a meeting log is included in Appendix 4 should you wish to use it. You and your team must agree to the content of the record and especially any action points and agreed deadlines3. The log should be shared by the candidate with the supervisors, and you each keep an agreed copy.</li>\n<li>Discuss any major concerns, issues or problems with your supervisors. Your supervisors will be happy to discuss your academic progress, as well as any pastoral matters, for example related to your health or other personal circumstances. Should you experience any difficulties with the supervisory relationship, you are encouraged, in the first instance, to raise these directly with your supervisors. Should you exceptionally wish to discuss an issue with an independent person, rather than with your supervisor(s), you should contact your Doctoral Research Coordinator for advice.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Academic</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Submit written work to your supervisor regularly and in good time, in accordance with the agreed timelines.</li>\n<li>Take note of any guidance and act upon feedback offered by the supervisors and marking team.</li>\n<li>Work together with your supervisors to ensure successful academic progression.

Retrospective suspension requests are not permitted unless there is a strong justifiable (usually medical) reason for not being able to have made a request for a suspension at the time it was required. Therefore it is important to be proactive in submitting your application.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%; height: 18px;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div

This is critical for the candidate, as it situates the learning within an appropriate and relevant environment. This issue should normally be discussed at interview prior to commencing the programme and it is the candidate’s responsibility to identify their own work-related context.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Registration and timescales</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Professional Doctorate can be completed within the timescales given in the table below.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Period</th>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Full-time</th>\n<th style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">Part-time</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Minimum timescale</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2 years (with a Masters degree4) 2.5 years (if abbreviated)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4 years (with a Masters degree) 5 years (if abbreviated)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Prescribed period</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3 years (36 months)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>6 years (72 months)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Maximum period (continuation year)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4 years (48 months)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.333333%;\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>8 years (96 months)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A full-time candidate should normally reach the standard for a Professional Doctorate within a prescribed period of study of three years and a part-time candidate within a prescribed period of six years.

In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All candidates must submit at least one piece of work for formal assessment per academic year; but may be working on several pieces at once.</li>\n<li>Candidates submitting work for assessment at SCQF Level 12 should informally submit work on a regular basis to their supervisory team for formative feedback to ensure the work is reaching doctoral level. Candidates must negotiate the timing of their formative submission with their supervisory team in advance to ensure enough time is allowed for due consideration of the work.</li>\n<li>When candidates are ready to formally submit work for assessment, there are three identified submission dates for candidates - one in December, one in March and one in June. This is to allow adequate time for double marking and external examiner review prior to the examination boards which are held in September and March. You may submit work at any time but note that you are not then guaranteed an 8 week marking process, therefore, you are strongly encouraged to aim for the published submission dates.</li>\n<li>A candidate may not fail more than 240 credits at Doctoral level. This allows you the opportunity to fail and retrieve each module once. Should you fail more than 240 cumulative credits you will be required to withdraw from the programme. This means that if you fail the first module twice, you will acquire 180 credits of fail. If you then went on to fail XD026 once, you would exceed the 240 cumulative credits and would be required to withdraw.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
