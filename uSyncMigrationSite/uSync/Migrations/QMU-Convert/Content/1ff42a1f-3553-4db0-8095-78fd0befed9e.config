<p><span class="lead">1.1 Background</span></p>
<p>Queen Margaret University (QMU) is committed to promoting sustainable and responsible travel behaviour through ongoing Travel Planning, Parking Management and the promotion of Active Travel. To constantly improve the conditions at QMU in terms of sustainable travel, annual monitoring of travel behaviour is undertaken to determine actual travel characteristics. This information is analysed, and the results are used to inform future targets and the appropriate allocation of resources.</p>
<p>Sweco were commissioned by QMU to undertake the 2018 travel survey for their campus in Musselburgh, East Lothian. The findings of the survey will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the Travel Plan, develop the Travel Plan further, and set future mode share targets.</p>
<p>The travel surveys are typically carried out annually at QMU; the 2018 survey was undertaken in January 2019. There will be reference to past travel survey results throughout this report.</p>

      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead-big\">2 Analysis of 2018 Travel survey</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.1 Survey Context</span></p>\n<p>Guidance was taken from previous travel surveys undertaken by Sweco for QMU in developing the 2018 survey. Early surveys were found to be too time consuming for participants, with some surveys consisting of up to 40 questions. To create a simpler and more effective survey for participants, in 2013 the Travel Survey was designed to contain 24 questions divided into general demographic and then 5 key themes based on modal choice. All 5 themes questions were presented, but respondents were advised they could skip those questions not relevant to them. Due to an increase in responses of almost 60% from 2012 to 2013, a similar format has been used in subsequent years, including the 2017 and now the 2018 survey.</p>\n<p>The survey ran for 3 weeks between the dates 15/01/2019 and 05/02/2019. There was an increased response from the previous year (370 responses), with a total of 469 respondents, which included a mix of students and staff.</p>\n<p>The survey was set up such that respondents answered general and demographic questions, they were then able to answer questions relevant to their chosen mode. Finally, participants had the opportunity to make any further comments and supply a staff ID or matriculation number for entry into a prize draw to win an Amazon Echo or Kindle Fire, which acted as an incentive to increase the number of survey responses. The relevant section topics are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General information and mode choice;</li>\n<li>Walking facilities;</li>\n<li>Cycling facilities;</li>\n<li>Local Train Services;</li>\n<li>Bus Services to QMU;</li>\n<li>The use of private vehicles and QMU’s car share scheme;</li>\n<li>Closing remarks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike previous years this year it was recognised that many use two modes of transport for commuting and we therefore included both a primary and secondary mode share option, so both of these could be considered. The questionnaire for 2018 can be found in Appendix A.</p>"

      "title": "Chapter 3 – Summary of the results from the 2018 Travel Survey",
      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead-big\">3. 2018 Travel Survey results</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.1 General results</span></p>\n<p>The survey was open to both staff and students with the split being roughly 3:1 students/staff, shown in Figure 1. 22.4% of staff and 9.1% of students responded, meaning that staff were more engaged representatively than students, however there was a good response from both. Examples of the “other” responses were from external staff and students mainly studying online.</p>\n<p>(Figure 1 - Split of staff to students completing the survey)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 1- Split of staff to students completing the survey\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.2 Time of Arrival/Departure</span></p>\n<p>Students and staff were asked at what times do they arrive and depart from the university. The results for arrival time was in keeping with last years survey. Figure 2 shows the most common time of arrival was between 8-9am, with 58% of participants choosing this option.</p>\n<p>(Figure 2 - Arrival time of respondents)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 2 - Arrival time of respondents\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>The departure time however was more varied and showed departures over a wider period. Figure 3 shows the most common time with 38% of people leaving was between 4:30-5pm. This varies from last year when the results were more evenly spread over a three-hour time period.</p>\n<p>(Figure 3 - Departure times of respondents)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 3 - Departure times of respondents\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.3 Mode share for 2018</span></p>\n<p>Students and staff members were asked both their primary and secondary modes of transport used to commute to travel to and from Queen Margaret University.</p>\n<p>The survey found that the majority of staff and students’ primary mode, with an overall combined percentage of 59%, travel to QMU using public transport. This year there has been additional promotion of sustainable travel to reduce the number of single occupancy car journeys. This has been reflected in the results with now only 19% of respondents making single occupancy journeys. Active travel options remain popular with the proportion of individuals traveling to the university by walking or cycling combined being 17%.</p>\n<p>The most significant positive change within these result is the single-occupancy car use. In 2017, 28% of respondent’s main travel mode was single occupancy car use meaning the percentage has dropped 9%. This change has resulted in an increase in people using public transport the combined figure for this rising from 44% to 59%. The change in habit may be due to more restrictions in car parking and the promotion of public transport. This year survey mode share results can been seen in Figure 4 with 2017 survey results for comparison.</p>\n<p>(Figure 4 - Comparison of 2017 and 2018 survey results for main mode of transport)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 4 - Comparison of 2017 and 2018 survey results for main mode of transport\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>This year we also have results for people’s secondary modes of transport. This shows public transport as the main option again with 63%. Short car journeys to railway stations are expected to make up the majority of the 13% single occupancy vehicles being used as a secondary mode of transport.</p>\n<p>Question 6 examines people motives for their travel choices. The main factor was journey time with 41% of people detailing this as their primary reason. Cost was the second most popular reason and the only other answer with a significant proportion response was “lack of alternatives” this sits at 16% and is assumed to most be attributed to people with long commutes needing to use their car. Results are shown in Figure 5.</p>\n<p>(Figure 5  - People's motives in choosing mode of transportation)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 5  - People's motives in choosing mode of transportation\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.4 Active Travel- Walking</span></p>\n<p>Those who indicated they walked to university were then asked the distance they walk to university. The majority, 63% specified they walked under 0.5 miles. This correlates with the response of motive being for speed as for short journeys, walking can often be the quickest option. Although this is a high percentage it is a significant drop from last years results, in which 89% of walking commutes were under ½ mile. The proportion of respondents walking over 2 miles has increased 8 fold. This increase demonstrates the move towards green travel and the successful promotion of sustainable travel throughout campus. Figure 6 shows these results.</p>\n<p>(Figure 6 - Distance walked during commute)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 6 - Distance walked during commute\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>Largely people felt safe walking to campus (90%). Those who didn’t feel safe were asked how we could improve the situation. Some example answers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cycling/Pedestrian path to Newcraighall needs widening at several points.</li>\n<li>More street lighting [is required] especially on the shortcut to Newcraighall<br />station.</li>\n<li>Awareness of East Lothian walking paths.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The path to Newcraighall station was raised several times. This path needs improvement to ensure its use. The improvement of lighting on paths as well as highlighting where the paths are, and their route could help promote more staff and students to commute by foot. This was highlighted in the 2017 travel survey and is an ongoing issue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Active Travel- Cycling</span></p>\n<p>The percentage of people cycling has remained steady with 5% using a bicycle for their primary mode of transport.</p>\n<p>Figure 7 shows respondents rating of QMUs cycling facilities. 95% of people thought QMU’s cycling facilities were either very good or good. This is similar to last years results (96%). There was an increase in responses of good and a decrease in very good. This is potentially due to a lack of awareness of the full facilities available. Examples of this were shown in question 11.</p>\n<p>(Figure 7 - Rating of QMU's cycling facilities)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 7 - Rating of QMU's cycling facilities\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>Question 11 asks respondents about the universities bike hire scheme, Cycling Connections. Only 5% had heard of the scheme but 32% indicated they hadn’t heard of it but would like to use it. This demonstrates the importance of promotion and advertising. Results are shown in Figure 8.</p>\n<p>(Figure 8 - Interest and awareness in QMU's bike hire scheme - Cycling Connections).</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 8 - Interest and awareness in QMU's bike hire scheme - Cycling Connections\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>36% of people also indicated they would consider a pay as you go cycle hire scheme.</p>\n<p>Question 13 was aimed at highlighting areas that need improvement for cyclists. The question allowed for multiple answers and gave the option to add comments for more detail and other suggestions. The request was for improvements in changing rooms (30%) and cycle paths to campus (31%) other areas for improvement were lockers and showering facilities. The free text responses focused on there not being enough space in the changing rooms, lockers or for drying. The need for the tool station to be fixed or for a bike pump to be available were frequently raised. The issue of a bike pump is again an issue with awareness as there are two available behind reception. Some other comments were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NCN1 west of QMU needs more lighting and grit.</li>\n<li>Tools for emergencies.</li>\n<li>E-bike hire.</li>\n<li>Access to the gym for changing and lockers.</li>\n<li>More safe cycle routes needed.</li>\n<li>Better maps of cycle routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The results from Questions 14 and 15 cannot be directly compared to those form the 2017 survey. Due to allowing a primary and secondary mode of transport to be selected this meant everyone was free to answer all questions. Out of the respondents that said they used a cycle path for at least some of their commute, 63% of these use a cycle path for majority of the journey. Question 15 showed 21% of staff and students hadn’t heard of Dr Bike and 9% had used the service.</p>\n<p>Question 16 was included to get some feedback about the impact of cycling. The question asked about how cycling impacted health and happiness and the responses were very positive, referencing feeling fresh starting the day and an overall greater sense of wellbeing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.5 Public Transport</span></p>\n<p><strong>Train</strong></p>\n<p>Figure 9 demonstrates there were a range of opinions on the most important factors to improve the train services. The stand out priority however was increasing frequency. 59% said this was the most important factor for them. This is a significant growth from last years results with 31% ranking this as the top issue. This growth could partially be due to timetable changes on routes going to and Musselburgh station. With an increasing number of staff and students traveling by train this is an important issue.</p>\n<p>(Figure 9 - Ranking of improvements that could be made to local train services)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 9 - Ranking of improvements that could be made to local train services\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>When asked if there was adequate space to add a bicycle on a train there was split response with 44% of respondents saying there was. This is a shift from last year’s survey in which 53% said there was. The decrease in perceived available space could be due to the rise in people using train services and overcrowding on the train. Figure 10 displays answer split.</p>\n<p>(Figure 10 - Adequate space for bicycle on trains)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 10 - Adequate space for bicycle on trains\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>Similar to last years survey 84% of people believe more services are required around 5pm or later.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.6 Bus</span></p>\n<p>Since the 2017 survey the T1 Tesco service has been removed. 2017s survey showed the majority used Lothian 45 whereas this year (2018) Lothian 30 has a much higher percentage of usage, shown in Figure 11. This may just be a new catchment of students or as a result of the T1 ceasing.</p>\n<p>(Figure 11 - Most frequent services used for QMU)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 11 - Most frequent services used for QMU\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>The following result, Figure 12, was received when asked what improvements could be made to bus services on campus. Similarly, to the train services increased frequency was the top issue shortly followed by tickets to be used on both trains and buses.</p>\n<p>(Figure 12 - Most important improvements for busses on campus)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 12 - Most important improvements for busses on campus\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>Other questions from this section showed that there was high demand for Lothian 45 to run a service on a Sunday (72% in favour). The N30 night bus was also shown to be used by 28%. These results are very similar to results shown in the 2017 survey.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.7 Car</span></p>\n<p>We have seen a great reduction in single occupancy car use on this years survey. Our first question tackles how we could reduce this further. Figure 13 shows the results that only 17% have no alternative or would not consider any alternative to driving in alone. This could be for a number of reasons, including commitments outside the workplace that may require them to have a car. 7.3% would not consider anything but travelling alone by car, this has dropped slightly from last years 10%. It is good that there is a steady decline in this number. For next years survey it would be useful to include a question to gain a better understanding of why people would only want to travel alone.</p>\n<p>Cheaper public transport stands out as the factor that could induce the biggest change. This is hard for us to influence but leaves us to promote free green travel.</p>\n<p>(Figure 13 - Factors to reduce single occupancy car trips)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 13 - Factors to reduce single occupancy car trips\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>As shown in Figure 13, 39% of people would consider car sharing, however a following question demonstrated 70% of people weren’t aware of QMUs Liftshare scheme. Liftshare will need to be further promoted and advertised around campus.</p>\n<p>Figure 14 shows the distribution of car parking for QMU. When the survey was initially carried out in 2010 63% of people used the QMU car park. This has dropped significantly to 37%. The trend continues from previous years with more people parking in the local area.</p>\n<p>This year there was a significant increase of respondents who parked in the station car park. There has been an increase of 10% from last years survey, with 17% of people parking in the station car park.</p>\n<p>(Figure 14 - Parking distribution)</p>\n<p><img src=\"?width=500&amp;height=296.551724137931\" alt=\"Figure 14 - Parking distribution\" width=\"500\" height=\"296.551724137931\" data-udi=\"umb://media/12b47abcda794cc1a6ed926479b90db0\" /></p>\n<p>We will continue to talk to Scotrail, East Lothian Council and the police to work towards a solution to reduce the improper usage of Musselburgh train station. The results may show a higher percentage of people using the rail station car park or the local area than before due to the survey set up. This time people were able to answer who don’t drive as their primary mode, therefore people who maybe only drive occasionally would respond to the question and be less likely to buy a permit, thus skewing the results slightly.</p>"

      "content": "<p><span class=\"lead-big\">5 Summary</span></p>\n<p>This report has reviewed the responses of 469 staff and students to the 2018 Travel Survey. There has been a significant improvement in availability and uptake in sustainable travel options. Over the past year the biggest result is the drop in single occupancy car journeys. The results show more can still be done to promote active travel modes. All questions and results are shown in Appendix B.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">5.1 Modal Split</span></p>\n<p>Modal split is subject to fluctuations especially due to the turnover of students. We have seen this year a large drop in single occupancy cars, producing the lowest percentage since monitoring began. Due to this the main modes of transport are now just bus and train. This is a very positive shift and we are optimistic for it to continue. It works with the objectives of the QMU Green Travel Plan 2016-2020 which aims to reduce single occupancy car journeys. The percentage of walkers remained level, but the number of cyclists dropped slightly from 9% to 5%. To further encourage active travel, the university will continue to promote its facilities and schemes and look for new ways to make cycling and walking attractive options.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">5.2 Future work</span></p>\n<p>Based on the 2018 survey results, the following points should be considered for 2019:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased awareness and promotion of cycling options and availability for QMU;</li>\n<li>Review of parking permit applications and pricing;</li>\n<li>Review of how to limit parking in restricted areas including the access road to Musselburgh station;</li>\n<li>Promotion of Liftshare and cheaper permit options for those that use it;</li>\n<li>More work to inform new students on travel options;</li>\n<li>Continued engagement with and promotion of the local public transport services; and</li>\n<li>A refreshed look into lighting on NCN1 towards Newcraighall station.</li>\n</ul>"
