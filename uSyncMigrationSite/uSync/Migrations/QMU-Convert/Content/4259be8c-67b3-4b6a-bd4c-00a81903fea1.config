<p>Queen Margaret University (QMU) is committed to providing students with a valuable and supportive learning experience. Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is already provided through the main institutional Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), Blackboard, also referred to as the Hub.</p>
<p>Lecture capture further enhances the capabilities of the existing VLE by giving lecturers the capacity to record, edit and enrich their live and pre-recorded content (often referred to as synchronous and asynchronous) and release it to students via the relevant module Hub sites.</p>
<p>In 2018, 75% of UK universities reported using lecture recording in some form.[1] COVID-19 has likely accelerated what was already an upward trend of lecture recording use across the sector. In June 2020, the Students’ Union (QMUSU) published the results to their student experience survey which highlighted the positive engagement students had with recorded lectures during the initial stages of the lockdown. This was emphasised by the corresponding data which showed that 63.7% of students want recorded lecture content provision to continue after pandemic restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>Lecture capture is normally a supplementary resource which is used to support learning and not as a substitute to replace live lectures. Research shows that lecture capture viewing fails to compensate for the impact that low attendance has on attainment.[3] Soong et al. (2006) also found that access to recorded lectures did not diminish students’ preference for face-to- face lectures.</p>

<p>There are several benefits of lecture capture for students:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Access to recorded lectures can lead to more positive results and learning behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will have more flexibility and control over their learning and gain the capacity to watch recorded lectures at a wider range of times, locations, and speeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students can use the recordings as a tool for revision ahead of exams and other assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It offers an alternative platform for students who are anxious about learning in live lectures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recorded lectures provide additional support to students who are non-native speakers of English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecture recording can assist with distance learning and help provide more parity in learning experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows students to view specific sections of recordings to reinforce their understanding of complex theories and concepts.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="lead">Lecture capture can also benefit staff:</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lecture capture can be used for self-reflection and evaluation, helping the lecturer to adapt pedagogy and/or improve communication skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving lecture content online can open-up more space for active learning during live sessions on campus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecture capture software offers a useful set of tools to enable the lecturer to produce more engaging and dynamic digital resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecturers gain access to user analytics. This enables the lecturer to see what and how often students are engaging with course content, thereby helping to gauge interest or areas of detachment.</p>

However, they may be used (with the permission of the lecturer) as evidence in such hearings. Management may also access recorded lectures where this is permitted in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act (e.g. for law enforcement purposes).</p>\n<p>The University will provide users with appropriate training and guidance in using the technology.</p>\n<p>If a member of staff has a disability which impacts on their use of the Lecture Capture technology, they are asked to discuss any reasonable adjustments with their line manager in the first instance.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Lecture capture will not be used to replace multiple teaching of large cohorts, or as a substitute for the availability of academic staff due to, e.g. industrial action.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Under normal operating conditions:</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Lecture Capture policy adopts an opt-in approach for staff. This means that staff have the choice to have their classes recorded or not. Staff who choose to record their class will be required to initiate the recording process.</p>\n<p>Control over access and use of recorded teaching material rests with the member of staff (refer to section 4 on performance rights).</p>\n<p>Lecture capture takes place only for events categorised in the timetable as lectures.</p>\n<p>As a minimum, audio and screen are captured, recording video is optional.</p>\n<p>Recorded content is available to students for two academic years, and archived for the lifetime of the module. This ensures a student has access to the recordings if re- sitting the module. It also enables staff who have recorded their lectures to access, use or repurpose their recordings in the subsequent academic session.</p>\n<p>Where lecture capture is implemented, students are clearly informed of the risks to their academic attainment of an over-reliance on the service as a substitute for lecture attendance.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Under extraordinary operating conditions:</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>If the Business Continuity Group or equivalent declares that extraordinary conditions exist, then these principles may be adapted to allow for appropriate adjustments to be made that ensure teaching provisions are met. Any adjustments made should be appropriate and proportionate to the prevailing conditions (e.g. the choice to opt-in may be removed if face to face on campus delivery of lecture materials is not possible) to ensure that teaching can take place:</p>\n<p>The opt-in approach may be temporarily removed in circumstances whereby it might impede the delivery of teaching e.g. where online teaching is the only option available.</p>\n<p>The range of events that are categorised as being appropriate for lecture capture may be broadened if the prevailing circumstances demand it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Guidance on what may be recorded (video/audio/screen) may be adapted where appropriate.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Content may be held for longer than two academic years, if the prevailing circumstances demand it. An important purpose of that retention is to enable staff who have recorded their lectures to access, use or repurpose their recordings in subsequent academic sessions.</p>\n<p>Advice to students on the proper use of the service should be appropriate to the prevailing circumstances.</p>\n<p>Any aspects of the policy that have been adapted due to extraordinary operating conditions are time limited; the Business Continuity Group must agree and announce an expiry date for any adapted policy articles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
