<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 1 - Read the information</strong></span></p>
<p>Applying for a student Visa can be complex. While we make every attempt to guide you through this process, it is very important that you read all the available information. If you have any queries or concerns about the published information please don't hesitate to contact us. <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk%20">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 2 - Accept your Unconditional offer </strong></span></p>
<p>In order to apply for a Visa to study in the UK you must have firmly accepted an Unconditional Offer from the University. In order for you to have an Unconditional Offer you must meet all the academic and non-academic conditions set by the University. You must normally send to us copies of your qualifications to satisfy us that you have met your academic conditions. Please refer to your offer letter for directions on how to meet the conditions of your offer, or accept your unconditional offer.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 3 - Tuition Fee Deposit or Letter of Sponsorship and Copy of Passport </strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Sponsored Students </strong></span></p>
<p>If your tuition fees are paid in full by a sponsoring body (this must be an official sponsor e.g. Government body) then you will not be required to pay the deposit.</p>
<p>In this case you should send us a letter from your sponsor confirming that they will be paying your tuition fees in full. Please note: Having a letter from your sponsor confirming payment of your fees does not guarantee that a Visa will be issued by the UKVI.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Self Funding Students</strong></span></p>
<p>We ask all new self funding students to pay a minimum of £5,000 deposit towards their tuition fee.</p>
<p>You should only pay this deposit once you have met the conditions of your offer and are holding an Unconditional Firm (UF) offer.  The tuition fee deposit will then be deducted from your tuition fees.</p>
<p>We will not issue you with a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies - CAS (which is required to apply for a Visa) until you have paid your deposit or have provided evidence that you are a sponsored student (see below) and provided us with a completed CAS Request Form and photocopy of your passport.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Paying your deposit by Credit or Debit Card </strong></span></p>
<p>The quickest and QMU’s preferred method of payment is by credit or debit card.</p>
<p>To pay by Credit or Debit card please call +00 44 131 474 0099 and ask to be transferred to our Finance team. Our telephone lines are open Monday to Thursday from 9am until 5pm and Friday 9am until 4:30pm.</p>
<p>When calling, please quote your full name; the name of the course you are applying to study on and your QMU Student number (this can be found on your offer letter). If someone else is paying your tuition fee deposit on your behalf, please ensure they also have the information requested above.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Paying your deposit by Bank Transfer </strong></span></p>
<p>If paying direct to our bank account please use the following bank details:</p>
<p><strong>Barclays Bank <br /></strong>120 Bothwell Street <br />GLASGOW<br />G2 7JT</p>
<p><strong>Name of Account </strong>QMU No. 1 Account <strong><br /></strong><strong>Account Number </strong>50858838<strong> <br />Sort Code </strong>20 33 70<strong> <br /></strong><strong>SWIFT Code </strong>BARCGB22 <strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>Please ensure your bank deducts all costs of the transfer from your bank account thus ensuring we receive the complete sum required. Please ensure to use your QMU Student number (this can be found on your offer letter) as a reference followed by your name if you do not know the invoice number.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Paying by Cheque or bank draft </strong></span></p>
<p>You can also pay by cheque or bank draft but this method can take up to two weeks to clear. Cheques must be in GB Pounds Sterling currency. Any cheques or bank drafts sent in any other currency will not be processed.</p>
<p>Your cheque or bank draft should be made payable to Queen Margaret University. Please also write on the reverse of the cheque, your full name and QMU Student number (this can be found on your offer letter). Your cheque or bank draft should then be sent to:</p>
<p>Finance Department, Queen Margaret University Queen Margaret University Drive Edinburgh, EH21 6UU</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>QMU Scholarships </strong></span></p>
<p>If you hold a QMU scholarship you will still need to pay the £5,000 deposit. The scholarship will give you a reduction in the fees but cannot be used to pay your deposit.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Refund of deposit </strong></span></p>
<p>The deposit of £5,000 is not normally refundable. Any request for a refund should be accompanied by supporting evidence such as your original Visa refusal letter and your IBAN or Swift number. Any refund will be subject to a £35 administration charge.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Deferring your studies </strong></span></p>
<p>If you would like to request a deferral of your studies after you have paid your deposit and after you have been issued with a Visa letter, your deposit will not be refunded but instead will be held by QMU until you recommence your application to study.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 4 - Complete the International Student CAS Request Form and send it to us with a copy of your passport </strong></span></p>
<p>Download the International Student CAS Request Form here. Save it to your computer and complete it fully. Return it to <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk%20">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> along with a copy of the information page of your passport.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 5 - Receive your Certificate of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) </strong></span></p>
<p>Once you have successfully completed all of the above steps, QMU will issue you with a Certificate of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) which is valid for a maximum of 6 months. This is a virtual document (a unique reference number) which is given to you to use when applying for your visa. The Certificate of Acceptance of Studies is worth 30 of the 40 points required by UKVI to obtain a Visa to study in the UK.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 6 - Apply for your Visa </strong></span></p>
<p>You cannot make a student visa application more than six months before the start of your course.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Maintenance Funds</strong></span></p>
<p>The remaining 10 points are gained from the Maintenance and Funds Test applied by the UKVI. To obtain these points, a student must show that they have held the funds outlined below in their own (or parents) bank account for at least 28 days, or have an official sponsor paying the funds. (Please note the end of that 28 day period must not be more than one month before the date of your application.)</p>
<p>The level of funds required is set by UKVI. For Universities outside of London, including QMU the funds required are:</p>
<p>From November 2015, for students where the length of the course is 9 months or less: the full course tuition fees outstanding plus £1,015 per month for each month of the course up to a maximum of 9 months.</p>
<p>From November 2015, for students where the length of the course is more than 9 months: the full first year of fees outstanding plus £9,135 to cover the first 9 months in the UK.</p>
<p>The level of tuition fees required to be shown will reflect any monies already paid to the University (e.g. tuition fee deposit).</p>
<p>Maintenance funds required to be shown can also be reduced if payment has been made to the University in advance for Student Accommodation in our Halls of Residence. The maximum deduction will be £1,265.</p>
<p>If you meet the above Maintenance and Funds criteria you will be awarded 10 points. This along with the 30 points obtained by having a Certificate of Acceptance of Studies from the University will mean you have met the 40 points required to get a Visa to enter the UK. Your application for a Visa will be refused unless you can achieve 40 points under the PBS.</p>
<p>Please also note that having a Certificate of Acceptance does not guarantee your visa application will be successful. You must meet all the requirements of the Student Route Visa category and any other requirement of the immigration rules set out at the UK Visas and Immigration website.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully obtained your Visa you should begin making travel arrangements for commencing your studies at QMU. Our Pre-Arrival Guide will provide you with information and guidance on making these arrangements, along with useful information and advice on the preparations you will need to undertake and the dates by which you should arrive at the University. <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/1620d7d2691f4195832b687d9f4c6394}" title="International Students" data-udi="umb://media/d79f626a17d846deba1a055873ef1517">Access the latest guide issued for international students. </a></p>]]></Value>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead"><strong>Please note</strong><strong> : You cannot make a student visa application more than six months before the start of your course. </strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Do I need a student visa? </strong></span></p>
<p>You will need to check with your local British Council, British Embassy, or the British High Commission if you require a visa to enter into the UK. Most students require at least entry clearance. They will be able to advise you on where to obtain a visa application form.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Points Based System </strong></span></p>
<p>This section aims to give you basic information on the requirements of the PBS including specific requirements set out by Queen Margaret University.</p>
<p>The Student Visa system is a Points Based System (PBS) and aims to clarify and make the process of visa application easier for students. The main section of the law that applies to students is Student Route Visas.</p>
<p>Under the PBS a total of 40 points are required before a student can apply for entry to study in the UK. For full details and to see the complete policy,<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration" target="_blank"> you should visit the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) website. </a></p>]]></Value>
