The defining feature, however, is that if the behaviour is offensive or intimidating to the recipient, and as such would be regarded as harassment by any reasonable person. It would need to be considered that, if the purpose of conduct was to violate the employee’s dignity or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment, then this is sufficient to establish harassment. However if harassment was not the purpose, but the employee argues this was the effect of the conduct, the Equality Act says that in deciding whether conduct has that effect, consideration must be given to:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>the perception of the claimant</li>\n<li>the other circumstances of the case, and</li>\n<li>whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have had that effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Forms of harassment involve offensive conduct or behaviour directed at a person’s racial origin, religion and beliefs (including non belief), gender, disabilities, sexual orientation, age, family status (including their role as a carer or as a part-time worker, fixed term worker), marital status, political opinion, socio-economic status, or because he/she are a member of a trade union or similar associations or some other personal characteristic. It can also include the inappropriate use, or threat of use, of physical and mental power, authority or through social media.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>With regard to religion and belief it should be noted that there may be cultural differences which make some forms of behaviour generally regarded as acceptable by one group and unacceptable to another because, such behaviour does not form part of the normal social interaction of that particular group.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Third Party Harassment</strong> occurs when an employee experiences harassment (due to a protected characteristic) by the action of a third party to the University (with a third party as a body who is not an employee of the University such as such as students, consultants).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em>See appendix 2 for examples of potential harassment.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>All Dignity at Work complaints should be raised as soon as possible through the Dignity at Work policy and procedure following the recent act of unacceptable behaviour. If a member of staff believe that they have experienced or witnessed discrimination, harassment or bullying, there are two procedures for raising such concerns about Dignity at Work: through an informal procedure or through a formal Dignity at Work complaint. Where appropriate, it is recommended that complainants use the informal stage of the Dignity at Work policy and procedure, in the first instance. Any employee who wishes to raise a complaint or concern related to Dignity at Work should do this within 3 months of the incident. This will enable the matter to be resolved swiftly and decisively. Only in exceptional circumstances, such as a period of prolonged absence, will a complaint be considered outside the timescale.</p>\n<p>Every effort should made for parties to aim to resolve issues informally in the first instance</p>\n<p>It is accepted that there may be instances where the nature of the complaint is too serious to be dealt with informally and it is necessary to undertake a formal investigation of the complaint. Formal proceedings may also be more appropriate where a previous attempt to an informal resolution has been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that if Human Resources, a line manager or Trade Union Representative are made aware of a situation which has caused(or could cause) harm to the complainant (or others), the matter must be reported to HR and action will be taken immediately, potentially bypassing the informal stage.</p>\n<p>Throughout the informal and formal process, the respondent has the same right as the complainant to contact HR, line manager or Trade Union Representative for guidance and support. The entitlement of the respondent to a fair hearing should not over-ride the provision for safety and duty of care for the complainant.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>The Informal Procedure</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In many cases issues may be resolved informally with no recourse to the formal procedure.</p>\n<p>The informal stage can apply where the complainant simply wants a behaviour, including an observed behaviour, to stop, or where the behaviour does not pose a serious threat to employee/s or where the behaviour is not of a kind which has been consistently repeated..</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>The informal stage aims to resolve issues by adopting a variety of approaches which may include</li>\n<li>A facilitated / accompanied meeting between complaint and respondent;</li>\n<li>Communication between complainant and respondent through a third party without face-to-face meeting;</li>\n<li>Mediation provided by a trained mediator;</li>\n<li>Modification of working patterns to avoid potential conflict situations;</li>\n<li>The opportunity for reconciliation through apology and agreement of standards of behaviour to be observed in the future;</li>\n<li>Agreement of review period for assessing changed behaviour;</li>\n<li>Involvement of line manager, where appropriate, to create a conducive atmosphere for better working relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Human Resources will facilitate and if required, attend any informal meetings. The aim of meeting is to make clear to the respondent that the complainant finds the behaviour unacceptable and should be stopped immediately . It is hoped that both parties will suggest ways in which the behaviour could be modified to become acceptable and mutual agreement can be reached.
