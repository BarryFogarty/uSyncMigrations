This ascertains your fitness for the programme of study and identifies any areas where adjustments may need to be made, such as the Equality Act etc.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is not an automated process, and each email must be generated manually so there may be a delay of some months between you accepting your offer and the email being issued from Cohort. Remember to check any ‘junk’ or ‘spam’ folders you may have.</p>\n<p>As a mandatory attachment to your questionnaire, you must obtain information, in English, regarding any vaccinations you have had to date. Your vaccination history (normally obtained from your GP/Child Health Record or Paediatrician) should provide evidence of your childhood immunisations, in particular evidence of having 2 doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>\n<p>Please obtain a copy of your immunisations from your GP or Occupational Health service, if you have had access to one other than NHS Lothian. If you are unable to provide copies of any vaccinations, please attach a word document explaining why you are unable to provide this.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that some GPs and/or medical centres may charge for this service and there may be a delay of some weeks in obtaining this information. Please ensure that you have this evidence <strong>before</strong> you submit your questionnaire. The university does not require sight of the information as it is confidential and should only be shared with Occupational Health.</p>\n<p><strong>You should ensure that the questionnaire, and supporting evidence, has been submitted prior to Induction Week.</strong></p>\n<p>No one is forced to undertake immunisations they do not wish to have, however, it may affect where we are able to send people on placement. Please note that you may be required to have a blood test/Mantoux test if you are unable to provide evidence of having a BCG vaccine.</p>\n<p>All students who are not SAAS funded, Scottish domiciled and on an undergraduate programme, will be required to pay for their immunisations and/or blood tests. The prices are set by Occupational Health and are available upon request, however, we are unable to advise on your specific requirements in advance of your first appointment. As a rough guide, the average student may expect to pay around £250 over the duration of their course for Occupational Health purposes. We do not want students to fall into financial difficulty regarding vaccination costs and we will facilitate helping with payment plans if required.</p>\n<p>All students must attend at least one 'in-person' 30-minute appointment on campus during the first semester, usually around Induction Week. The appointment(s) will be made for you by Occupational Health staff, and you will be notified of the date and time by email. If additional appointments are required, these will be booked directly with Occupational Health at each subsequent appointment.</p>\n<p>Should a student fail to attend any appointment, without giving Occupational Health at least 48 hours’ notice, they will be charged a £35 non-attendance fee, which will be invoiced by QMU.</p>\n<p>Occupational Health have produced a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/833585968/19ce57b610?share=copy\" data-anchor=\"?share=copy\">short video</a> containing additional information about the nature of the appointments and what you may be offered.</p>\n<p>If you have any queries regarding any of the information above, please contact <a href=\"mailto:HealthClearance@qmu.ac.uk\">Health Clearance</a>.</p>"
