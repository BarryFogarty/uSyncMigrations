In my teaching career I gained experience working with children, young people and adults. I have worked in both Scotland and Italy and have taught in primary and secondary settings. I have developed an expertise in working with learners with complex Additional Support Needs and with young people who experience a range of other barriers to learning. I have also taught nurture and supported adult refugees and asylum seekers learning English in community education settings.</p>\n<p>To date my research has focused predominantly on the subject of historical and contemporary migration to Scotland. I am interested in how Scotland has transitioned from being a country of emigration to a destination for migrants. I have most recently researched the experiences of young people who have survived trafficking living in Scotland. I have also examined the historical development of the city of Glasgow and its social and cultural influence internationally.</p>"

      "content": "<p>My research interests are largely centred around the subject of migration to Scotland. My PhD thesis examined how Glasgow Corporation, a local government, used existing systems of welfare as a model for the humanitarian assistance of Belgian refugees during the Great War. My research looked extensively at Glasgow’s urban history, considering the expansion of institutions and their role in addressing the city’s social problems. Moreover, it examined Glasgow’s historical and contemporary links to international humanitarian appeals and the extensive role the Catholic Church played in delivering relief.</p>\n<p>In addition to this I have also researched the subject of child trafficking in Scotland. I have considered how this subject has been understood as an issue which has been intrinsically linked to migration. I have examined the provision of services for survivors in Scotland and have investigated the short, medium and long term needs of young people who have experienced this issue living in Scotland using participatory research methods.</p>\n<p>Beyond this I have developed a specialism in archival research and have explored subjects such as the social-cultural history of Glasgow, the teaching of the First World War and how digital archives can be used to trace refugees.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Active research interests: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historical and Contemporary Migration</li>\n<li>Contemporary Scottish History</li>\n<li>Immigration and Children’s Rights</li>\n<li>Urban History</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research Methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historical and Archival Research</li>\n<li>Participatory Research</li>\n<li>Qualitative Research</li>\n<li>Using the Arts in Research</li>\n</ul>"
