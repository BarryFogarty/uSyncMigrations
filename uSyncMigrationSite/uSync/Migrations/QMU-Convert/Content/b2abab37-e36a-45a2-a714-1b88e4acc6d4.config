The Credit Controller will help you to draw up a payment schedule, to which you will be required to adhere until your fees are paid in full.</p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENT TO LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Unless you have agreed a payment schedule with the Credit Controller, if tuition fees are still outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21-day period or if an instalment is over 4 weeks late, you may be asked to leave the University. The University will put your debt into the hands of a debt collector.</p>\n<p class=\"txtHeadings\"><strong>REINSTATEMENT ON PAYMENT OF FULL TUITION FEES </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">On payment in full of outstanding tuition fees before the end of the academic year in question, the University may permit your reinstatement on your programme of study. However, if you are behind with your studies you may have to repeat parts of the programme, thereby incurring further fees.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">PROGRESSION</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">You will not be permitted to progress to the next year of your course if you have any debts due to the University from previous years.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">DEGREE CEREMONY </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">The University may refuse to allow you to attend a degree ceremony if tuition fees are outstanding.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">APPEAL PROCESS</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you are unhappy about a decision concerning payment of your fees, including a requirement that you withdraw from the University, you may contact the <a href=\"mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"email student funding\">Student Funding Adviser</a>, and bring a complaint under the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/2daf2cbf61f14b3da20fdeaa950818f4}\" title=\"Complaints Procedure\">University’s Student Complaint Procedure</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">EARLY WITHDRAWAL </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you leave your programme of study early, you must ensure that you inform your Head of Subject and the <a href=\"mailto:registry@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"email Registry\">Registry</a> department. The date of withdrawal will be deemed to be the date that the Registry department receives written confirmation of withdrawal. You will be liable for all or part of the fee for the full academic year as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you leave within 28 days of the start of your programme of study, you will be liable for an administration fee of £250.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you leave more than 28 days after the start of your programme of study, you will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee based on the semesters attended wholly or in part.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you are making payment of fees by instalments and withdraw from your programme of study, you must still meet any shortfall between the full fee determined by the University and the total amount of the instalments already paid.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you are experiencing financial difficulties in paying tuition fees you should seek help at the earliest possible opportunity. The University will be sympathetic and assist where it can. However, in order to maintain the quality of teaching for everyone else, the University must act to recover debts. Initially you should approach Bill Stronach, the <a data-id=\"1642\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/ad8fc076737d4365941e1ad4c0445c77}\" title=\"Student Funding Service\">Student Funding Adviser </a>within Student Services for a confidential discussion. You may also wish to speak to a personal tutor or someone at the Students’ Union for advice and support.</p>"
