      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why did you choose to study at Queen Margaret University (QMU)?</strong></p>
<p>The city of Edinburgh played a major role in attracting me to QMU, but mostly I was impressed with the level of commitment showed by the lecturers and support available to international students. QMU is very diverse, open, multicultural, and committed to education and research at the highest standard.  This is reflected in the University’s philosophy, vision, values and mission.</p>
<p><strong>What did you enjoy most about your course?</strong></p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the self-directed learning system which allowed me to direct my post-registration MSc in accordance with my professional needs, career orientation and personal aspirations. This was well supported by the excellent feedback and direction given by my personal academic tutor, lecturers and course coordinator. QMU also promotes various interdisciplinary learning opportunities and research initiatives, which proved excellent for networking, learning from various health professionals and getting an understanding of different points of view to clinical practice.</p>
<p><strong>What was one of the highlights about your time at QMU</strong></p>
<p>One day I was working in the GaitLab (QMU’s laboratory for clinical motion analysis) on my MSc dissertation and met a PhD student who was carrying out research in the field of podiatry. We ended up collaborating to design a custom insole product which we patented and commercialised. This multi-disciplinary collaboration has since developed into a partnership with various international projects. </p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice for international students interested in studying then working in the UK?</strong></p>
<p>After I finished my post-registration course at QMU it was challenging getting my first post in the NHS. However, after getting my first opportunity to work for the NHS, developing insight into the NHS framework/service delivery and gaining valuable clinical experience. I have been presented with good opportunities to progress my career and align my aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any tips for prospective international students interested in studying at QMU?</strong></p>
<p>Given my own experience, I would recommend that students with undergraduate physiotherapy qualifications apply for their Health Care Professions Council (HCPC) registration early, as it’s a lengthy procedure and can take few months to process for international students. This will save some valuable time when applying for physiotherapy jobs after you’ve finished studying.</p>]]></Value>
