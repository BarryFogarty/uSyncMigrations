The Service aims to help you become as self-reliant as possible as you progress through your degree programme here at QMU. You can arrange individual appointments with ELS to talk about academic skills queries, or for shorter queries you can come to one of the ELS drop-in sessions. The ELS also publishes a range of helpful resources at the website link above. The ELS is based in room 1153 in the LRC, and this is where on-campus appointments take place. The ELS also offer remote appointments and sessions.</p>\n<p>The best way to book an appointment with the ELS is through <a href=\"https://studentcentral.qmu.ac.uk/s/els\" title=\"Student Central\">Student Central</a></p>\n<p>For other queries, you can use the following email addresses<u>: </u><a href=\"mailto:els@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Email ELS\">els@qmu.ac.uk </a> or <a href=\"mailto:elsinternational@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Email ELS International\">elsinternational@qmu.ac.uk.</a></p>"

They offer a relaxed, fun and informal way to receive support for your learning at QMU. You can use a session either to help you understand something you were struggling with, or perhaps to consolidate and develop the learning you have already completed. We also run revision sessions so you can brush up on your knowledge in the run-up to your exams. The students who run PALS sessions are known as PALS Leaders and they have all been where you are now and want to support you by sharing their experience.</p>\n<p>PALS sessions run on a regular basis throughout term, and you will be notified by email, CANVAS announcements and your lecturers about upcoming sessions. Some sessions are also advertised on Student Central. The sessions are not mandatory – some people just pop along to a session when they have a particular area of study they are struggling with, while others attend every session because they appreciate the extra support and the experience of the PALS Leaders. </p>\n<p>If you would like to attend a PALS session, or you are interested in becoming a PALS Leader, you can contact the PALS Team at <a href=\"mailto:pals@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Email PALS Team\">pals@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>"
