      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong><span>Why did you choose to study at QMU? </span></strong> </p>
<p><span>In my final year at school, a student from QMU gave me a tour around the campus and its facilities. Instantly, I had a good feeling and it felt like everything I needed was right there on site, or just a short train ride away. I loved the welcoming and positive atmosphere I experienced the moment I set foot on campus. It definitely felt like a place I would enjoy studying, and with a keen interest in therapeutic radiography, and a good range of subjects offered within the course curriculum, it felt like the move to QMU was going to be full of possibilities. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What interested you about the Therapeutic Radiography course at QMU?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I have always been a kind and compassionate person, so therapeutic radiography fitted my personality well. I knew I would enjoy interacting with the patients, helping them through challenging periods of their lives, and I also knew that I wasn’t meant for a desk job as I prefer being on my feet throughout the working day. When looking into universities, the Masters of Therapeutic Radiography course at QMU was perfectly structured, especially from 2nd year onwards. A big part of the degree course was on-site work placements, so I knew I could learn the theory, and then apply it to practice, while picking up practical skills at the same time – something I was really keen on. I was also interested in combining my passion for physics with patient interactions and the care of others, using my skills for good – something that therapeutic radiography would provide me with. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What attr</span></strong><strong><span>acted you to study in Edinburgh? </span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I have family living in Edinburgh, so I visited the city frequently as a child. It’s lovely and I really liked the idea of studying in such a historic and beautiful place. I lived overseas in Africa for several years, and I was really keen to come back to Scotland. Edinburgh felt like a good fit, especially as I would have family close by. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been the highlight?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>The support from staff has been the best part about my course. They have really taken the time to get to know me on a personal level and have helped me get the most out of my time at university. They are always happy to help those who might be struggling with certain aspects of the course or finding the work challenging. They will often make time to have 1-2-1 sessions with students. It makes me feel like I’m not just a number on my course, which can sometimes be the case at bigger institutions - the staff really want what is best for ev</span><span>eryone. The lecturers provide a range of learning materials and guidance and are always willing to answer questions. They are also good at engaging the class and give us multiple small-group tasks for variety, and to help us learn to work as part of a team.</span> </p>
<p><span>I have also really enjoyed my modules as I have found it interesting to learn about all the different cancer sites. The topics have gradually become more complex over the years which I have loved as they have really got me thinking more critically. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Tell us about your placement</span></strong> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="I have spent 50% of my time on placement from 2nd year onwards in several departments in radiography around Scotland, including Dundee and Aberdeen. It has been really interesting and invaluable to see a range of approaches and methods when on placement, and to have the chance to put the concepts I learned at university into practice. QMU has a good relationship with the placement sites and works in partnership with them to help you build your skills and knowledge.  " source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p><strong><span>Have you been a part of any extracurricular programmes during your time at QMU? </span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I am part of the Student Ambassador team and I’m also a Class Representative. Both opportunities have helped improve my presentation and communication skills, especially as I had to learn how to give feedback in a constructive and polite way. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What QMU student services have you used to support you through your university journey and how have they helpe</span></strong><strong><span>d you? </span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I have used the disability service every year to get support for my dyslexia. I have also received help in so many ways from my personal academic tutor, especially with computer programmes, which has really helped me improve my academic performance and made my life much easier. Every time I have reached out for help, they have been friendly and responded super quickly. When comparing the support service here to what I have heard of other universities, it is way better, and you can get the help you need much faster.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Were there any activities that you particularly enjoyed when you started life at QMU?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>During Welcome Week, I went along to a Breakfast BBQ held at the Students’ Union and also went on an organised trip to North Berwick. I made a really good friend during that trip that I still have today, as well as having a really great day out in a new place. I still remember having some delicious ice cream and walking around the shops. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Are you a member o</span></strong><strong><span>f any clubs or societies at QMU? If so, what was the reason you joined and what do you e</span></strong><strong><span>njoy most about it?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I have been a member of a few clubs and societies at QMU. The most notable is the yoga. I’ve been a member of the yoga club for three years, and I’m now the treasurer. I joined because I really wanted to meet new people with similar interests. I wouldn’t have expected to see a yoga society at a university, but I love that there are so many niche options that really allow you to explore your interests and discover what you enjoy. My advice for other students would be to get involved in as many things as you can. It helps you meet as many new people as possible.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What are your plans after graduation? Tell us about your ambitions and where you see yourself in the future? </span></strong> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="I am planning to work as a therapeutic radiographer for the NHS when I graduate next year. Looking to the future, I’m not sure where I will be yet, but I’m sure it will be an exciting adventure.  " source="" sourceExtra="" />]]></Value>
