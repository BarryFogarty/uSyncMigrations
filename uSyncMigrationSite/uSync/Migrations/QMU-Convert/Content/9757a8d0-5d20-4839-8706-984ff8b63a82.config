      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead"><strong>1.0       Context</strong></span></p>
<p>At QMU our sense of community is paramount and our campus is the centre of what we do. </p>
<p>It is vital for our identity and the experience of those who work and study here that our shared sense of belonging and community is maintained, which includes staff and students collaborating in person.</p>
<p>All roles will require sufficient presence on campus throughout the year for various purposes, for example, face-to-face teaching; undertaking research; provision of professional advice and support to those attending or visiting on campus; collaboration; team building; attending meetings where there is a requirement to be physically present; and events. An important consideration should always be how the way in which roles are undertaken impacts on other colleagues’ ability to undertake their role.</p>
<p>Due to the restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, the University was required to adapt, with nearly all staff moving very quickly to working remotely. Our IT infrastructure has been enabled to support remote working for some time and this was utilised by staff, where appropriate, pre-pandemic. It is recognised that we now have greater experience of remote working, for which IT continues to be an enabler.  We wish to retain the positive aspects of remote working and achieve an appropriate balance of remote and on campus working as restrictions related to the pandemic are lifted. We note however that not all University processes or services can be provided remotely, which means not all employees will be able to benefit from this approach. We note too that not all employees will wish to utilise hybrid working. </p>
<p>The provisions set out in this document are intended to apply when there are no government restrictions or guidance affecting the ability to work normally on campus. It is acknowledged that some staff may be feeling anxious about a return to more on-campus working, and support is available. Staff members are encouraged to seek support by speaking with their line manager and/or HR Partner. Staff who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to coronavirus infection by medical advisers should seek guidance from HR and Health and Safety colleagues, or consult their trade union representative.</p>
<p>This document does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and it may be amended at any time.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>2.0       Definition of Hybrid Working</strong></span></p>
<p>At QMU we define hybrid working as an <strong>informal and variable</strong> working arrangement where, within agreed parameters, a member of staff works some of their time at home, or at another agreed remote location, and some of their time on campus. Patterns of hybrid work may vary from week to week and month to month in response to the variable nature of the work people will undertake over the course of any given year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>3.0       Flexible Working</strong></span></p>
<p>Hybrid Working is separate to the University’s  <a href="/footer/vacancies/hr-policies-and-procedures/working-arrangements-and-leave/flexible-working-policy/" title="Flexible Working Policy">Flexible Working Policy</a> which sets out how a staff member can formally apply for a change of hours, time or location of work, which, if agreed, has the effect of permanently changing the contract of employment (e.g. requesting a compressed working pattern, or requesting to work remotely on the same day every week). This type of request can be made under the University’s Flexible Working Policy.  Under this policy, formal flexible working arrangements may be agreed and put in place where a staff member needs a guaranteed commitment that they can work certain hours or days which differ from their existing contracted employment agreement.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>4.0       Benefits of Campus and Remote Working </strong></span></p>
<p>On campus working is beneficial for staff in many ways, including: facilitating face to face interaction with colleagues; establishing new links and contacts; establishing and building working relationships; learning from others; inspiring creativity amongst teams; and maintaining routine and structure in our working lives which we recognise is important for many in maintaining positive mental health.</p>
<p>Equally, the University recognises the potential benefits of staff working a proportion of their time remotely. It is also recognised that some work is particularly well suited to remote working. <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/fundamentals/relations/flexible-working/planning-hybrid-working" title="Hybrid Research CIPD">Research from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)</a> has found working in a hybrid way can have a number of potential benefits, including: a positive impact on staff wellbeing, morale and job satisfaction; increased capacity for attraction and retention of staff; increased organisational resilience; reduced commuting time and associated costs; more time for family and friends and potential opportunities to further optimise our use of existing space.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>5.0       Statement of Requirement and Supporting Principles</strong></span></p>
<p>The following statement of requirement and supporting principles underpin our approach to hybrid working and form the basis of agreed parameters under which some roles may be identified as suitable for hybrid working.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Statement of Requirement </strong></span></p>
<p>Our working arrangements must enable the University to deliver, effective, high quality services to students, staff, funders and other stakeholders.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Supporting principles</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Working arrangements will be adaptable in order to suit individual teams, departments and divisions, but will be in line with agreed University-wide policies and procedures, and will have regard to the expectations and requirements of students, staff from within and outwith the team concerned, and other stakeholders.</li>
<li>Our operating model will be trust- based, providing agreed flexibility for staff members to carry out their roles whilst ensuring the service delivery to our stakeholders is the priority.</li>
<li>Working arrangements will be underpinned by clear principles of equality, diversity and inclusion.</li>
<li>Working arrangements will enable and support staff wellbeing and a healthy work/life balance.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>6.0       Scope</strong></span></p>
<p>It is acknowledged that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic many staff, particularly academic staff, already worked in a hybrid way, in line with the University’s Working from Home Guidelines. The guidance in this statement regarding how staff may work in hybrid ways builds on existing flexible arrangements already in place.</p>
<p>Hybrid working is non-contractual, and the University campus remains the contractual ‘place of work’ for the majority of staff. As such, it is expected that employees will reside within the UK, and within a commutable distance of the University campus, unless their contract of employment states otherwise, or where the nature of their work requires overseas travel. </p>
<p>Staff should not be undertaking caring responsibilities whilst working remotely and must have adequate childcare arrangements in place. Staff are responsible for assessing their own childcare needs and ensuring that they are able to fully undertake their duties. Where a member of staff has temporary childcare issues they should refer to the University’s <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/c6d00707cea0431eb1c99dd5cb66678c}" title="Special Leave Policy">Special Leave Policy.</a></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>7.0       Eligibility for Hybrid Working </strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>7.1       Responsibilities for Decision Making </strong></span></p>
<p>Eligibility to work in a hybrid way is at the discretion of University management.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding how a service will be delivered, will be taken by the Dean/Head of Division (for academic staff) and Head of Department/Service (for professional services staff).</p>
<p>Responsibility for determining whether a role is eligible for hybrid working will be also taken by the Dean/Head of Division (for academic staff) and Head of Department/Service (for professional services staff). At this stage, the focus will be on the requirements of the role, not the individual preferences of the member of staff currently occupying the role.</p>
<p>Authority for managing the operational aspects of hybrid working, such as staff rotas to cover a service, may be delegated to line managers as considered appropriate.  At this stage, managers, in consultation with their staff members will consider the professional judgements of both staff and managers and the individual preferences of staff to work in a hybrid way as set out in section 8.</p>
<p>Where a staff member considers that their role has been categorised incorrectly they should raise their concerns with the person responsible for the decision in the first instance, setting out their reasons for disagreement.  If concerns remain unresolved they should be raised with HR.</p>
<p><span class="lead">  <strong>7.2     Hybrid Working Personas</strong></span></p>
<p>The following ‘personas’ have been developed to support managers in considering whether a role is eligible for hybrid working and, if so, to what degree.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>8.0       Agreeing Hybrid Working</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the service delivery model has been confirmed and, where applicable, roles have been identified as suitable for hybrid working</p>
<p>The manager will:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Consider how hybrid working will be implemented in practice within their respective team/division/department taking account of the Statement of Requirement and Supporting Principles outlined in section 5, and institutional guidance regarding any activities that will be conducted in person.</li>
<li>Liaise with HR and reflect on policy principles and associated guidance before entering into discussion with staff.</li>
<li>Communicate their expectations to staff in terms of how the team/division/department and/or service will function while adopting a hybrid working model.</li>
<li>Discuss the application of hybrid working with staff, considering their professional judgement and personal preferences, before reaching a final decision.</li>
<li>Confirm agreed hybrid working arrangements to staff.</li>
<li>Review and reflect on hybrid working arrangements throughout the year, providing staff with reasonable notice where a change is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The employee will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the most appropriate location for the delivery of their duties, including, where appropriate, from home.</li>
<li>Discuss their judgement and preferences for hybrid working with their manager.</li>
<li>Consider the needs of the University and their colleagues (both within their team and the wider University) and the professional judgement of managers when working in a hybrid way.</li>
<li>Work to an agreed hybrid working arrangement but remain flexible when it comes to its application and retain the availability and ability to work fully on campus if required and requested by their manager.</li>
<li>Keep their manager informed of any significant changes.</li>
<li>Ensure their Outlook calendar is up to date with details of whether they will be working on campus or remotely.</li>
<li>Proactively adapt their hybrid working arrangements in response to changes in the work they need to do.  </li>
<li>Raise any concerns with their manager at the earliest opportunity.</li>
<li>Seek advice from HR if concerns remain unresolved.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>9.0       Space, Expenses and Equipment for Hybrid Working </strong></span></p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the member of staff to ensure that, when not working on campus, they have a suitable environment in which to work. This should take into account health and safety, confidentiality and information security requirements. Guidance on work station set up at home is available from the <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/5c334dbad1fc4fd298200b477c4b3a79}" title="At Home">QMU@Home web page</a>.</p>
<p>Staff are responsible for ensuring that they have a good quality, secure and reliable internet connection when working remotely to enable them to carry out their duties.</p>
<p>The University will not make financial contributions for normal household expenditure such as heating, lighting and broadband costs. Remote working is optional, and staff may work fully on campus. The University will ensure that a suitable working environment is provided on campus.</p>
<p>Staff remain responsible for costs associated with travelling to and from their contractual place of work in all circumstances.</p>
<p>Electronic equipment is available on a loan basis to support hybrid working. The equipment provided and nature of the loan will vary according to role requirements.  The process for issuing equipment is managed centrally through The Helpdesk.</p>
<p>The University will not normally provide equipment for working remotely such as a desk or chair, except where equipment is required as part of a reasonable adjustment for disability. The University is not responsible for the provision, maintenance, replacement, or repair of any personal equipment.</p>
<p>Staff are expected to take reasonable care of equipment provided by the University for remote working purposes. As set out in contracts of employment, any equipment provided by the University must be returned if requested or if the staff member leaves the employment of the University.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>10.0     Mortgage, Lease and Insurance</strong></span></p>
<p>The University’s insurance policies provide cover for work property, and for any a claim by a third party in relation to any act carried out by a member of staff in the course of their employment with the University.</p>
<p>Employees are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advising their mortgage provider or landlord, and home insurer, that they intend to work from home.</li>
<li>Checking there is nothing in their mortgage agreement, lease or home insurance policy that prevents them from working from home.</li>
<li>Checking with their home insurer that they are covered if work equipment causes damage, and for any claim from a third party.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>11.0     Meetings </strong></span></p>
<p>It is expected that University Court, Senate and other formal institutional committees and standing (sub) committees will take place in person.</p>
<p>For all other meetings, the meeting Chair will decide the most appropriate location for the meeting to take place. It should be noted that while it may be desirable or convenient to have mixed mode meetings (in-person and online attendance combined) the preference is for meetings to adopt a single approach to optimise attendee engagement and experience.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>12.0     Equity and fairness </strong></span></p>
<p>Opportunities that arise (which may include but are not limited to, opportunities for professional development, committee membership, job progression etc.) should be openly and transparently communicated to ensure that all eligible staff are aware and are able to exercise informed choice. Staff must not be disadvantaged on the basis of their working arrangements, whether that is the combination of home and remote working, or through formal changes to their work pattern through the Flexible Working Policy.</p>
<p>The implementation of the provisions set out in this document will be subject to an Equality Impact Assessment.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>13.0     Further Guidance</strong></span></p>
<p>A Hybrid Working webpage [insert link] has been developed to provide managers and staff with further guidance on the application of hybrid working.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>14.0     Review</strong></span></p>
<p>The Statement on Hybrid Working will be subject to a review one year from the date of implementation.</p>
