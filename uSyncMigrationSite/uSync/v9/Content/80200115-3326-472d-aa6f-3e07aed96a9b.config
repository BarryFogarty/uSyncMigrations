Further guidance is available in the<a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/1e6713b4f34f412d89e603bd865ccdfc}\" title=\"Registration Regulations\"> Registration Regulations</a> (section 4).</p>\n<p>Students on Health Science programmes which require registration with a Professional Body such as the Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council (NMC) or the Health &amp; Care Professions Council (HCPC) also need to consider the registration period of the Professional Body. This may be shorter than the University registration period and if this is the case the Professional Body time period would apply. Students should be aware that in some cases there are no grounds for appeal relating to registration periods with Professional Bodies.</p>"

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Students can submit a request to defer their studies. This means leaving the programme and returning at a later date, normally the start of the next academic year. Deferrals must be approved by the Programme Leader and are normally granted for a maximum period of 12 months.  If you are a new student and have not yet matriculated, please contact the <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk" title="Email Admissions Team">Admissions Team</a> directly to request a deferral.</p>
