      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Yvonne, 26, who is from Larbert near Falkirk, was awarded the ‘Student of the Year’ title based on her academic commitment, evidence of progression and application of learning within the work environment.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">She also received a £100 cash prize in recognition of her academic excellence, which is sponsored by international hearing technology company, Starkey.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Yvonne completed the Diploma in Higher Education Hearing Aid Audiology at QMU this summer and has already kick started her career as a Hearing Aid Audiologist with hearing healthcare company, Amplifon, in Glasgow.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The Diploma in Higher Education Hearing Aid Audiology at QMU has equipped Yvonne with the skills required to deliver her graduate role, which includes carrying out a range of tests to assess customers’ hearing loss and providing up to date information from the leading manufacturers to offer the best hearing solution. She also carries out service, repairs and home visits for those clients who are no longer able to make it into the branch.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Commenting on her Student of the Year award, Yvonne, said: “I’m honoured to have received this award from Starkey and to be recognised for my academic achievement. I’ve loved my time at QMU studying for hearing aid audiology.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="“The QMU lecturers and staff have been extremely supportive. I came into this field as I wanted to help others like me with hearing problems. I now feel I’m on the path to achieving this." source="Yvonne Kelly" sourceExtra="" />
<p> </p>
<p>“My employer, Amplifon, has played a big part in helping me win this award. They have supported me throughout the two years, including giving me time to visit QMU for research and practical work.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Christine Johnson, Programme Leader for the Diploma in Higher Education Hearing Aid Audiology at QMU, said: “Yvonne was a very dedicated student, who strived to be the best she could be, even if it meant stepping outside her comfort zone. She was always willing to provide help and support to other students when needed.</p>
<p>“We’re confident that Yvonne’s success story will help inspire future Hearing aid Audiology students at QMU. We wish her every success in her future career.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Margaret Black from Starkey, which sponsored the award, added: "Starkey is delighted to sponsor this award once again. Yvonne has proved to be a worthy winner with her positive attitude and dedication to her studies at QMU."</p>]]></Value>
