<p>It is the Policy of Queen Margaret University to protect and promote, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of all its employees, students, visitors and others who may be affected by its activities in accordance with the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The University considers that good health and safety performance is a fundamental prerequisite if the University’s aims are to provide a first class working and teaching establishment.</p>
<p>In particular, it is the intention of the University where it is reasonably practicable to ensure:-</p>
<ul>
<li>The provision and maintenance of plant and systems of work which are, as far as is reasonably practicable, safe and free from risks to health by the careful identification, elimination or control of foreseeable hazards in the University Campus. This is seen as an essential part of offering quality education, training and research.</li>
<li>That safety is considered in planning all activities as well as in day-to-day work.</li>
<li>The provision of suitable information, instruction, training, equipment, safety devices and supervision to enable employees to perform their work safely and to understand the risks associated with their activities, the control measures in place and the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency or imminent danger.</li>
<li>The provision and maintenance of a safe, risk free working and learning environment, along with suitable welfare facilities.</li>
<li>That the University maintains a constant, continuing interest in all health and safety matters, and regularly consults with employees and students.</li>
