    "content": "<p>David’s research is concerned with two distinct, but interrelated areas of enquiry. The first focuses on relations of power and the production of value within the cultural sector. His current, AHRC funded project in partnership with Leeds University explores the absence of failure within the dominant narrative of cultural participation policies. Previous research has considered power relationships within the cultural sector, cultural participation, and cultural value. David’s second strand of research seeks to provide insight and understanding about the contingent and context dependent nature of organisational success in the arts and cultural sector. The dominant narrative about organisational management in this sector is often one of crisis, and yet there are numerous individuals and organisations that have achieved ‘success’ through effectively managing their resources relative to both the environmental context in which they work and the inherent risks of the cultural production they take part in.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Active Research Interests:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cultural policy, Cultural value, Cultural participation, Sustainability and resilience of subsidised arts organisations, Success and failure in the cultural sector, Participatory policy making, Relations of power in the cultural sector, Equality and diversity in cultural production and distribution</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Research Methods:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interpretative Policy Analysis, Discourse Analysis, Qualitative Content Analysis, Thematic Analysis, Qualitative Interviewing</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Doctoral Supervision: </span></p>\n<p>David is interested in supervising PhDs and Professional Doctorates related to Arts Management and/or Cultural Policy.

While believing that creative practice should not be managed, he is an advocate of the need for effective strategic management in the running of cultural organisations. As such, his teaching focuses on the knowledge and skills required by those who wish to ensure the continued availability of the spaces and resources in which cultural activity can take place. David has previously taught across a variety of modules including: Critical Issues in Cultural Policy, Strategic Management and Finance, Leadership, Governance and Strategy (not for profit), Experiential Learning, Evaluating Arts and Cultural Projects, Managing and Marketing Cultural Projects and Festivals, and Fundraising and Development.</p>"
