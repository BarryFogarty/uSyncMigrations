    "content": "<p>As a podiatrist you will be a healthcare professional who has been trained to diagnose and treat abnormal conditions of the feet and lower limbs. Podiatrists work with their patients to prevent and correct deformity, keeping people mobile and active, and helping to relieve pain. Podiatrists work with people of all ages, and your patients will count on you to support and help them with a broad range of mobility and medical conditions of the foot and lower limbs. These may include muscular and joint problems as well as broader health issues such as diabetes, blood disorders and disorders of the nervous system, which may involve complex wound management.</p>\n<p>The Year One modules include introductions to anatomy and physiology. You will be prepared for clinical practice by developing your communication skills and exploring the professional requirements to allow you to become a podiatrist and to work as part of a team. This will involve you developing key skills to allow you to begin your professional development journey as a podiatrist. In addition, you will reconsolidate existing research skills including essay writing and how to access information to support your learning. An early introduction to podiatry in the form of learning about clinical practice on placement provides the opportunity to allow you to integrate into the clinical environment. You will undertake modules that explore human walking and musculoskeletal problems. You will continue to broaden your understanding of health and wellbeing and how to influence and facilitate behaviour change. You will learn about medicine and pharmacology and the impact they can have on the lower limb. You will continue to develop your practical skills through further supported clinical placement.</p>\n<p>Year Two modules are designed to enhance your critical thinking, research skills and further develop your knowledge of foot and ankle imaging modalities. You will be broadening your healthcare awareness and challenging your understanding of health education and promotion, as well as developing your key skills in working as part of a multidisciplinary team. You will continue to link theory and practice during a range of clinical placement opportunities including advanced practice. Through a variety of placement opportunities you will enhance, consolidate and reflect on your theoretical learning to date. You will continue to develop your skills in research, professional development and current/advanced clinical skills enabling a smooth transition to working life. You will explore leadership skills and innovative practice to meet contemporary healthcare challenges in podiatry. You will complete your academic learning by undertaking appropriate and focused research activities.</p>\n<p>We aim for all our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member. This is the reason why we have implemented an interprofessional working focus within all of our healthcare courses, including this one.</p>"

There will be learning opportunities in the form of lectures, seminars, practical tutorials, online material, and practice based learning (clinical placements). There is a strong emphasis on student-directed learning.</p>\n<p>A variety of assessment methods are used including written assignments, practical viva exams, presentations and reflective writing assignments. Practice-based learning is a major component of the course, comprising of approximately 1,000 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are where your theoretical learning is consolidated and deepened by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will attend a variety of placements within the NHS at various locations and settings across Scotland. The programme team will assist with the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student on the course.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching hours and attendance each module is equivalent to a notional 200 hours of work (or multiple thereof), which is made up of attendance in class, online learning and independent work. The structure of each module is different with different attendance requirements for each timetabled module. Over an average semester the expectation is that during 14 weeks of teaching students will undertake approximately 40 hours per week of student effort, including contact classes, online learning and independent study time. Students will normally complete the course via a full-time route.</p>\n<p>All placements are completed on a full-time basis and in line with the requirements of the podiatry service, normally Monday to Friday, 9am–5pm.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by both our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/203122049774433189c10eb0b690917c}\" title=\"Master of Podiatry (MPod)\">Master of Podiatry (MPod)</a> and MSc Podiatry (Pre-Registration) courses. We have a large multipurpose clinical room, a large orthotics lab with a separate machine room, and a fully functioning surgical suite which are all used to facilitate student learning and our on-campus patient facing clinics. On-campus staff-supported clinics which we operate within the aforementioned spaces include: Nail surgery clinics, Nail surgery assessment and dressings clinics, and Musculoskeletal/Biomechanics clinics. We also provide simulated learning experiences within our clinical spaces to enable students to safely develop complex skills which can then be transferred into the practice education/clinical setting with patients. In addition, students will have access to additional laboratory based environments for specific teaching for Microbiology and Physiology, thus enabling us to contextualise complex theory into practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Normally there are 12 students enrolling on the course each year. Most of the classes are delivered with our undergraduate Master of Podiatry (MPod) students.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>"
