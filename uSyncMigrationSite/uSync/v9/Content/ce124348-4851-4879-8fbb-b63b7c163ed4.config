      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">Why QMU?</span><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You will learn from registered nutritionists and experts in the field who are actively researching some of the most interesting and influential topics in the field.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will build professional proficiency in our specialist labs, using advanced equipment and proven research techniques. </strong><strong>Our practical teaching facilities include specialist </strong><strong>microbiology, chemistry, food handling, and nutritional assessment laboratories.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The course is accredited by the Association for Nutrition (AfN) and on graduation you can register with the AfN as an associate nutritionist*.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Opportunity to study a semester abroad (subject to availability).</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will study at a university with wide ranging and widely recognised expertise in both health and in food science, that is home to the <a href="/research-and-knowledge-exchange/research-centres-institutes-and-knowledge-exchange-centres/scottish-centre-for-food-development-and-innovation/">Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation</a>. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this course you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn the academic principles behind food and gain practical skills in our advanced laboratories. </li>
<li>Learn how to think critically on a larger scale. What are the social, political, cultural and environmental factors affecting what we eat? How do nutritionists use evidence-based approaches to optimise health, prevent disease, and support behaviour change at an individual, community and population level?</li>
<li>Learn about the most current issues in the field of nutrition. For example, how does our gut microbiome composition impact our health? How do nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics influence current practice? What are the current / contemporary practices and policies in the field of nutrition</li>
</ul>
<p>Attracting increasing attention in recent years, nutrition is an engaging and rewarding subject to study and provides a pathway to a range of fulfilling careers. Nutritionists generate, assess, and deliver scientific and evidence-based advice in a variety of settings to improve health and wellbeing, and to promote a healthy diet and lifestyle. (See the ‘Careers’ section on this page for more information).</p>
<p>The science of nutrition employs evidence-based approaches to highlight the relationship between our diet and health, and it enables us to optimise health and prevent disease. The science of nutrition is concerned with how food affects the functioning of the living organism. It includes the study of food composition, how it is digested and absorbed, the production of energy, elimination of wastes and all the syntheses that are essential for growth, maintenance, and reproduction across the life cycle.</p>
<p>Our course gives you a great balance of theoretical and practical learning, preparing you for a wide range of career paths. You can opt to study for an honours degree over four years or an ordinary degree over three years. You will complete a range of modules each year as outlined.​​</p>
<p>*NB the ordinary degree does not lead to registration with the AfN upon graduation.</p>

Depending on the role, their work might range from creating, delivering and evaluating a range of practical and educational food-based policies and initiatives to encourage healthy lifestyle change, to providing nutritional information for food production and to secure approval for health claims on packaging. Nutritionists also provide specialist advice for preventing specific diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Type-2 diabetes and cancer, or they may provide advice on healthy eating to particular client groups (for example nutritional advice during pregnancy, infancy or older adulthood). Other areas of practice include, but are not limited to, working with athletes and sports teams, or working in the food sector, for example in quality management or nutritional analysis.</p>\n<p>Our graduates work across a number of sectors including government, academia, third-sector and private companies.
