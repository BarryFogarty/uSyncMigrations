<p>Once you have applied, you will receive an email from UCAS as confirmation that your application has been received. Following this, UCAS will provide a copy of your application to the universities that you have applied to.</p>
<p>Once we have received your application you will be sent a QMU Application Number. This is sometimes referred to as a Student ID.</p>
<p>This is an 8 digit number beginning with the final two numbers of the academic year that you have applied to. For example, applicants who are applying to study at QMU for the first time in September 2022 will usually have a student number beginning with the academic year in the following format: 22XXXXXX.</p>
<p>It is important that you make a note of this number and use it in any further communications with the Admissions Team so they help you with your queries.</p>]]></Value>
