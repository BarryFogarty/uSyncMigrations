    "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>This is a three-year ordinary degree. You will complete a range of modules each year as outlined.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will learn through face-to-face sessions and online. Learning and teaching approaches include lectures, seminars, practical laboratories and placements. We also use case based approaches, interactive learning, group work, simulation and games. Outside timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. Assessments will include practical work, written exams and assignments.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Practice-based learning forms a major portion of the paramedic course and there will be placement opportunities in each year.</p>\n<p>Clinical placements will provide the opportunity to integrate practice with theory by working directly with patients and qualified staff. This includes in care homes and settings providing care for ill adults, children and infants, emergency care, mental health, community and primary care.</p>\n<p>QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of full-time placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Placements take place across Edinburgh, the Lothians and Borders. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
