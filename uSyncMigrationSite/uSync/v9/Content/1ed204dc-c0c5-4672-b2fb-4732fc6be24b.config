They use a range of high-technology imaging equipment and techniques and work closely with a multidisciplinary team to provide a person-centred service.</p>\n<p>Radiography is invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and trauma. As a diagnostic radiographer your skill, judgement and professionalism will be a vital part of a team’s clinical work, and affect patients’ lives, day after day. Awaiting a diagnosis can be a stressful time for patients and in this career you must be technically adept, an excellent communicator and provide person-centred care. This is why our diagnostic radiography course places high importance on clinical placements. Placements are essential to build self-confidence, practice radiographic techniques and develop clinical knowledge in a real-life hospital setting.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn from staff with an outstanding reputation for the quality of teaching;</li>\n<li>gain all the knowledge and skills that you require to work as a diagnostic radiographer;</li>\n<li>develop your expertise through in-depth theoretical learning, clinical placements each year and the close support of our very experienced staff;</li>\n<li>benefit from the interprofessional working focus of this course.

    "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>During your first two years, you’ll join a diverse cohort of students, exploring the fundamental principles of diagnostic radiography and gain hands-on practice experience through placement-based learning within health and social care.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will move on to either the BSc (Hons) or the undergraduate master’s pathway depending on your aspirations and performance. Both pathways develop professional skills, knowledge and attributes through a combination of university and placement-based learning. The undergraduate master’s offer an opportunity to delve deeper into areas such as leadership, service improvement, research and public health, at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Upon graduation, both pathways lead to eligibility for registration with the HCPC, opening doors to a fulfilling career in diagnostic radiography</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\"><strong>Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical workshops. There will be a mix of classroom and online learning. Outwith timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of assessment methods (eg written practical and placement exams, written assignments, presentations and viva voce) at the end of each module. </p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will complete practice placements in each year. You will attend a variety of placements within the NHS and the private sector in various hospitals. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Placements take place across Scotland, it is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their placement-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern specialist spaces for use by our Master of Radiography: Diagnostic (MDRad)/BSc (Hons) Radiography: Diagnostic and MSc Diagnostic Radiography (Pre-Registration) courses. We have one dedicated diagnostic digital radiography room for practicing technical and professional skills, with fully functioning x-ray equipment. Our diagnostic radiography students also utilise QMU's clinical simulation suite, and physiotherapy and podiatry skills rooms which are equipped to simulate the real-life placement environment. Students have access to numerous anatomy models which are incorporated into their learning during practical sessions and can be used during self-directed study sessions.   </p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
