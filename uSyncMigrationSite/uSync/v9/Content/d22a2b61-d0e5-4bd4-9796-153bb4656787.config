<p>The values of Queen Margaret University (QMU) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>environmental sustainability: We recognise the severe threats to our environment and will be a sector leader in response.</li>
<li>the individual and encourage collective support: Each member of staffs and each student has their own journey to make and their own contribution to give.</li>
<li>intellectual curiosity and the journey of discovery: We design our teaching and research to facilitate this.</li>
<li>ambition: We inspire our students and employees to achieve the best that they can. We pursue opportunities, often in partnership and collaboration with others, to transform and influence society for the better and enhance our visibility within the higher education sector and the wider economy.</li>
<li>excellence: This is embedded in our research, teaching and learning, knowledge exchange and the services we provide.</li>
<li>Social justice: We embrace equality, diversity, inclusion, respect, and supporting our communities. Opportunities and access are open to all and on a fair basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Aims of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy</span></p>
<p>This Strategy is for all prospective and current students, staff, and contractors at Queen Margaret University (QMU) that aims to adopt an organisation-wide approach to making QMU a fairer and more inclusive place to work and to be part of, with inclusion and belonging at its heart.</p>
<p>We are proud of our diversity – on campus, online and as part of our history and global reach and influence. We are committed to providing an inclusive culture and to removing any barriers or institutional or structural social inequalities to success. We want this Strategy to be bold, innovative and agile and aim to embed it into <strong>all</strong> aspects of the QMU’s operations, and into the daily life and experiences of staff and students.</p>
<p>We are determined to meet and exceed our legal duty to eliminate discrimination in its different guises and to advance equality of opportunity and outcomes for all (see Appendix 1 for more detail on the legal and regulatory context).</p>
<p>We want to build and sustain a culture and organisation that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusive</li>
<li>Respectful</li>
<li>Enabling</li>
<li>Inspirational</li>
<li>Integrating</li>
<li>Self-reflective</li>
</ul>
<p>This new Strategy complements the suite of policies currently in force at the University. It represents a continuation of QMU’s EDI journey. It defines key EDI themes, our progress to date and our priorities for the future.</p>
<p>It is accompanied by an action plan which will set clear targets and milestones with named leads and key performance indicators. It should act as a rolling strategy with progress monitored on an annual basis, against the focal points. It has sufficient flexibility to respond to unexpected developments and / or events, and progress will be reported to relevant stakeholders (i.e.: students, staff, leadership team and University Court members).</p>]]></Value>
