<p> </p>
<p>In doing so, QMU is the first university in the UK to undertake such a broad review into EDI issues affecting both staff and students. This review was not commissioned as a response to any particular negative incident, but rather from a recognition that racism exists in society and that therefore our institution is not immune to it.</p>
<p>The work undertaken as part of this Review has included the completion of a series of facilitated consultations with staff and students across the University. Supporting the outcomes of the facilitated conversations, a detailed analysis of quantitative and qualitative data has been conducted. This has included analysing gender and minority ethnicity pay gap data and staff equality monitoring data, reviewing a sample of university policies, and developing and deploying a survey to students. Since its establishment, the Race Equality Steering Group has been consulted on the findings through quarterly meetings and has played an active and crucial role in the project.</p>
<p>The findings from this review have been set out in the final report, which can be accessed via the link below.</p>
<p><a href="/{localLink:umb://media/0fb2a301942f47728cfbd920dbfeeae7}" title="EDI Culture Review Report 2023"><span class="blue-btn">Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Culture Review Report</span></a></p>
<p>The findings within the report have informed an EDI and Anti-Racism Strategy, alongside a 5-year Action Plan, which we have already begun to implement across the University.</p>
<p><a href="/{localLink:umb://document/d22a2b61d0e54bd49796153bb4656787}" title="EDI Strategy 2023 - 2028" data-anchor="#"><span class="blue-btn">EDI Strategy for 2023-2028</span></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead-big">5-Year Action Plan</span></p>
<p>We find encouragement in the report’s findings that staff and students generally consider the University to be an inclusive environment. That being said, this granular review into our culture has identified a number of areas in which we can make improvements.</p>
<p>Covering a five-year span, the accompanying action plan, set out in the sections below, offers us a route to delivering meaningful, impactful actions to advance our current work on equality, diversity and inclusion, drawing on best practice, and building on actions that we have already implemented.</p>]]></Value>

<p>As part of our commitment to social justice, QMU is on a long and deep journey to advance equality, diversity and inclusion – within and beyond our institution. In 2021, we established the University’s Race Equality Steering Group with a remit to advance the institution’s commitment to race equality. This steering group commissioned an extensive and broad Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Culture Review, which was carried out in 2022-23, led by Professor Paul Miller and visiting fellows Dr Leroi Henry and Dr Kenisha Linton-Williams.</p>]]></Value>
