Investigating global health priorities from an interdisciplinary, biosocial perspective, her main scholarly interests broadly include: methods and ethics in health research; care practices; health seeking; and local understandings of health, illness, disease and public health interventions, particularly among fishing populations. Georgina’s PhD was based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork and epidemiological study exploring everyday realities of neglected diseases (schistosomiasis, Buruli ulcer and hepatitis) and their control among fishermen and women in northwestern Uganda.</p>\n<p>Before joining IGHD in 2019, Georgina was a Lecturer in Public Health at St George’s, University of London, and a Research Fellow in the Firoz Lalji Centre for Africa, London School of Economics, where she continues to collaborate on research projects as a Visiting Fellow.  </p>\n<p>Georgina has an undergraduate medical degree (MBChB) from the University of Birmingham, a Masters in Medical Anthropology from Brunel University and a PhD from the London School of Economics and Political Science (Department of International Development).
