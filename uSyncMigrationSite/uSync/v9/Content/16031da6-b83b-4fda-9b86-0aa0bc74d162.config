<p><span class="lead">CLASS REUNIONS</span></p>
<p>OUR ALUMNI OFTEN say that the friendships they made during their studies were the best part of their time<br />at QMU. This is why we love to hear when graduates have met up or our alumni team gets the opportunity to help organise a reunion.</p>
<p>Last September, we were delighted to host a special reunion on campus for former ‘Atholl Crescent’ students, marking 60 years of when they started their studies at the Edinburgh School of Domestic Science in 1963. The group of 16, who had travelled from across the UK, had great fun reconnecting with classmates and sharing memories.</p>
<p>They watched old film footage of Atholl Crescent premises, and explored other items from our archive collection, including their end-of year report cards!</p>
<p>Another ‘Atholl Crescent’ lifelong friendship was celebrated when Margaret Seabrook (nee Long) and Jessie Clarke (nee Lockton) recently reunited. The former home economics students first met when they joined Edinburgh College of Domestic Science in 1943.</p>
<p><span class="lead">REUNIONS: Call for Classmates</span></p>

<p>Fiona Bayne (nee Ramsay) is looking to contact graduates of the Diploma in Dietetics (and Catering), who started the course in 1974. Fiona would like to gather everyone together for a 50th reunion on Friday 4 October in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Carole Paterson, Lesley Williams (nee Stephen) and Liz MacIver (nee Logie) are organising a 40th reunion. They would love to hear from fellow students who joined the one-year course in 1984 and graduated with them in 1985.</p>

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p>OVER THE PAST year, the Development &amp; Alumni Team, and colleagues from our International Office, have<br />enjoyed meeting many QMU graduates at events, reunions and small catch-ups.</p>
<p>It was lovely to see alumni come together, and support the Class of 2023, at last year’s creative showcases held at the Traverse Theatre and Cameo Picture House in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>After a four-year hiatus, we were pleased to be back in London, and look forward to seeing everyone again this May.</p>
<p>We are very excited to have held our first ever alumni meet-up in Dublin, and are looking forward to visiting again soon.</p>]]></Value>
