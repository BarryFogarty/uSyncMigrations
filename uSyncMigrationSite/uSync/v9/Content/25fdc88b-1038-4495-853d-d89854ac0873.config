    "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Part 1: Postgraduate degrees and “direct” applications</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>1. Why is my course not showing on the application form?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Courses will only show on the application form search if they are available to apply for. So if the deadline has passed or the course is now full, it will not be available to apply to. Please see the individual course page for more information. Applications for the next academic year usually will open in October.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>2. What does Pre-registration and Post-registration mean?</strong></span></p>\n<p>A Pre-Registration course is a course that leads to professional registration in a particular setting. For example, with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) or the Health and Care Professional Council (HCPC). These postgraduate courses are designed for people who hold a degree in another subject who are looking to transfer their career into this specific area. They are often very popular courses with limited spaces and can be competitive to get into.</p>\n<p>Post-registration courses are designed for professionals who are already registered in their area to expand their skills and improve their CPD or academic qualifications to Master’s level study. In most cases you must already hold registration in this area.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>3. I don’t have all my documents, s</strong><strong>hould I submit an application?</strong></span></p>\n<p>While we can accept your application without all the required documents, we would not consider your application as “complete” until all of these are provided. If your course has a deadline and you do not have the required documents, we recommend that you submit your application anyway otherwise it will not be considered, however in most cases we recommend that you only submit once the application is complete. If you are currently studying a qualification, evidence can be provided once complete and Admissions would be able to issue a conditional offer in the meantime. </p>\n<p>If you have to provide further documents or we ask you to provide documents to be included with your application, we would normally expect these to be copies sent by e-mail. Ideally, please scan them and send through as a PDF or JPEG file no larger than 2MB. Alternatively, you can take a good-quality photo (with your phone for example) and we can include them as well.</p>\n<p>Please e-mail these through to <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Email QMU Admissions\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a>. You must include your student number, name and course title when you e-mail them to us.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>4. How do I apply for one module?</strong></span></p>\n<p><em>Associate (single) modules and Continuing Professional Development (CPD)</em></p>\n<p>While some of our CPD courses have direct applications, many of them are provided through a single (or “Associate”) module as part of a larger degree. So, we will ask you to apply for an “Associate module – MSc/MA degree title”. Many of the Person Centred Practice or Nursing courses are offered this way.</p>\n<p> As part of the application we will ask you to enter the module title that you are interested in in the last page of the application.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>5. What documents do I have to provide?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Some of our courses have very specific requirements, however the most common documents that we need to see are listed below.</p>\n<p><em>Academic Documents</em></p>\n<p>Please see <a rel=\"noopener\" data-id=\"12881\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/95ac4b2181744167be1beeccd5a48576}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"How to provide Certificates and Transcripts\">this page</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><em>References</em></p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a7f97e8bd7d2411fa8ffb23499b4da10}\" title=\"How to provide references\">this page</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><em>English language</em></p>\n<p>If you are not from an English speaking country (as recognised by <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tier-4-general-visa/knowledge-of-english\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Visit the UK Government website\">the UKVI list here</a>) we will need to see evidence of your ability to study</p>\n<p>The usual request is to see an English language test result, such as IELTS, TOEFL or Pearson. The minimum requirement for is usually overall IELTS equivalent score of 6.0 with no component less than 5.5 however many courses ask for more than this, so please check your individual course page for requirements. Every test must have been taken within two years of the course start date.</p>\n<p>If you have completed degree level studies in English language in countries not from this list, we may be able to accept this as evidence of your English language ability. You will need to provide a letter from your university stating that the degree was taught and assessed/examined in English. This is sometimes called a certificate of English proficiency. Under certain circumstances, such as if you require a CAS for a visa to study in the UK, we will also have to ask you to complete an interview over the phone. Any degree completed in English, must have been successfully completed within five years of the course start date.</p>\n<p>We may be able to consider other evidence of English language, so please get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Email QMU Admissions\">Admissions</a> to discuss. However, please note some of the courses we offer have professional registration requirements where this is not permitted and usually an IELTS test is the only evidence that can be accepted.</p>\n<p>More information on English language can be found on the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/faece53361e54baabf8a71adc02b4785}\" title=\"English Language Requirements\">International pages</a> of the website.</p>\n<p><em>Other documents we may need</em></p>\n<p><em>Criminal Record Check</em></p>\n<p>Applicants for certain courses of study must declare all criminal convictions at the point of application, and in these cases, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these courses will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent.</p>\n<p>In line with mandatory requirements for Scottish Universities, applicants to all courses must disclose relevant unspent criminal convictions and relevant live criminal procedures (charges) at the post-offer stage as well as annually on re-enrolment.  If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction or charge may have on their application, they must contact the Head of Admissions who will be able to advise accordingly. For more information on how we collect, store and use data relating to criminal convictions and charges please see our Privacy Notice for Prospective Students <a href=\"/about-the-university/qmu-student-privacy-statement/\" title=\"Privacy Statement\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The courses include: Person Centred Practice: Health Visiting, Person Centred Practice: District Nursing, Person Centred Practice: School Nursing, DipHE in Hearing Aid Audiology and the Aptitude Test in Hearing Aid Dispensing</p>\n<p><em>Evidence of name change</em></p>\n<p>If your degree or academic certificate is in another name than the one you have applied with, we will need to see evidence of your change of name, such as a marriage certificate or deed poll document.</p>\n<p><em>Translations </em></p>\n<p>Similarly to the degree certificate and transcript, if any of your documents are not in English, we must see an officially translated version of these documents before we can make an assessment. An official translation will include the signed and stamped details of the translator and cannot be provided as translated by yourself.</p>\n<p><em>Evidence of HCPC or NMC registration</em></p>\n<p>Some courses are offered for applicants who are already registered professional in their field. In these cases, we may ask for evidence of your HCPC or NMC registration.</p>\n<p><em>Collaborative courses</em></p>\n<p>If you are applying to QMU for a course that also run by a collaborative partner (such as NHS Lothian, NHS Fife or NHS Borders) please note! We do our best to ensure that copies of documents are handed to us from interviews, however some things do not passed across as quickly as needed. If you are asked to provide these documents by Admissions, please send copies to us directly.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>6. Now I have submitted my application, what happens next?</strong></span></p>\n<p>For our Undergraduate full time courses, applications are submitted via UCAS and you will receive a decision by the UCAS Reply by Date. Some of our courses (including MSc Physiotherapy and MSc Dietetics) have deadlines and your application will not be assessed until after this deadline. You should expect to receive a decision around one month after the deadline date.</p>\n<p>Many of our postgraduate courses (with or without deadlines) are assessed by the course tutors, so once Admissions have checked your documents we will pass your application across to them. Sometimes this can take some time, so we appreciate your patience while you wait. We aim to get back to applicants with a decision within 4 weeks of receiving a “completed” application. If you have applied for a course that holds interviews, this decision may be an invitation to attend an interview.</p>"
