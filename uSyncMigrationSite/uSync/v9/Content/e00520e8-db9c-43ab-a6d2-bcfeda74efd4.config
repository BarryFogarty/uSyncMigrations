<p>There is to be no differentiation between bank, agency, locum staff, health and social care students on placement to those on permanent contracts. This means that students on Clinical Placement within the NHS and associated care homes will be considered under the same category as staff. This also means that if you choose to be employed as agency and bank staff throughout your programme of study, you will be treated the same as staff.</p>
<p>If you choose to become contracted bank or agency staff, please ensure you have communicated with your manager to ensure you know how to book in for a vaccine appointment via phone or internet systems. <br /><br />Students on placement from universities or colleges into direct patient facing roles across the Health and Social Care environment will be provided with the booking details ahead of their placements.</p>
<p>NHS Lothian information was circulated to all Health Sciences students in January 2021, and should be accessed only by students with confirmed placements in NHS Lothian. Students on placements in other areas will be contacted directly, or should contact their Placement Co-ordinator for details of how to access vaccinations in other areas.</p>
<p>For students who receive 1st dose in one health board are and then on placement in another board area by the time their 2nd dose is due – there is a role for the new board to vaccinate, but also a role for the individual themselves to contact the new board staff vaccine to say they are approaching 12th week in advance. This should be done via your Practice Educator in the first instance. <br /><br />Should you have any enquiries, these should be directed to HealthClearance@qmu.ac.uk in the first instance, where the team will do their best to assist you. <br /><br /></p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Student Deployment Letter</p>
<p>To all pre-registration nursing, midwifery, allied health professional, medical, dental, healthcare science and dental therapy students, and HNC Care, Healthcare Practice and Occupational Therapy students.</p>
<p>27 January 2021<br /><br />Dear Student,</p>
<p>In response to the increasing pressures on the NHS and social care due to the Covid-19 pandemic during winter, we are writing to all healthcare students studying at university and college, to highlight an opportunity for you to apply to join the Bank of healthcare workers at your local NHS Board. We are highlighting this opportunity while wanting to continue to reassure you that we are very keen to support and protect your learning experiences and environment, and that your course, and your personal health and wellbeing are top priorities.</p>
<p><br />We know that many of you already work on the Bank, especially nursing and midwifery students, but for those of you who have not already done so, registering with the Bank may provide a variety of paid opportunities to support the NHS at this critical juncture. It does not provide a guarantee of work, but allows NHS Boards to offer you employment as and/or when the need arises in your local area. Once you are registered with the Bank some Boards may also offer you a part time fixed term contract at a maximum of 15 hours per week. The opportunities which are available will vary between Boards, depending on their current and future requirements.</p>
<p><br />You should only consider taking up this option if you feel you are able to work in addition to completing your studies. It is important that this opportunity does not impact detrimentally upon your course, or on your other personal circumstances. Your ability to take this up may also depend on varying demands of your course, and you should consider carefully what those are, and likely to be, before pursing this opportunity.</p>
<p><br />Please understand that this employment opportunity is completely optional. It is not part of the requirements of your studies and cannot be counted towards any practice hours that you are required to undertake for completion of your qualification. As a student you will be expected to continue to complete your university or college course, including attending clinical placements and other practice based learning opportunities.</p>
<p><br />With that in mind, it is your responsibility to ensure that any employment you decide to undertake:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>does not affect your studies, ensuring your progress on the course towards graduation;</li>
<li>is aligned to the employment guidance of your University/College course (there may be a maximum number of hours you can work); and</li>
<li>should not be in an area (for example ward or clinic) in which you are currently undertaking a placement.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Be assured that when you are in the health service, whether on a student placement, or working on the Bank, you will have access to the same resources as staff, including PPE and access to vaccinations and testing. You will be advised of the Board’s phone line or booking link to book yourself an appointment at staff vaccination clinics, if this is not arranged through your supervisor.</p>
<p><br />We know that some of you will be disappointed not to be embarking on ‘paid placements’ for the remainder of your studies. This is because we want you to continue on your programmes as normally as possible so that you become the health professionals that Scotland will need for the future. One of our top priorities is for you to be able to either graduate, or continue on, your degree programme. Therefore, protecting your learning experience and your status as ‘learners’ is as important to us and the future of the NHS, as it is for you.<br /><br />If you have any concerns about potentially working in healthcare frontline services, please contact your university personal tutor, who can discuss these with you, and direct you to appropriate supports. This includes your mental or physical health, or that of others around you.</p>
<p><br />Since the beginning of the pandemic healthcare students in Scotland have made invaluable contributions at an unprecedented time of need. Thank you all, whatever your role, for your extraordinary hard work, dedication, skills and commitment and for your continued efforts in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p><br />Stephen Lea-Ross<br />Deputy Director of Health Workforce, Leadership &amp; Service Reform</p>

This will be additional to your course hours, up to a maximum of 15 hours per week (or the hours prescribed as part of your University’s employment guidance).

If no name is provided, please review the HR section of the Website of the NHS Board, you would wish to work in.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Should I let my University know that I am applying to go onto the Bank?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should inform your programme leader or personal tutor if you plan to apply. They can help you to consider the balance between study and work, in your particular circumstances. However, there is no requirement to do this.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Will I be tested for COVID-19 when I go on placement?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Healthcare students are classed as key workers and are treated in the same way as healthcare staff.  Therefore, there is not a requirement for you to be tested prior to commencing practice learning experiences. When on practice learning experiences you have the same opportunities for testing as permanently employed NHS healthcare staff. Currently asymptomatic testing is not available for all healthcare staff. </p>\n<p>Since July, students on placement in oncology, elderly care and mental health wards with stays over three months, and students on placement in care homes, have been offered testing on a weekly basis - the same as the staff within these areas. Students are also offered testing when asymptomatic as part of incident or outbreak investigations at ward level when unexpected cases are identified.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Will I be vaccinated when I go on placement?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The letter emailed to you in December 2020 from the Chief Nursing Officer and the Chief Allied Health Professions Officer indicates that students will be vaccinated as the vaccine programme rolls out. This programme is now well underway and all students will be treated like staff when on placement and will be able to get vaccinated in practice. This was supported by a more specific guidance note circulated to all student on  22<sup>nd</sup> Jan 2021 (which appears on this web page).</p>\n<p>Students who are not going into practice experience now will be required to wait until they go on placement to be vaccinated.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Can I claim travel or accommodation expenses for my placement?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are a Scottish domiciled student on an undergraduate health care programme in Scotland, you can claim expenses for travel and/ or accommodation outside of the local area to you University, through SAAS.  No overseas travel or accommodation will be paid, and travel outside of Scotland has to be agreed by your programme lead before accepting the placement . Please follow the guidance on the SAAS website.  </p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Am I covered under the NHS Scotland Coronavirus Life Assurance Scheme?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>University students undertaking clinical placements in NHS Scotland are automatically covered under a temporary COVID-19 linked death in service cover called the NHS Scotland Coronavirus Life Assurance Scheme.

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The letter below (issued 28th January and also <a href="/media/10027/student-deployment-letter-27-january-2021.pdf">attached as a PDF</a>) invites all students on any healthcare programmes to consider working up to 15 hours a week as NHS Bank staff. This process is being managed by the NHS Boards and not by the University.</p>
<p>The FAQs attached to the letter  (also replicated below) give guidance on the process you can follow to be registered on the board. Sadly there are no specific details of the ‘local contact’ as outlined in the first FAQ. When we have the full list of contacts we will circulate this however in the meantime please review the HR information, in the Board you might consider working for, to seek clarity.</p>
<p>Your programme lead, placement co-ordinator or the School Office at QMU will not have the information on ‘local board contacts’, at this time.<br /><br />If you decide to join the bank staff rota you will be contributing to support the NHS workforce during the current pandemic, however I appreciate fully that this will not be the right way forward for everyone. Please remember that working should not interfere with your ongoing studies.</p>
<p>Best wishes and keep safe<br />Fiona<br /><br />Professor Fiona Coutts PhD MCSP<br />Dean, School of Health Sciences,<br />Queen Margaret University, <br />Edinburgh<br />EH21 6UU</p>
<p>Also on this page, you will find FAQs from the University, supplementary to those included in the letter from the Scottish Government. You will also find associated guidance issued by the University on 22 January.</p>]]></Value>
