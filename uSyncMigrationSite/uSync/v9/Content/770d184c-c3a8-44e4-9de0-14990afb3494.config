      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Led by Family Business United Scotland, the <strong><em>‘Family &amp; Business Strategy - Governance and Succession’</em></strong>event will provide an insight into how successful family firms understand how to benefit from the right resources to fulfil their plans, how business strategy and family strategy fit together, approaches to educating the next generation into the business, as well as different governance systems and how they impact the future of the business and the family.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The audience will include a wide network of family business owners, next generation family members, and non-family senior managers and directors within family firms.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Presenters and speakers will include Dr Claire Seaman (Reader in Enterprise and Family Business at QMU); Alastair Macphie (Chairman &amp; CEO of Macphie); Dr James Cunningham (Lecturer in management at Aberdeen Business School) and Sofia di Belmonte (Managing Director of award winning Punta Licosa Ltd).</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Paul Andrews, Managing Director of Family Business United Scotland (FBUS) explains more: “FBU Scotland was set up to champion the family business sector in Scotland, giving it a voice, creating a community of like-minded organisations to share ideas and network and to provide education that is not otherwise available. This event in association with QMU and Turcan Connell is the second in a series of educational events that have been designed to provide opportunities for Scottish family firms to learn from their peers, share insights and best practice and discuss topics that are of interest. This event is all about governance and succession, two of the key challenges that face family firms across the globe, not just in Scotland.</p>
<p>“Family businesses are the very essence of what Scotland is all about from the likes of household names such as Tunnocks, Arnold Clark, Macsween, Walkers and Baxters to the independently owner retailers and garden centres across the country. Collectively they represent the core of the Scottish economy, provide jobs, revenue and a real sense of community and FBU Scotland was created to give them the support and recognition that we believe they truly deserve.”</p>
<p>“Tom Craig, Chairman of the FBUS Advisory Board, added: “This is another major step in realising our vision of an Education Pathway designed for the special needs of family companies.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Dr Claire Seaman, Reader in Enterprise &amp; Family Business at QMU, said: “By supporting events like this, QMU is continuing to engage and work with Scotland’s SME and family business policy makers and practitioners to explore ways of improving the growth and sustainability of this vital sector.</p>
<p>“In Scotland, SMEs account for 99.3% of all private sector enterprises and 63% of these are family businesses. Our research suggests that family businesses are crying out for the right kind of support to help them succeed across the generations. If we want to change thinking and practice and improve business succession across these businesses, we need an integrated approach to learning, research and influencing policy.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Dr James Cunningham, Lecturer in management at Aberdeen Business School, said: “Small family businesses offer much to the Scottish economy; however they also make a critical contribution to society’s goals more generally. It is important that we consider sustainability in family businesses, if they are to continue to play a positive role in shaping the business environment.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Sofia di Belmonte, Managing Director Punta Licosa Ltd, added: “With over 200,000 family businesses in Scotland, many of which are SMEs, it is necessary that there is a forum where their voices are heard, and where experiences can be shared. The importance of the family business to the Scottish economy has been ignored for too long.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Tickets are ONLY available to family business owners, next generation family members, non-family senior managers and directors within family firms. Please note that this course is NOT available to professional advisers.</p>
