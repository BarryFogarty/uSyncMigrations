<ul>
<li><strong>This course offers a forward-looking, evidence-based approach to teacher training.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Our teaching degree is distinctive in its forward-looking focus on education in community settings, as well as in schools, and builds on our strong existing collaborations with local and national community organisations.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This is an intellectually inspiring course that is your first step on a rewarding career in education.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A curriculum and ethos suited to those with a social conscience who want to engage with socio-political issues and make a difference.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this course you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Develop the skills, confidence and passion to make a real difference in the lives of young learners as a teacher.</li>
<li>Study contemporary issues in education, psychology and sociology to develop a sound knowledge base of children’s developmental pathways and the range of factors that affect them.</li>
<li>Gain an understanding of how pedagogic theory and knowledge inform classroom practices at the early years and primary school levels.</li>
<li>Develop a detailed knowledge of all areas of the curriculum, including outdoor learning and become skilful at integrating literacy, numeracy and wellbeing throughout your teaching.  </li>
<li>Benefit from practical experience in educational and community settings, learning how to build positive relationships with children and work alongside other professionals.</li>
<li>Develop your academic literacies including digital and data literacy.</li>
<li>Develop research skills to enable you to develop as an autonomous, critically thinking, reflective professional.</li>
</ul>
<p>The course offers an approach to teaching that is founded in evidence-based research in the social sciences. If you want a career as a primary school teacher where you will genuinely make a difference in the world and inspire our future citizens, this course is for you.</p>
<p>This course is about more than simply preparing you to inspire a class of young learners; it will engage you in the wider socio-political issues that affect education on every level and how this in turn influences educational outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Our education courses draw on our expertise in, and focus on, wellbeing, resilience, child welfare and inequality. You will learn how to assess individual needs and plan inclusive learning experiences taking account of diversity and difference.</p>
<p>This is a fresh, modern and ambitious approach to teacher education. We hope you feel as passionate about this new direction as we do and look forward to receiving your application. At QMU we are committed to widening access to education and we welcome applications from all backgrounds and genders.</p>
<p>You will study for four years to become qualified to work as a primary school teacher. Progression into Year Two will be dependent on successfully completing all modules, placements and a reflective report in Year One. If, after the first year you decide not to pursue teaching there is an option to transfer to our <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/ce4e08ae149441b681e8f9cde2c45cea}" title="BA/BA (Hons) Education Studies"><strong>Education Studies</strong></a> course. This is a broad based social sciences degree with an emphasis on broader aspects of education.</p>
