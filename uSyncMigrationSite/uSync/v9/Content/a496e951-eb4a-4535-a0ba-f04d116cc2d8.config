<p>We have two train stations close to campus operating Scotrail services:</p>
<p>Musselburgh Station is directly outside the campus entrance and runs regular services into Edinburgh which takes around 6 minutes. </p>
<p>Newcraighall Park and Ride Station is a 15 minute walk away or a 20 minute journey on the number 30 bus.</p>
<p>The lines operating at these stations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The North Berwick Line (calling at Musselburgh Station)</li>
<li>The Newcraighall Line (calling at Newcraighall Park and Ride Station)</li>
</ul>
