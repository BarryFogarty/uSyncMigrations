      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Hmmm…this could be pretty expensive.</p>
<p>At first glance I am looking at paying for housing, a mandatory meal plan, flights there and back and I might want to leave my room when I’m there so I could do with some spending money.</p>
<p>I am however one of the many students that receives a student loan. I will be working from now until I leave, could I save some money up? Could I bank my holidays so I can receive some wages whilst away? As they say ‘Where there is a will there is a way”. I don’t know who ‘they’ are or if they have ever needed to shell out over two grand for housing but ‘they’ have a point. If I focus my mind to it and work out a budget for the coming months I should be able to afford it.</p>
<p>Keeping up regular communication with Laura from the RILO office I felt that throughout the process I was taken care of. This was extremely important having just started new Modules and a full time course of study.</p>
<p>It was during a recent meeting with Laura that the whole exchange became very real.</p>
<p>I have been lucky enough to have my housing cost covered by the University which has been a huge relief due to covering my mortgage whilst receiving unpaid time off from work.</p>
<p>Although the housing is now paid for I still have a lot of costs to cover.</p>
<p>Things got even better over a coffee one morning with Heather from the funding office, one quite Friday morning.</p>]]></Value>
