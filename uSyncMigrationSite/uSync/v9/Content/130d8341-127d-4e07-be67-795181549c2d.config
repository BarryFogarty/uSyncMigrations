      <Value><![CDATA[<p>In 2012, Sebastien decided to take a change in his career direction and applied to study BA (Hons) Media at QMU. He was attracted by the combination of theory and practice the course offered, which allowed him to develop his communications skills, knowledge of media and get a hands-on media production experience at the same time.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Sebastien was surprised to find the course offered him even more opportunities than he had expected. In his third year, he took part in QMU’s exchange programme at St Edward’s University in Texas, USA, where he specialised in digital media.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">In 2015, Sebastien was given the opportunity to exhibit his photography portfolio at QMU’s high profile TEDx event to inspire student and professional nurses.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">In his fourth year at QMU, Sebastien secured a paid marketing internship as part of the University’s Careers &amp; Employability team, where he found out about the QMU Employer Mentoring Programme. Sebastien was looking for professional guidance to help him develop his career prospects, so QMU’s Careers &amp; Employability team matched him with Joanna Miller, Marketing Campaign Officer at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh. Joanna gave Sebastien one-to-one mentoring advice and guidance on the theatre industry, arts and creative marketing, as well as career opportunities in the creative industries.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Commenting on his experience of the QMU Employer Mentoring Programme, Sebastien said: “The advice and experience I’ve gained from the QMU Employer Mentoring Programme has been an essential tool for my career development.</p>
<p>“Not only did it consolidate some of my skills, but it also gave me confidence – the confidence you really require when you set up your own creative business.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Sebastien’s mentor, Joanna Miller, Marketing Campaign Officer at the Festival Theatre and King's Theatres in Edinburgh, said, “I really enjoyed meeting with Sebastian and seeing his confidence grow. I haven’t been a mentor before and it was a lovely opportunity for me to chat to Sebastian about his plans for the future and see his film and photography business develop.</p>
<p>“I would be happy to take part in the programme again with another student who would like a career in the arts”.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">As well as graduating form QMU with a BA (Hons) Media in July 2016, Sebastien won QMU’s annual Media, Communication &amp; Performing Arts Photography Prize for his unique photography work.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Following his experience as part of the QMU Employer Mentoring Programme, Sebastien has now started up his own film and photography business, ‘Round Frames’, in partnership with fellow QMU graduate, Hong Anh Nguyen.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Round Frames is based within the Business Innovation Zone at QMU. The Business Innovation Zone supports students and new graduates in developing their ideas into sustainable businesses, thereby creating a culture of enterprise within the University.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Round Frames has already been commissioned by QMU to produce a promotional film that highlights student life in Edinburgh and surrounding area. </p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">For more information on Round Frames, contact Sebastien Regnier, T: 07838 178 407 or E: <a href="mailto:sebregnier@outlook.com" class="txtMainTextLinks">sebregnier@outlook.com</a></p>
