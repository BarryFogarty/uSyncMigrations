      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Lindsey is originally from Paisley but now lives in Edinburgh. Before coming to study at QMU, Lindsey studied music at the University of Glasgow and was a support worker for people with autism, as well as a music teacher for pre-school children in nurseries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a four year gap between Lindsey’s undergraduate and postgraduate studies, during which time, she took on a variety of projects within the third sector, some of which involved volunteering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to study MSc Music Therapy at QMU?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I wanted to pursue a career in music therapy and QMU is the only university in Scotland to offer this Masters pre-registration programme.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How are you finding the workload?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘The workload has been manageable so far but there is a large amount of independent study, so you need to get organised!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do you think the course is preparing you for your chosen career?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Unlike my undergraduate studies, I feel that the MSc Music Therapy at QMU prepares students for practical work, including work placements.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your top tips for future students?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be organised</li>
<li>Make connections in your chosen industry long before graduation</li>
<li>Appreciate the time you have to absorb yourself in a subject that interests you - this becomes harder once you are working!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are you working whilst studying at QMU?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m working as a part-time support worker with Trust Recruitment during the course. While I’m studying, I usually only work one or two days a week, working longer hours during university holidays in order to save money.”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What other work experience and personal development opportunities have you taken advantage of at QMU? </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>“I found out about the Santander Universities SME Internship Programme through one of the regular Moderator emails sent to all QMU students. I was successful in securing a 70-hour paid Volunteer Mapping internship with East Lothian-based third sector company, STRiVE (now rebranded to <a href="https://www.volunteereastlothian.org.uk/" title="Volunteer East Lothian">Volunteer East Lothian</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This opportunity has given me valuable third sector experience and volunteer mapping skills, as well as creating potential opportunities for future projects after I graduate from QMU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I thoroughly enjoyed meeting people in my new community and seeing trends appear as I analysed all the information I collected. The project has given me insight into volunteering structures in this area, as well as making me think more widely about the third sector, how it is funded and maintained and where opportunities can be found. I believe this will positively impact on how I chose to work and create opportunities in the future.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The results of Lindsey’s work have given the Volunteer Strategy Team an insight into how volunteers are coming together independently and running consistently in the local communities, including STRiVE, QMU, NHS Lothian, East Lothian Council and the Preston-Seton-Gosford Area Partnership. The results have also given a clear picture of how volunteering has changed over the last five to ten years, including how volunteer roles have become more demanding, and how important it is to have effective support systems in place to facilitate effective volunteering now, and in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hannah Axon from STRiVE, said: “Lindsey has been an absolute star- wonderful interpersonal skills and incredibly proactive. I’ve given her a couple of local music therapy contacts in the Third Sector. Lindsey is a great ambassador for QMU and Santander Universities and I’d certainly delighted to find more interns like her! “</p>
