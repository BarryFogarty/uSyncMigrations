<p><span>With face-to-face workshops delivered at the Queen Margaret University campus in Musselburgh both in the classroom and in our developing Outdoor Learning Hub, QMU’s focus is on giving teachers the skills they need to run their own workshops and creative classes and to think about outdoor spaces in a way that helps them integrate them into their day-to-day teaching practice.  This course focuses on aspects of leadership of drawing on experience of developing our outdoor spaces.</span> </p>
<p><span>Students on the new short course will benefit from </span><span>15 hours of face-to-face workshops </span><span>and 15 hours of online lectures, debates and seminars. Learning will combine interactive face-to-face education supported by both synchronous and a-synchronous online resources. </span> </p>
<p><span>The course will be taught by experienced outdoor learning professionals including QMU lecturer, Patrick Boxall, a lecturer in initial teaching and the project leader for the QMU Outdoor Learning Hub, and educational leaders, practitioners and architects.</span> </p>
<p><span>At the end of the three-month course, students will be able to plan and deliver a small-scale project for Outdoor Learning, identify the different ways in which an existing site can be used or adapted for Outdoor Learning, understand the key pedagogies that underpin Outdoor Learning and communicate these ideas with expertise.</span> </p>
<p><span>Students will be graded on their proposal for a place for Outdoor Learning they developed over the course. Helping relate the course to their own circumstances and prepare them to take the skills they have developed and apply them to their own teaching experiences.</span> </p>

<p><span>Danny Hunter, Principal Architect at Architecture and Design Scotland commented: “The new Outdoor Learning Hub will create a centre for local and national engagement in outdoor learning practice, leadership, and professional development.</span> </p>
<p><span>It will equip current and future teachers, community educators and volunteer leaders with the knowledge and skillset to confidently use outdoor spaces and places to enhance the learner journey of young people across Scotland.”</span> </p>
