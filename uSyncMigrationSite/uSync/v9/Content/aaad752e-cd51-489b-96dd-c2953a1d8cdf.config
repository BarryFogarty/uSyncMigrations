      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This innovative master’s course will help you gain a better understanding of the complex role that food plays in shaping our lives and the world around us.</p>
<p>The MSc Gastronomy takes a multidisciplinary approach to examining and better understanding how food works in our world. Many other food-related studies, whether in health sciences, hospitality, agriculture, marketing or social sciences, approach food from a particular angle. Our MSc Gastronomy course recognises that none of these specialities operate independently, and that the inter-connected nature of food is one of its most important, and most over-looked, characteristics.</p>

    "content": "<ul>\n<li>The course is an opportunity to engage in the multidisciplinary study of food.</li>\n<li>Unique in the UK, the course explores how food touches and influences all parts of our lives, examining the multiple and varied roles food plays in the complex interconnections between culture and communication, systems and science, production and politics, environment and ethics, and more.</li>\n<li>The tutors aim, where practicable, to make the course as varied and experiential as possible, using field trips and visiting speakers to explore food from a wide range of angles and viewpoints.</li>\n<li>Students gain invaluable insight into the many different ways that food shapes the world around us, as well as examining how a better understanding of food can help to address not just food-related problems, but many of the world’s most pressing social, public health, environmental and economic issues.</li>\n<li>The course builds on QMU’s history as an innovative provider of food-related courses and is continues to break new ground in this fast-developing field. After studying this inspirational and transformational course, we promise that you’ll ‘never eat the same again!’</li>\n<li>This is not a cookery course. Building on the definition of gastronomy as ‘the study of all things concerning the nourishment of humankind’, students are exposed to a wide range of topics and debates from fields as diverse as anthropology and sociology, history and culture, media and communications, physiology and microbiology, economics and geopolitics, agriculture and fisheries, sustainability and environment, ethics and philosophy, public policy and public health, and more. Understanding how all of these topics and issues are linked and influence each other is the basis of the ‘gastronomic’ approach</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p>It is increasingly recognised that reductionist approaches to tackling food-related issues are ineffective and that a more comprehensive and holistic approach is required if we are to understand the many ways that food influences our lives, and effectively address the many injustices and inequalities that are manifest in the food system. This programme takes an engaged, critical and broad-ranging approach to examining the many ways that food ‘nourishes’ us, how it shapes who we are, and how it can be used as a tool for positive social and environmental purposes.</p>\n<p>Your studies will be brought to life with seminars and case studies, and, where possible, field trips to farms, factories, food producers and other food system spaces and actors.</p>\n<p>Through input from specialist and expert speakers, you will gain exposure to the diverse influences that affect how we produce, process, consider, represent, practice and consume food. Scotland is often the showcase for this, but we retain a global outlook and the concepts covered are transferable to other cultures and countries.</p>"
