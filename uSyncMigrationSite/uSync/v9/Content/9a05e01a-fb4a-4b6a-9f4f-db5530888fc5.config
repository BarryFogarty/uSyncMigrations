    "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>All students enroll onto the honours degree, but you can choose to exit with an ordinary degree after three years.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment.</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars and in practical workshops. You will be assessed in a wide array of ways across the course, including presentations, case studies, podcasts, blogs, videos, essays, video essays and some written exams.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement </strong></p>\n<p>You will complete a four-week or 150-hour placement either in the summer vacation between Years Three and Four or in Year Four alongside other modules. Students are responsible for sourcing a placement host organisation and this can be in the UK or abroad. To help with the process, we hold a speed interview event to match hosts offering placements with students. The placement is unpaid although some hosts pay a wage and others cover travel and subsistence. We are able to help students find placements in many sectors including theatre, festivals, local and national charities, Scottish Government, and film companies, as well as marketing agencies. We keep in touch with our former students and many are keen to support our placement scheme having benefitted from this themselves while they were studying with us.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilities </strong></p>\n<p>We have superb on-campus resources, and media production equipment, including a recently-upgraded film editing suite and dedicated production and photography area equipped with a green screen and on-site lighting equipment, plus a fully equipped studio theatre and construction workshop.</p>\n<p>Our students have access to a wealth of cameras, audio recording equipment and other related filmmaking equipment for both their studies, and extra-curricular pursuits. This includes access to Adobe’s Creative suite of programmes, including Premiere Pro, Photoshop, After Effects and Audition.*</p>\n<p>*subject to availability and agreement with our technician staff.</p>\n<p>You will have access to our on-campus Business Gateway and <a href=\"/services-for-business-and-industry/business-innovation-zone/\"><strong>Business Innovation Zone (BIZ)</strong></a> that together provide business incubation spaces for student-led or graduate-led start-up companies and offer: desk space, a QMU business address, meeting facilities, ad-hoc rehearsal space and editing facilities, Business Gateway support and advice, a profile for your company on the QMU website, support with marketing materials and access to entrepreneurial networks within QMU and other universities (including Enterprise Campus, Scottish Institute for Enterprise, Sporting Chance and Converge Challenge).</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>Studying abroad through our exchange programme can be one of the most exciting and rewarding challenges for a student to experience. The opportunity to travel and live in another country, learn different customs and traditions, meet new people and future career draws many students into the exchange programme. In Year Three you have the opportunity (subject to availability) to study for one semester at a university overseas. Please visit the <a href=\"/study-here/international-students/exchanges-and-study-abroad/\"><strong>Exchanges and Study Abroad</strong></a> pages for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">This BA (Hons) Creative and Cultural Industries course will give you the expertise to succeed in a wide variety of careers. You will learn about the creative and cultural industries landscape and develop the critical thinking and content creation skills that will set you up for a career in the exciting and thriving creative and cultural sectors.</span></p>
<p>Creativity and culture play a vital role in our daily lives. Each day we engage in, or with, creativity and culture in some regard – uploading content to social media, going to the theatre, watching a TV show, attending a festival, or visiting a museum or gallery. Somewhere, at some point, a team of people conceived, produced, managed, and shared that creativity for us to experience. These people work in the creative and cultural industries.</p>
<p>This course will encourage you to think critically about creativity and culture – what it is, and how, when, where and why it is produced and consumed. It will provide you with an in-depth understanding of the creative and cultural sectors and how they are shaped by other factors – such as technology, economics, cultural shifts, and crisis. With creative production and industry engagement intrinsic to the course, it will provide you with the industry networks and knowledge and practical creative production skills you need to become one of the creative leaders and producers of the future.</p>
<p>NB This course is subject to validation, and the course content on this page will be updated after validation.</p>]]></Value>
