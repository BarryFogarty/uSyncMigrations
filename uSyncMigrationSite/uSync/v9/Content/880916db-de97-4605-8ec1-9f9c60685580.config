    "content": "<p>Attracting increasing attention in recent years, nutrition is an engaging and rewarding subject to study, offering a pathway to a range of diverse and gratifying careers. Nutritionists generate, assess, and deliver scientific and evidence-based advice across a variety of settings to improve health and wellbeing, and to promote a healthy diet and lifestyle.</p>\n<p>On this course you will learn the scientific and social importance of nutrition in a modern and forward-looking university with excellent specialist facilities and equipment. Integrated real-world experiences, including a work-based placement module will foster your practical skills. </p>\n<p>The science of nutrition employs evidence-based approaches to highlight the intricate relationship between our diet and health at an individual and population level, with consideration of biological, social, cultural, economic, environmental, and behavioural contexts. This scientific discipline delves into the impact of food on the functioning of the living organism, offering insights to optimise health and mitigate the risk of disease. Nutrition encompasses the study of food composition, digestion and absorption processes, energy metabolism, elimination of wastes, and the vital synthesis essential for growth, maintenance, and reproduction across the life-course.</p>\n<p>The course covers all three areas of nutrition specialisation (clinical nutrition, public health nutrition, and sports and exercise nutrition), so students can explore their specific interests and career aspirations. There is strong focus on sustainability with a new module dedicated to sustainable food systems. The new Nutrition Communication module (master’s route only) will foster your public engagement and content creation skills.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn the academic principles of the nutrition sciences and gain practical skills in our advanced laboratories;</li>\n<li>learn how to think critically on a larger scale. What are the social, political, cultural and environmental factors affecting what we eat? How do nutritionists use evidence-based approaches to optimise health, prevent disease, and support behaviour change at an individual, community and population level?; and</li>\n<li>learn about the most current issues in the field of nutrition. For example, how does our gut microbiome composition impact our health? How do nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics influence current practice? What are the current/contemporary practices and policies in the field of nutrition?</li>\n</ul>"

Both pathways develop professional skills, knowledge and attributes through a combination of university and placement-based learning. The undergraduate master’s offer an opportunity to delve deeper into areas such as leadership, service improvement, research and public health, at a higher level.  </p>\n<p>Upon graduation, both pathways lead to eligibility for registration with the AfN as an associate nutritionist.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">The benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching is organised across two semesters each year. You will learn through face-to-face or online lectures, seminars, practical workshops, self-study packs and our well-equipped specialist laboratories, including microbiology, chemistry, food handling, performance and exercise, and nutritional assessment laboratories. Outside these timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of methods (for example: written and practical exams, case studies, written assignments and presentations) at the end of each module or semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Practical learning in real-world environments is the perfect way to consolidate your skills. In Year Three, you will undertake a compulsory nutrition placement in a setting of your choice and with the support of your tutors, through the placement module. This can be in a variety of settings such as schools, government agencies, public health organisations, community groups, laboratories, private practices, sports teams, care homes, or food and drink companies. This module has been organised to allow students to undertake their placements overseas if they wish to do so. The placement module is a great practical experience, providing students with an opportunity to network within their profession, and to enhance their employability.</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>In Years Two you have the opportunity to study for one semester at a university overseas*. This opportunity is also available in Year Three for those pursuing the BSc (Hons) route only*.

Nutritionists may choose to work in areas of public health nutrition, clinical nutrition, sport and exercise nutrition, academia and research, food development and consultancy, private nutrition practice, and coaching.</p>\n<p>For example, nutritionists may work within community settings or local authority public health teams with a focus on health promotion and policy. Depending on the role, their work might range from creating, delivering, and evaluating a range of practical and educational food-based policies and initiatives to encourage healthy lifestyle change, to providing nutritional information for food production, and to secure approval for health claims on packaging. Nutritionists also provide specialist advice for preventing specific diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Type-2 diabetes and cancer, or they may provide advice on healthy eating practices to particular client groups (for example nutritional advice during pregnancy, infancy or older adulthood). Other areas of practice include, but are not limited to, working with athletes and sports teams, or working in the food sector, for example in quality management or nutritional analysis.</p>\n<p>Our graduates work across a number of sectors including government, NHS, academia, third-sector and private companies.
