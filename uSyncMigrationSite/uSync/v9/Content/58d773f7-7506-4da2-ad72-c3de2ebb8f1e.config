    "title": "3. Privacy",
    "content": "<p>It should be noted that systems staff, who have appropriate privileges, have the ability, which is occasionally required, to access all files, including electronic mail files, stored on a computer which they manage. It is also occasionally necessary to intercept network traffic. In such circumstances, appropriately privileged staff will take all reasonable steps to ensure the privacy of service users. The University fully reserves the right to monitor e-mail, telephone and any other electronically-mediated communications, whether stored or in transit, in line with its rights under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Reasons for such monitoring may include the need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ensure operational effectiveness of services</li>\n<li>prevent a breach of the law, this policy, or other University policy</li>\n<li>investigate a suspected breach of the law, this policy, or other University policy</li>\n<li>monitor standards</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access to staff files, including electronic mail files, will not normally be given to another member of staff, unless authorised by the appropriate line manager, Head of IT Services, or nominee, who will use their discretion, in consultation with a senior officer of the University, if appropriate. In such circumstances, the Head of Division, or more senior line manager, will be informed and will normally be consulted prior to action being taken. Such access will normally only be granted in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where a breach of the law or a serious breach of this or another University policy is suspected</li>\n<li>when a documented and lawful request from a law enforcement agency such as the police or security services has been received</li>\n<li>on request from the relevant Head of Division, where the managers or co-workers of the individual require access to e-mail messages or files, which are records of a University activity and the individual is unable, e.g. through absence, to provide them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The University sees student privacy as desirable but not as an absolute right, hence students should not expect to hold or pass information, which they would not wish to be seen by members of staff responsible for their academic work. In addition to when a breach of the law or of this policy is suspected, or when a documented and lawful request from a law enforcement agency such as the police or security services has been received, systems staff are also authorised to release the contents of a student's files, including electronic mail files, when required to by any member of staff who has a direct academic work-based reason for requiring such access.</p>\n<p>After a student or member of staff leaves the University, files which are left behind on any computer system owned by the University, including servers and including electronic mail files, will be considered to be the property of the University. When leaving the University, staff should make arrangements to transfer to colleagues any e-mail or other computer-based information held under their account, as this will be closed on their departure.</p>"

Make sure you know and respect their requirements on how you use their computers.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Know the rules</span></p>\n<p>External organisations may have very different attitudes in the use of ICT. It is important, therefore, when you go out on a placement that you make it a priority to familiarise yourself with the local regulations. Before you go out on your placement, your academic supervisor will try to ensure that you get a copy of the organisation’s specific ICT usage regulations. When you get onsite, it is worthwhile going over these regulations with your placement supervisor. This will help you get a better understanding of what is permitted and what is not. You may also find it helpful to make contact with the local ICT support department or helpdesk. The staff there will be able to give you more help and advice.</p>\n<p>Remember – all organisations have different regulations about what you can and cannot do with their ICT facilities. You must respect these when you are out on placement. It is your individual responsibility to familiarise yourself with the local regulations and to ensure that you do not abuse the ICT facilities offered to you when you are on placement. Any computer facilities offered to you whilst on placement will be provided for University work only, i.e. for use in learning, teaching and pursuit of studies. You must not abuse these facilities for any other purpose, e.g. to play computer games, for excessive social use of email, or for recreational internet use.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Keeping safe</span></p>\n<p>If you are a Health Sciences student, your research will require internet searches based on anatomical words and phrases. This may generate unwanted links to pornographic or other objectionable websites. To be safe, read the site summary carefully before clicking on a link. If you are not sure, do not click through! Where possible, you should use specific health science related search engines.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">What you should do if something unexpected happens</span></p>\n<p>Even if you are careful, you may accidentally access internet sites you did not mean to. This might happen because you clicked on a misleading link, you clicked on a link by accident, or because a site has been ‘hijacked’. You may also find that you get bombarded by unsolicited and explicit ‘popup’ advertising. If any of these things happens whilst you are out on placement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take a note of the URL (web address) of the site and the time you accessed it</li>\n<li>Tell someone immediately. If possible, show them what happened.</li>\n<li>If you are working in a public area, you may want to ‘lock’ the PC before fetching help. (You can do this by pressing the CTRL-ALT-DEL keys at the same time, then clicking on Lock Computer. If you cannot lock the PC, then make sure you have the details of the site you accessed, then log off.)</li>\n<li>Tell your placement supervisor as soon as possible</li>\n<li>Tell local ICT staff (any alerts regarding inappropriate internet use will go to them first)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tell your QMU supervisor to advise them of what has happened</p>\n<p>There may be an investigation into your online activities, but if the accident was legitimate and these steps are followed, it will be resolved quickly.</p>"
