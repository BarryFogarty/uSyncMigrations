<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Our teaching draws upon a vast experience and legacy of successfully preparing students for entry into the field of professional performance - there are QMU graduates in most of the major theatre and performance institutions in Scotland, and, of course, many have gone on to successful careers further afield.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Just a six-minute train ride from the centre of Edinburgh, we are well placed for easy access to the year-round performance opportunities that the Festival City provides, and our students often use the festivals as springboards for their own careers.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>We are ranked in the top 12 amongst UK universities for Drama and Dance (Guardian University Guide 2023).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this course you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop your knowledge of the field of performance and be equipped with the practical skills that are essential for developing a career in this sector.</li>
<li>Experience a tailored route to a degree level qualification.</li>
<li>Learn through physical exploration of the subject.</li>
<li>Experience a combination of learning and teaching methods including workshops, lectures, seminars, tutorials, case studies, demonstrations, simulation exercises, embedded skills training, field trips and projects.</li>
<li>Gain valuable placement experience through our growing links with external stakeholders. Examples of placement opportunities range from the Edinburgh International Festival to working with independent theatre companies or the Brunton or Lyceum theatres as well as a range of local primary and secondary schools. The mix of student placements is very diverse and we aim to accommodate all student aspirations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Focusing on the breadth of forms that performance can take, the course will be of interest to those who wish to explore the potential of performance beyond the conventional modes and spaces with which it is most traditionally associated.</p>
<p>You can opt to study for an ordinary degree, completing one year of this course or an honours degree, completing two. You will complete a range of modules each year as outlined below.</p>]]></Value>

The teaching team recognises that student-to-student interaction can be a highly effective learning activity and use various forms of group work, problem-solving groups, case based learning and project production teams, to enable this.</p>\n<p>Peer teaching is enabled through the use of seminar presentations, postings of individual and group research processes on the Hub and/or PebblePad, and collaborative devising or workshop generation processes. Students are encouraged to be enquiring, critical and innovative. Emphasis is placed on analytical, divergent ways of thinking. In addition to their own independent learning, students also initiate and lead individual tutorials/workshops with members of staff related to coursework or dissertation supervision. </p>"

In some parts of Scotland there is little youth theatre, little offer of drama within secondary education and limited access to professional theatre performances.<br />• Qualifications demonstrating the ability to engage in sustained, systematic study even if this is not within the standard entry requirements (see below for the recognition of prior learning).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applications for entry with general advanced standing (ie credit for previous study) are referred to the University’s Recognition of Prior Learning Panel.
