    "content": "<p>Dietitians have the opportunity to work in a diverse range of settings including health and social care settings, private practice, the food industry, research related roles and government advisory roles. There are many strands of knowledge that you will master on your way to a career as a dietitian. This course has been carefully structured to integrate theoretical study in different fields with the practical experience to develop the skills required to work as a graduate dietitian.</p>\n<p>In Year One you will study a range of modules that provide you with the fundamental knowledge, principles and concepts that underpin the practice of dietetics. You will be introduced to the role of the dietitian, the role of food in health, human physiology, genetics and biochemistry. You will develop skills in communication, information technology and academic study skills. Students are invited to begin to engage in our peer-mentoring scheme, which provides additional support during the transition to university life.</p>\n<p>In Year Two you will continue to develop your academic study skills and further develop your knowledge and understanding of the concepts relating to health and nutrition, when beginning to integrate biological and social sciences. You will undertake your first practice placement block. This will consist of two weeks on campus and two weeks within a Scottish health and social care setting.</p>\n<p>Year Three develops your knowledge and communication skills further, begins to have a more applied focus and is more clinically orientated. This helps to prepare you for your second practice placement block (12 weeks duration) within various health and social care sectors across Scotland.</p>\n<p>Year Four provides you with an opportunity to reflect on and consolidate what you have learnt on your placement at the end of Year Three. It allows you to undertake an individual research-based project to develop your knowledge and skills in this area. You will undertake your third and final placement block (12 weeks duration) within various health and social care sectors across Scotland.</p>"

Placements are randomly allocated to students as part of a Scottish wide allocation process.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employablity placements take place across a variety of health and social care settings in any of the Health Board areas across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location. The additional costs associated with placement travel and accommodation are the responsibility of the student. Students who receive SAAS funding may be able to claim for some of these expenses to be reimbursed.</p>"
