      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk business. When you study for a degree in business management at QMU you’ll gain a deep understanding of the nature and core functions of businesses. How do successful companies manage their resources? What’s the best way to make an organisation environmentally sustainable? What marks out a successful entrepreneur?</p>
<p>You can study a general business management degree or (after two years of general study) decide to focus your learning on the enterprise, finance  marketing elements of business management or analytics. </p>
<p>​How do businesses generate meaningful reports for other stakeholders and make decisions? How can we use software to analyse information? Our BA (Hons) Business Management with Analytics will help you to develop a specialised understanding of analytical methods and utilise software packages to support key business decisions, while honing your core business management skills. In Years Three and Four you’ll take modules that further develop your knowledge and apply analytical techniques in a range of business areas including online e-commerce and social media platforms. In addition, in Year Four you’ll undertake a placement and a practical piece of independent work to expand your expertise to a relevant business context. The route is designed to increase your career options by providing you with a solid foundation in core principles of business management.​</p>
