      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Calum McEachern, who attended Balfron High School in Stirlingshire, was also recognised by the Queen Margaret University Students Union as being the most engaged student throughout his time at the University.  </p>
<p>21 year old Calum from Kippen was joined by his mum Julie and dad Gordon at an impressive ceremony held in Edinburgh’s Usher Hall on the 10th July.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic about taking every opportunity to engage in university life and gain work experience, Calum became one of the most well-known students within the QMU community. By the time of graduation, he had built an impressive CV having worked at a wealth of university corporate events, held a shift supervisor’s position with the student accommodation team and worked at several external hospitality events. Calum had also spent time working with the Dakota Hotel and volunteering at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games – an opportunity offered to him through his degree course. Calum was also one of the dedicated student team who cooked and served a five course banquet to legendary chef Albert Roux during his visit to QMU. </p>
<p>Bernie Quinn, Senior Lecturer in Hospitality and Tourism at Queen Margaret University, said: “Calum is one of the most hard working and engaged students that we have ever had. He put a lot into his study – which paid off with the achievement of a first class degree – and took every opportunity to build his knowledge and skills within the hospitality sector. His ‘can do’ attitude sets a great example to other students and his willingness to participate in opportunities has allowed him to maximise his student experience.</p>
<p>“Calum has an excellent work ethic which will stand him in good stead as he develops his career in the hospitality and tourism industry. We are extremely proud of everything he has achieved during his time at university and wish him the best of luck in the future. We shall miss his wonderful enthusiasm in the university but our loss will certainly be the Hospitality industry’s gain!”</p>
<p>Calum is rarely takes time off from studying and working. Even after graduation, he has continued his involvement with Queen Margaret University and will be working with the University’s catering department throughout the summer months. After the summer, he intends to pursue his career in the hospitality and events industry in Scotland or beyond. </p>]]></Value>
