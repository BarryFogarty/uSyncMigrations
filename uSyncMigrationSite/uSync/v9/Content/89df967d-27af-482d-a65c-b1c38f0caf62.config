      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The University will at all times seek to be sympathetic to, and understanding of, each individual student’s financial circumstances. However, to enable the University to do so, students must engage in dialogue with officers of the University if financial difficulties are being experienced. Students who are experiencing financial difficulties may seek help and advice from the Students’ Union or from Student Services at <a href="mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk" title="Email Student Funding">studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Action to enforce settlement of debt for outstanding fees and charges will be taken in respect of all current and former students who have failed to engage with the University to find a solution to any outstanding debt, or who have failed to honour agreements to pay.</p>]]></Value>

Tuition fee payment options are as follows:-</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(i) in full on commencement of study (or earlier).<br /><br />(ii) by 8 monthly direct debit payments, or by recurring card payment (RCP) normally from October to May (incl) for students starting their programme of study in September.<br /><br />(iii) in full 21 days from the date of invoice<br /><br />(iv) by 8 monthly direct debit payments, or by recurring card payment (RCP) from January to August (inclusive) for students starting their programme of study in January.</p>\n<p>If for any reason the amount of fees is not known at the time of commencement of study, payment is due in full 21 days from the date of invoice, or by direct debit/recurring card payments provided payments are completed by May and August respectively.</p>\n<p>All returning students are reminded that they must set-up a new direct debit/recurring card payment arrangement for each Academic Year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tuition fees may be paid by direct debit or recurring card payment instalments over a maximum of eight months from the commencement of the programme. For students commencing programmes at the start of the academic year, instalment payments will normally be due from October to May inclusive. Late direct debit/recurring card payment arrangements still require all payments to be completed by May. For students who commence programmes at other points during the academic year, details of payment dates will be advised.  Failure to keep direct debit/recurring card payments continuing will result in the remaining balance becoming due for immediate payment. </li>\n<li>Self funding students who have a net tuition fee amount payable of £12,500.00 or more are eligible for a 5% discount on the fee payable, provided they settle in full prior to 31 October or within 7 days from the date of invoice, whichever is the earlier. The discount will be calculated at 5% of the net fee payable (i.e. after any scholarship). For January starts the 5% discount will be applicable provided the fees are settled in full prior to 28th February or within 7 days from the date of invoice, whichever is the earlier. Any Scholarships Awarded will not be included in the calculation of any discount. <strong><u><br /><br /></u></strong></li>\n<li>A debt is deemed overdue when at the expiry of 21 days from the date of invoice, no payment has been received in full nor have direct debit/recurring card payment arrangements been put in place. <br /><br /></li>\n<li>When a tuition fee debt becomes overdue, Finance staff will instigate a series of actions as follows :</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(i)      1<sup>st</sup> reminder letter asking the student to contact the Finance Office immediately to pay the fee due or to make arrangements to pay</p>\n<p>(ii)     if there is no response to the 1<sup>st</sup> reminder letter/email within 7 days of issue, a 2nd reminder letter./email is sent giving the student 7 days to contact the Finance Office.</p>\n<p>(iii)    if there is no response to the 2<sup>nd</sup> reminder within 7 days of issue, a FINAL DEMAND will be sent, advising the student that their Smartcard will be deactivated and will also result in the debt being referred to a debt recovery agency (which incurs additional recovery charges that will be charged to the student). Where a student’s debt requires to be sent to a debt recovery agency, the student may be required to withdraw from their course.</p>\n<p>(iv)   Should a direct debit/recurring card payment be cancelled prior to the expiry date or no payment received on the due date, the full remaining debt becomes immediately due. Smartcards will be disabled after 7 days until either (a) the debt is paid in full or (b) alternative payment arrangements are put in place. After a further 7 days if the debt remains unpaid or no alternative arrangements have been put in place the full debt will be passed to our debt recovery agency for action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It should be noted that academic tutors are not empowered to vary fees nor to agree payment schedules with students on behalf of the university.</strong> All questions regarding payment of fees must be addressed to the Finance Office in the first instance.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>As the main object of the reminder letters is to make contact with the student, Finance staff will also send e-mail reminders and/or text messages and will also attempt to make telephone contact with the student as appropriate. The University reserves the right to use all contact details provided by the student. It is the responsibility of students to ensure that the University is provided with current contact details.</li>\n</ul>"
