Applicants living in an area of high deprivation, as defined by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) will be identified through the home postcode given in their application.<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">LEAPS is a widening participation programme, funded by higher education institutions and local council partners, to increase progression to higher education in South East Scotland. LEAPS offers different levels of support to students, based on individual eligibility and whether their school is classified as LEAPS Group 1+, LEAPS Group 1, or LEAPS Group 2. Applicants who have participated in the LEAPS programme will be identified from the information they provide in their UCAS application.

This care may have been provided in a one of many different settings such as in residential care, foster care, kinship care, or through being looked after at home with a supervision requirement.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If an applicant has caring responsibilities, this should be identified by the applicant in the personal statement of their UCAS application. A student carer is anyone who cares, unpaid, for a friend or family member who due to illness, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction cannot cope without their support.<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If an applicant is estranged, this should be identified by the applicant in the personal statement in their UCAS application. We strongly encourage applicants who are estranged to declare this as part of their application.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>An estranged student is someone who no longer has the support of their family due to breakdown in their relationship which has led to ceased contact. This might mean biological or adoptive parents or wider family members who have been responsible for supporting a student in the past. Estranged students have no experience of being in care and do not have a corporate parent responsible for them.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If an applicant is an armed forces/ex-military veteran, this should be identified by the applicant in the personal statement of their UCAS application.</li>\n</ul>"

Entry requirements are published on the individual course pages on our website and within our prospectus.</p>\n<p>The University guarantees to make an offer of admission, or an offer of an interview or audition to any care experienced student or any student from a LEAPS Group 1+ school who has the potential to meet the ‘minimum’ entry requirements for a programme. While we will try wherever possible to guarantee applicants either an interview or a place on the specific course they have applied to, this will not be possible in every circumstance. If we cannot offer an interview or place on the specific course an applicant has applied to, we will endeavour to offer an interview or place on an alternative programme in a related subject instead. It may not be possible to offer an applicant an interview or place on their chosen course for one of the following reasons: it is a course with lots of applicants and not many places; or places are strictly limited by the Scottish Government (e.g. teacher training, nursing, paramedic science). </p>"
