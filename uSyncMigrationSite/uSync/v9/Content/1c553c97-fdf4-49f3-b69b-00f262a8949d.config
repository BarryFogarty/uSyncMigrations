The content of these days is tailored to local needs and they are run in close collaboration with NHS Education Scotland Practice Education Leads (PELs).</p>\n<p><strong>Facilitating Practice-Based Learning Framework</strong> the framework consists of four modules, presented at varying levels of academic depth and complexity. Each module builds upon the skills and knowledge presented in the previous module.  Depending on the participant's previous level of knowledge and experience, a range of entry and exit points is provided.  Movement between modules is possible in order to be responsive to learners' needs. </p>\n<p>Mentorship preparation in Nursing is provided in line with NMC requirements.</p>"
