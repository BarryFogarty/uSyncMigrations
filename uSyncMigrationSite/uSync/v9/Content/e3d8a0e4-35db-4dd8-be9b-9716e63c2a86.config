      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>We caught up with Ben, who told us more about why he chose to come to QMU, the highlights of his time here and his hopes for the future.  </strong></p>
<p><strong><span>What were you doing before you came to QMU?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Before I came to QMU I completed a Higher National Certificate (HNC) in Social Science </span><span>at Newbattle Abbey College </span><span>and worked in a</span> <span>primary scho</span><span>ol as a pupil support assistant. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Why did you choose QMU?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I chose QMU because I love the modern feel of the campus. It is a very forward-thinking, inclusive and fun environment with great facilities and staff. I had some friends who had attended QMU and loved it, so I wanted to give it a go for myself.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Why did you choose this course?</span></strong> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="I chose the BA (Hons) Education Studies (Primary) because I have always wanted to be a teacher. I thought it would be an exciting opportunity to be a part of the first generation of teachers to graduate from QMU. It’s great that we gain 30 weeks of experience teaching in a variety of schools before becoming qualified primary teachers ourselves.  " source="Ben Ferguson" sourceExtra="" />
<p><strong><span>What have you enjoyed most about education studies (Primary)?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I have really enjoyed the practical elements of the course. For example, learning British Sign Language (BSL), completing the</span> <span>Forest Outdoor Learning Award (FOLA) and, of course, getting to go out on placement and teach in primary schools.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What have been your highlights at QMU? </span></strong> </p>
<p><span>The highlights really have been the people. I have made friends for life from all over the world at QMU. I think friendship is a key factor to your success at university and having a close support network is really important in allowing you to achieve academically. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Did you access any of the support services?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I have visited the Effective Learning Service </span><span>which was great in supporting me and helping to ensure my work was as good as possible. The team can provide 1-2-1 support and is great at helping you learn how to write in an academic style. It is a great service!</span><span> </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Are you involved in any extra-curricular activities or clubs?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I am part of the music society which is great fun! Joining societies is a fantastic way to meet new friends and try new things, I definitely recommend it! </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Did you find enough support from your lecturers over your studies? </span></strong> </p>
<p><span>We are really lucky to have such a broad range of expertise </span><span>across </span><span>our lecturing team. They are very supportive and are always solution</span><span>-focused a</span><span>nd want the best for you.</span> </p>
<p><span>As the first cohort of primary teachers from QMU, we got to know our lecturers really w</span><span>ell, whi</span><span>ch is something I don't think happens at some of the bigger universities. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What advice would you give to someone coming to this course?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Make sure you have had a chance to get into a school classroom prior to coming to QMU and make the most of all the opportunities that are offered to you here.</span><strong><span> </span></strong> </p>
<p><strong><span>What are your plans following graduation?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I am planning on travelling around Greece for the summer before coming back and teaching my first class during my probation year!</span> </p>]]></Value>
