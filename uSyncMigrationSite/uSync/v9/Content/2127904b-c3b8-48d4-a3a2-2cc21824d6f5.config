Presiding over the evening was the President of Sigma, Dr Beth Baldwin Tigges and Dr Liz Madigan, Sigma’s CEO. New Principal Sir Paul Grice represented QMU, alongside Professor Fiona Coutts, Dean of the School of Health Sciences, and Professors Jan Dewing and Brendan McCormack - President and Vice-President of the Omega Xi chapter. Distinguished guests also included leaders in the field of Nursing from NHS Lothian, NHS Fife, NHS Education for Scotland and the Queen’s Nursing Institute of Scotland.</p>
<p>There was a Scottish theme to the evening’s proceedings, with a piper and dancer to welcome guests and tartan décor nodding to Sigma’s blue and purple brand colours. The event was also live-streamed via YouTube to allow those unable to make it there in person to be able to find out more about Sigma and the benefits of membership.</p>
<p>Sigma Theta Tau International is a global community of nursing with over 135,000 active members in more than 90 countries. There are around 530 Chapters in over 700 Higher Education Institutions across all five continents linking Nurses who are at the top of their professions to share, learn and develop their nursing practice. The Omega Xi chapter is committed to the support of learning and professional development of all undergraduate and postgraduate nurses at Queen Margaret University.</p>
<p>Sigma President Dr Beth Baldwin Tigges said, “It was a joy and an honour to preside over the Omega Xi chapter chartering and recognize all the ways our colleagues from Scotland contribute to global nursing excellence. I look forward to seeing the Scottish flag displayed for the first time at Sigma’s 45th Biennial Convention next month in Washington, D.C.”</p>
<p>Professor Jan Dewing, Omega Xi President, said: “We are truly delighted to have achieved the standard required for Sigma Membership and are already focusing on moving forward with our Chapter Plan, particularly working with our European Region colleagues.”</p>

      <Value><![CDATA[Queen Margaret University (QMU) has become the first registered chapter of Sigma Theta Tau Honour Society of Nursing (Sigma) in Scotland. Sigma is the second-largest nursing organisation in the world and supports the learning and professional development of its members who strive to improve nursing care worldwide. QMU’s chapter, Omega Xi, is also only the third to be registered in the United Kingdom.

The chartering ceremony was held at the University last Friday, 18 October, and marked the chapter’s official formation day. Presiding over the evening was the President of Sigma, Dr Beth Baldwin Tigges and Dr Liz Madigan, Sigma’s CEO. New Principal Sir Paul Grice represented QMU, alongside Professor Fiona Coutts, Dean of the School of Health Sciences, and Professors Jan Dewing and Brendan McCormack - President and Vice-President of the Omega Xi chapter. Distinguished guests also included leaders in the field of Nursing from NHS Lothian, NHS Fife, NHS Education for Scotland and the Queen’s Nursing Institute of Scotland.

There was a Scottish theme to the evening’s proceedings, with a piper and dancer to welcome guests and tartan décor nodding to Sigma’s blue and purple brand colours. The event was also live-streamed via YouTube to allow those unable to make it there in person to be able to find out more about Sigma and the benefits of membership.
