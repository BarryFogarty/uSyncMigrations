<p>We will be delighted to share our graduation film with you on the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> July, which will include messages from our Chancellor, Prue Leith, and a variety of staff from across the University, as well as my graduation address. The film will also contain inspirational stories and messages from recent QMU graduates who wanted to share in congratulating you on your achievement.</p>
<p>No QMU graduation would be complete without pipe band music. We are therefore delighted to be able to incorporate some wonderful traditional Scottish tunes into the film, which are performed by young people from The Preston Lodge High School Pipe Band in Prestonpans.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend our on-campus celebration, please do join your QMU family on either the 13<sup>th</sup> or 14 July in watching this celebratory film on our website, wherever you are in the world. We hope you will also invite your family, guardians and friends to watch the graduation film and that you take this opportunity to make a day of it. So, dress up, have a bottle of fizz at the ready, and prepare to celebrate your graduation achievements!</p>
<p>Please be assured that we are doing everything possible to create something memorable, so we can all mark the culmination of all your hard work. At the same time, we need to be mindful that, despite our best efforts, changing Government restrictions could impact on our plans and result in us having to alter or scale down plans or even, in the worst case, cancel the graduation celebratory event altogether. But we look to the future with positivity, and will focus on making your graduation celebration a reality.</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to join us at one of our graduation celebration days, or that you come together with your QMU family to celebrate by watching the QMU graduation film. In the meantime, please do check the <a href="/news-and-events/events-listing/graduation-celebrations-july-2021/">QMU Graduation</a> page on our website to keep-up-to-date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With very best wishes<br /><br />Paul Grice<br />Principal</p>]]></Value>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>With Coronavirus restrictions still in place, it will come as no surprise to you that we have had to rethink arrangements planned for our 2021 graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>As you will know, we had initially planned to hold graduation ceremonies for the graduating class of 2021 on 14<sup>th</sup> July in the Usher Hall, and a graduation celebration for the class of 2020 on 13<sup>th</sup> July, also in the Usher Hall. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the current restrictions placed on large scale gatherings indoors will be lifted in time for either of these events to take place – particularly as the Usher Hall is currently being used as a COVID test centre.</p>
<p>However, we are fully aware of the importance of the graduation ceremony as a milestone in the student journey. We are very keen to provide students with an opportunity to mark the successful completion of their studies, and to reward them for their resilience, hard work and determination, particularly after such a challenging year.</p>
<p>We have a team of colleagues from across the University who are working hard to shape up an outdoor celebration for both the Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021 which will be held on <strong>Tuesday 13<sup>th</sup> and Wednesday 14<sup>th</sup> July</strong>. As we do not yet know what restrictions will be placed on outdoor gatherings on these dates, we are unable to confirm all details for these events at this time. However, we hope that the following information will be helpful and we will continue to share more specific plans with you as soon as we are in a position to do so.</p>]]></Value>
