It employs adult learning perspectives including: learner responsibility, active participation, collaboration, autonomy, and learning as a community. Problem-based learning using practice scenarios is an important part of the learning experience, where students work to develop professional reasoning, evidence-informed decision making, and interpersonal and team working skills. Learning is thus a facilitated process of acquiring enquiry skills, interpreting information, group discussion, exchanging of perspectives, creation of knowledge and arriving at a position or judgment. Teaching methods incorporate self-directed study, practice scenarios, group work, workshops, e-Learning modules, digital technology, reflection, lectures and placements.</p>\n<p>Assessment methods include peer and self-assessment, written assignments, viva voce assessments, presentations, projects and placements.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>There are four placements in total, all full-time:</p>\n<p><strong>Year One</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practice-based Learning 1 (6 weeks) </li>\n<li>Practice-based Learning 2 (6 weeks)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Year Two</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practice-based Learning 3 (9 weeks) </li>\n<li>Practice-based Learning 4 (10 weeks)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Placements can take place anywhere in Scotland. QMU allocates all placements in collaboration with students. Placements are situated in health, social care, education and the third sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module studied on campus will require you to attend classes and carry out independent work. Academic modules require you to attend QMU from 9.00am to 6.00pm. You should be aware that services may operate over seven working days, so placements may involve evening and weekend attendance. You will be expected to mirror the working hours of practice educators and be required to purchase professional indemnity insurance.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Normally, we have up to 40 pre-registration MSc students in any given cohort. Some of the classes will be integrated with our other pre-registration occupational therapy students undertaking the 4 year route (MOccTher/ BSc Hons), please contact the team for more information about class sizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
