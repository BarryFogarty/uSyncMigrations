      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Held on the 22 February, the stakeholder engagement event is open to all, with a particular focus on people from the local and business community, public and third sector bodies, arts and cultural organisations, local alumni and other individuals with an interest in learning more about the University’s work, and how they can become involved with, or benefit directly from, that work.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="We look forward to welcoming people to the University to meet staff and students, members of the University Court, the Principal and members of the senior team, and to gain insight into the amazing work and the range of initiatives in which we are involved, or indeed, lead. It’s an excellent opportunity for attendees to network informally, and to make meaningful connections that may lead to future partnership opportunities." source="Pamela Woodburn, Chair of the University Court" sourceExtra="" />
<p>Pamela continued: “As a university anchored firmly in East Lothian, but with a global reach, we are focused, through our teaching, research and innovation, on addressing the aspirations and needs of our local, national and international communities. This event is an opportunity for us to showcase areas in which we work collaboratively currently with a range of stakeholders.  We know that many more such opportunities exist, and what better way to explore that than to welcome individuals from a range of organisations and backgrounds into the University to see what we do, and to enable them to make new connections with us or deepen their existing links.”</p>
<p>Guests attending can expect an informal exhibition that will showcase a range of projects and developments, as well as a brief presentation and a Q&amp;A session with the Principal and the Chair of Court. Those with an interest in nature and the outdoors will have the chance to explore QMU’s outdoor space and learn about the development of QMU’s Outdoor Learning Hub. Guests will also be offered informal tours of the indoor spaces and facilities. Light refreshments and opportunities to network with staff and other guests will also be available.</p>
<p>Tours of the Outdoor Learning Zone will take place at the start of the event at 4.30pm. Guests participating in the outdoor tour are advised to bring appropriate footwear and outdoor clothing.</p>
<p>Attendance at the Stakeholder Engagement is free and places can be booked at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/qmu-local-impact-and-global-reach-a-stakeholder-event-tickets-511527280867">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
