Assessment throughout the course will take a variety of forms, including essays, reports, exams, group and individual presentations, as well as a dissertation or project for the final MA component.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements/Industry-based learning</strong></p>\n<p>The course does not require a formal placement, but we do require students to take up industry-based learning opportunities to assist their learning and to put the theory into practice. These industry-based learning opportunities are offered by many of the world-famous organisations that are based in Edinburgh (eg the Edinburgh International Festival. Although we support students to find opportunities, you are required to secure your own arrangements in line with your personal interests. As we are in Edinburgh, the world’s first and best ‘Festival City’, there are no end of opportunities in this regards, and we are well regarded by our industry peers: many of our alumni now work in these organisations and advocate for us.

For those undertaking part-time study, you will only be required on campus for one of these days per each year of study. Each module involves around 30 hours of face-to-face teaching. Timetables will normally be available to matriculated students around one month before you commence your studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Normally, there are around 30 to 35 students enrolling on the course each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

They will look at policy in a critical manner and assessments include a short article as well as a longer essay examining the function of policy in regards to the cultural sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Designing Qualitative Research (20 credits):</strong> This module will prepare students to undertake a postgraduate research project by developing their knowledge and understanding of qualitative research methodologies and methods. Students will interrogate their own assumptions of knowledge production and research, and the assessment (a Lit Review and Research Proposal) can be used as a mechanism to prepare for the dissertation project</p>\n<p><strong>Fundraising, Finance and Development (20 credits): </strong>This module will equip students with a critical understanding of the principles and practices of fundraising, development and financial management. The assessments invite students to examine financial support mechanisms (eg, completing a funding application or designing a sponsorship pack) as well as financial literacy exam. This module marks our course as quite unique in this regards.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning and Marketing Cultural Projects (20 credits):</strong> This module will provide students with a critical understanding of the principal skills, techniques and practices necessary to manage and market a cultural project. This modules looks at the practical realities of managing and marketing cultural projects and learning occurs around hypothetical projects that the students plan and market in groups.(Note: if you can prove you have already undertaken significant experience within this study, you can opt to take another 20 credit module from the School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management)</p>\n<p><strong>Students should select one of the following:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Leadership and Arts Management in Practice (20 credits):</strong> This module will provide students with a critical understanding of the principles and practices of leadership and management in arts and cultural organisations and will support students to become reflective practitioners, confident in their ability to employ and adapt theory in relation to the organisational contexts in which they may work. Students will also attend field trips and receive experts in the field who will talk about their practical realities as cultural managers. This is the module that also houses the ‘industry based experience’ element</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluating Cultural Projects (20 credits):</strong> This module will provide students with the knowledge and understanding to effectively design and execute the evaluation of arts and cultural projects. A very student-driven module, this is an optional choice instead of Arts Management in Practice and can only be taken if a real-time Cultural Project is occurring that the student can access.</p>\n<p><strong>Dissertation Project (60 credits):</strong> Through undertaking a self-directed project that suits their strengths, interests and career aspirations, students will have the opportunity to undertake a substantial piece of work that will develop their academic rigour, professional skills, independence and self-direction. This can be a 12,000 word research dissertation; or a Business-planning document (eg a Feasibility study) along with a 5000 word critical reflective essay; or a Cultural Project with associated portfolio of evidence and 5000 word reflective essay.</p>\n<p>NB The modules listed are correct at time of posting (December 2023) but are subject to change. In the event that modules change, QMU will seek to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that there is no detrimental impact on students.</p>"

How often do I need to be on campus?</li>\n<li>What are the modules? When are they taught?</li>\n<li>How do the ‘Block Taught’ modules work?</li>\n<li>What are the Industry-based Learning requirements? (Internships)</li>\n<li>What kind of assignments will I be required to do?</li>\n<li>Am I still eligible to apply if I do not have an undergraduate degree?</li>\n<li>I have not studied in some time – will I be able to complete the course?</li>\n<li>Who are the other people that generally attend the programme?</li>\n<li>Can I do any reading to prepare myself for the course?  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is the difference between the PgCert, PgDip and MA?</strong></p>\n<p>The PgCert Arts Management requires 60 credits (3 successfully completed 20 credit modules). </p>\n<p>The PgDip Arts Festival and Cultural Management requires 120 credits (6 successfully completed 20 credit modules)</p>\n<p>The MA Arts, Festival and Cultural Management requires 180 Credits and includes the self-directed dissertation module, worth 60 credits. If you enrol for the MA and then decide you do not want to complete the course then it is possible to leave with a PgCert or PgDip depending on the amount of credits you have gained. The key dates (whole days of study) for the 2020/21 term are yet to be confirmed, but are likely to be as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Induction Days - 2 days attendance at QMU</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Leadership, Governance and Strategy (Not for Profit) - 4 days attendance at QMU</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Fundraising, Development and Finance - 4 days attendance at QMU plus an exam</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> You then have a choice from either Evaluating Arts and Cultural Projects OR Arts Management in Practice:</p>\n<p>- If you select <strong>Evaluating Arts and Cultural Projects - 2 days attendance at QMU</strong></p>\n<p>- If you select <strong>Arts Management in Practice - 2 days attendance at QMU plus various field trips throughout the year. These could be on various days and time and a calendar will be provided close to the start of each term. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>What is the difference between the full-time and the part-time pathway?</strong></p>\n<p> There are no academic differences between the pathways: the only difference is the length of time you are required to commit to the courses. At full-time, you will complete the course in 12 months (unless starting in January, explained in more detail below). For part-time, you will generally take 24 months, (but up to a maximum of 7 years)</p>\n<p><strong>What is the difference between the January and September starting points?</strong></p>\n<p>As above, there is no academic difference between the starting points: the only differences are the order you will complete the modules in and the length of time you are required to commit to the programme. As a student must complete all modules before taking the final dissertation project, a full-time January start will take 15 months to complete the course, but a full-time September start will take 12 months.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this, a full-time, September start will begin in Semester 1 (Sept - Dec), then move on to Semester 2 (Jan - Apr) and then to the final dissertation module in Semester 3 (May - Aug) with a successful degree being conferred in June of that year. The graduation would be in the July of the following year.</p>\n<p>A January start, however, will begin in Semester 2 (Jan - Apr), have the summer months off from studies (Semester 3 - May - Aug), begin again in Semester 1 (Sept - Dec), and then complete their final dissertation module in Semester 2 (Jan - Apr) with a successful degree being conferred in June of that year. The graduation would be in the July of that year.</p>\n<p>While there this attention to both within each term, some students find that the January semester is more ‘practically’ oriented and the September term more ‘theoretically’ focused: going through the whole MA will ensure you explore both elements.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the time commitment? How often do I need to be on campus?</strong></p>\n<p>All teaching days for this programme will normally happen on Thursdays and Fridays. Depending on if you are part-time or full-time, you would need to be on campus either for one or both of those days each week. These days may include taught components in the morning and the afternoon. Whilst these classes have varied start and end times through the year, it is good to prepare to be on campus from 9:15 - 5:15 on each of these days.</p>\n<p>We also teach one module each taught semester (Sept-Dec, and Jan-April) through a ‘Block Taught’ format - these are explained in a bit more depth below</p>\n<p>On top of this, we would also suggest at least 16 to 20 hours a week to self-directed study (for Full Time Students) to focus on associated group work, reading and assignments. There are also field-trips, as well as industry-based learning elements to consider. If you are already working within the field, you can use this towards your industry-based learning requirements - see below for more information about this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What are the modules?

This means we have compressed the regular 12 weeks of teaching into four intensive, day-long sessions. The benefits of this is that you are required to attend less modules on campus each week, but it also means assignments and assessments are more evenly spaced out throughout the terms.</p>\n<p>These block-taught modules will normally be scheduled on the Thursday/Friday teaching days. The 1st semester’s block-taught module is Leadership, Governance and Strategy (Not for Profit), and the 2nd semester’s block-taught module is Fundraising, Development and Finance</p>\n<p><strong>What are the Industry-based Learning requirements? (Internships) </strong></p>\n<p>In regards to Industry-based learning, we require that students take up work-based, placement opportunities to assist their learning and to put the theory into practice. These are not traditional ‘time-delineated’ internships (eg, several months of required working) but rather self-directed placements that the student undertakes in a field or organisation most suited to them and their interests. Many internships/placements opportunities are offered by the world-famous organisations that are based in Edinburgh (for example, the Edinburgh International Festival, or the International Film Festival), and these are advertised. Although we support students to find opportunities, students are required to secure your own arrangements in line with your personal interests - for example, if you were specifically interested in Dance, you could seek out a placement at a dance organisation here in Edinburgh and we would support you in liaising with the specific organisation in order to arrange that and/or writing a letter of support etc. As we are in Edinburgh - the world’s first and best Festival City - we have no end of opportunities in this regards, and we are well regarded by our industry peers: many of our alumni work in these organisations now and advocate for us. If you are already working in the sector then can use your existing employment as the site for your Industry-based learning.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of assignments will I be required to do?</strong></p>\n<p>The methods used vary from module to module. Students’ performance is assessed through a variety of methods including essays, reports, reflective portfolios, group work, an exam and a dissertation or project. There are also often formative (non-graded) assessments as well as summative (graded) assessments.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I still eligible to apply if I do not have an undergraduate degree?</strong></p>\n<p> We do consider significant experience as valid learning that allows students to enter into the programme without a previous undergraduate degree, however, you should have had significant previous experience of working in the capacity of a supervisor or manager. These applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis and you should contact the admissions team or co-programme leader Anthony Schrag on should you wish to discuss this further.</p>\n<p><strong>I have not studied in some time – will I be able to complete the course?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of the students on the programme are returning to study after a long period out of university. As such, the induction provides an opportunity for some refreshers in regards to key study skills. Attendance at the induction day is therefore expected. We do also recommend that you familiarise yourself with such things as essay writing formats and library research and can recommend study skills books to help with this. QMU offers students access to an Effective Learning Service and Royal Literary Fellow to assist students with their writing and study skills and you should consider availing yourself of these services as soon as possible so that you can be up to speed on the necessary requirements of academic study.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are the other people that generally attend the programme?</strong></p>\n<p>The course’s diverse student profile is one of its strengths. We have a mix of students at all stages in their career - from recent graduates just starting out to directors who are managing successful cultural projects that attend to refresh their skills; from individual artists wishing to develop a more managerial outlook to those already working in the field and undertaking Continuing Professional Development supported by their organisation. This diversity of experience is useful to compare and contrast different insights as well as developing a diverse peer-support network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I do any reading to prepare myself for the course? </strong></p>\n<p>The following books will give you a good grounding in the sorts of material we cover in the course. They are core texts, and so reading them sooner will give you an advantage when it comes to the lectures and assignments. </p>\n<p>- Bell, D. and Oakley, K. 2015. <em>Cultural Policy</em>. Abingdon: Routledge </p>\n<p>- Cunliffe., A. 2014. <em>A Very Short Fairly Interesting and Reasonably Cheap Book About Management</em>. London: SAGE Publications Ltd</p>\n<p>- Varbanova, L. 2013. <em>Strategic Management in the Arts</em>. Abingdon: Routledge </p>\n<p> We also have a wide range of nationalities who can offer diverse international perspectives and cross-cultural network opportunities.</p>"
