<p><span class="lead">13. Teaching and learning methods and strategies</span></p>
<p>A hybrid PBL (H-PBL) approach is the working model for the programme. The main aims of this chosen approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to foster problem posing and problem solving skills</li>
<li>to synthesise knowledge from relevant informing disciplines</li>
<li>to develop high level interpersonal skills particularly in relation to learning about teamwork and interagency work</li>
<li>to promote reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action</li>
<li>to provide the student with a real world context for learning</li>
<li>to promote conceptual versatility</li>
<li>to encourage creativity and independence of enquiry</li>
<li>to promote autonomous intellectual endeavour</li>
<li>to promote critical reflection of self and others</li>
</ul>
<p>In selecting a broad definition of problem based learning as the focus of learning and teaching within this programme a blended approach to learning will allow flexibility of delivery and to suit different<br />learning styles. Methods and approaches will incorporate: case based learning, project work, small scale investigations, personal and professional portfolio, student centred, peer and group learning, key note lectures, professional contacts, reflective diaries, self and peer assessment and e-learning. In relation to e-learning, all students will be introduced to the HUB which provides an important forum for group discussion and communication and is used in all modules (including practice education) to promote critical reflection and sharing throughout the learning experience.</p>
<p><br />This model will therefore continue to offer students the opportunity to participate in a variety of learning methods which will foster personal autonomy, promote high-level interpersonal skills, offer a climate for deep learning and promote reflective practice. Where practice education is integrated with academic studies, it permits very immediate possibilities to reflect on practice. This constitutes a strength of the curriculum where students can appreciate the transactional relationship between theory and practice.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment strategies</strong></p>
<p>A variety of formative and summative assessment methods are used to reflect the range of learning and teaching methods. The majority of the assessments are through summative coursework assignments which are consistent with the overall aims of the programme and follow the principles of adult learning. The choice of assessment methods are informed by the nature of the module and this leads to an eclectic mix of strategies including reports, essays, group work, oral presentations to the cohort, individual viva voce, practical work, reviews of literature, systematic reviews, a research proposal, project work and experiential learning on practice education. This results in versatile learners who can negotiate different expectations. Those expectations are made clear to students within the module and at various times in the curriculum, students are invited to offer a reflective piece on the experience.</p>
<p>Formative assessment is carried out through the means of the HUB where questions are posted by staff on a regular basis in each of the modules. Students are required to individually respond using their “new” knowledge and previous experiences. Students are also formatively assessed in terms of evaluating their own behaviours and that of others through the mechanisms of specific instruments (see Self Evaluation and Peer Evaluation Forms in the appendices). Vivas and small projects will also be part of the formative and summative assessments.</p>
<p>Assessment of students’ performance during practice placements continues to be based on forms which are well respected by educators and students, having been in use (and reviewed) over the past six years. Assessment forms are structured around learning outcomes with associated criteria; increasing demands on students are evident from both the learning outcomes for each placement and the text of each progressive assessment form. Service user feedback is now gathered on student performance during practice placement.</p>
