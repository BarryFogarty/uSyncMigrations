      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Initial teacher education at QMU (PGDEs)</span></p>
<p>For many decades, QMU was renowned internationally for the training of domestic science teachers. We returned to our roots when we launched our new<a href="/{localLink:umb://document/d223103b97b14953a14816d418c6c824}" title="PGDE Secondary (Home Economics)"> PGDE Secondary (Home Economics)</a> in August 2019. This one-year course addresses a skills shortage relating to home economics teaching within our secondary schools. The course educates aspiring teachers, preparing them to fill vital posts in secondary schools and positively influence young people’s knowledge and skills relating to food, nutrition, health and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Today, our portfolio of education courses is built on a firm foundation of social science and, as well as the Home Economics PGDE, we have introduced a <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/b6594f8f0a2f40da837c8a782e7966e3}" title="PGDE Secondary (Business Education)">PGDE Secondary (Business Education)</a> and <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/6878111872aa48848fb20e4fdf1613f1}" title="PGDE Secondary (Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies)">PGDE Secondary (Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies)</a></p>
<p><span class="lead">On-demand online courses</span></p>
<p>We also offer a range of flexible, <strong><a href="https://online.qmu.ac.uk/about-us/">online master’s courses</a></strong> in <a href="https://online.qmu.ac.uk/ma-educational-leadership-part-time-qmue-mmaedlop.html" title="MA Educational Leadership">MA Educational Leadership,</a> <a href="https://online.qmu.ac.uk/ma-education-part-time-qmue-mmaeduop.html" title="MA Education">MA Education,</a> and <a href="https://online.qmu.ac.uk/ma-special-and-inclusive-education-part-time-qmue-mmasieop.html" title="MA Special and Inclusive Education">MA Special and Inclusive Education.</a></p>
<p>Located in the <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/6e5272fa3f544060af877ca7f121f21c}" title="Psychology, Sociology and Education">Division of Psychology, Sociology &amp; Education</a>, all of our teacher education courses draw on a firm foundation of psychological and sociological knowledge and practice. We also champion effective collaborative working between allied health professionals and educators, collaborate with our experts and a range of professionals in child development, welfare and wellbeing, and, of course, we enjoy our heritage in food-related subjects.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Professional development for professionals already working in education </span></p>
<p>We also offer two long-established education courses for professionals already working in education:</p>
<p>The <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/914c350a3e8c4819afb23c51ac5cdd07}" title="e-PgCert Professional and Higher Education">e-PgCert Professional and Higher Education </a>is for people who teach and support learning in higher education, for example: nurses and midwives, allied health professionals, social workers, doctors, lecturers in any discipline and professional services staff (e.g. university librarians). The e-PgCert is delivered fully online.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why study with QMU?</span></p>
<p>All of our education courses are <strong>forward-thinking and focused on the needs of today’s educators in a rapidly changing society</strong>. Each offers a critical approach to working with learning and teaching in today’s communities and, in a variety of stimulating ways, explores the interface of social justice, wellbeing, learning and creativity.</p>
<p>We focus on providing the <strong>optimum balance of theoretical and practical knowledg</strong>e. We aspire to instil the value of achieving that balance in the students who study education with us, encouraging a researcher-practitioner model of educator, one who is curious, open to challenge and is community and research engaged.</p>
<p>As <strong>social justice is central to QMU’s mission</strong>, this value is hard-wired into our approach to education, and our community of students, staff and alumni is characterised by people who want to make a real practical difference in the world.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Strong industry links</span></p>
<p>All Scottish students on our PDGE courses will be guaranteed a job for one year in a Scottish school following graduation, as part of the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) Teacher Induction Scheme. After graduating, candidates register with the GTCS for provisional registration and on successful completion of a probationary teaching year will be awarded full registration.</p>
<p>Our e-PgCert Professional and Higher Education prepares participants to apply independently for Associate and Fellowship status with Advance HE (Higher Education Academy).</p>
<p><span class="lead">Our friendly and supportive approach to learning and teaching</span></p>
<p>Students on any of our education courses can be assured that they will learn in a friendly and supportive environment and that they will benefit from an academically rigorous approach, informed by our research expertise.</p>
<p>Our philosophy as an institution emphasises student support and our relatively small size means that we can develop strong working relationships with all our students.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Preparing you for a fulfilling career</span></p>
<p>Each of our education courses prepares you to lead in innovative practice and help others fulfil their potential.</p>
