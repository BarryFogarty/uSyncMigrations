<p>Applying ethnographic methods to a health or clinic setting can be a valuable tool for health researchers. Herdt (1999) states that “what distinguishes clinical ethnography from anthropological ethnography in general is (a) the application of disciplined clinical training to ethnographic problems and (b) developmental concern with desires and meanings as they are distributed culturally within groups and across the course of life”. Researchers are able to immerse themselves to a degree, allowing for richer understanding of the social and power dynamics of a clinic, provider behaviours, patient perceptions and experiences of health care. This can be important for assessing issues such as: access to care, quality of care, continuity of care, and other barriers to care including indirect costs (e.g. transportation) and lack of trust in health care providers.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Long (2008) explains the value of using ethnographic methods in a hospital, providing opportunities to explore not only the organisational and structural characteristics of an institutional system, but also a space where new identities are forged: “for many people, hospitals are places in which their previous identities as a healthy person, as a mobile person, as an immobile person, are stripped bare. New identities, such as a cancer survivor, a more mobile person with a new hip, a rehabilitated person with one less limb are forged”. Patients, health providers and a range of staff members and visitors (including researchers) move about these spaces, bringing with them multiple roles and skillsets, which have an impact on the way illness and treatment, are experienced. Gordon (2004) usefully describes clinic ethnography as: “the attempt to situate clinical cases within a cultural framework, one that is based on both the specialized expertise of the clinician and the broad-based grasp of cultural issues that characterizes the ethnographer”.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Undertaking clinic ethnography involves a range of participatory and non-participatory data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews, observations using “thick” description, and reviews of routine data sources (e.g. treatment register, patient records, clinic guidelines and protocols). These are used to develop patient case studies, clinic mapping, infrastructural assessment, tracking patient pathways, time-motion studies for different cadres of health workers. Additional participatory techniques (e.g. action research, photo-voice, Participant Ethnographic Evaluation Research) may be used to support the collection and collation of detailed field notes. Specifically, the methods outlined in this manual will allow you to capture issues relating to space, infrastructure (e.g. building design equipment, and technology), consumables (e.g. medicines and medical devices), as well as movement and flow of patients and health workers, and ideas and values about health, risk, illness, and health- related behaviours; all issues which are pertinent to settings where NCD and MHPSS care is provided.</p>

For research conducted under the support of the NIHR Research Unit on Health in Fragility, this principally involves building understanding of patients’ and health providers’ experiences of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services in primary health care (PHC) facilities, noting that in PHC facilities, continuity of care and encouragement to return is a key goal. The methods outlined in this manual are designed to provide preliminary evidence in support of assessing patient trajectories to care, patient treatment adherence issues and staff experiences as providers of care. This includes understanding patient knowledge about their risk of illness, illness experience and/or treatment and staff communications and interactions during care.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

For instance, if the study is focusing on a particular NCD, you may decide to conduct the clinic ethnography in the specific ward or outpatient treatment facility, while also reaching out to relevant community or social support services (i.e. those that the patient or would-be care seeker is in contact with in relation to their care).

When appropriate, these settings can also be incorporated into the study by including the relevant care providers (e.g. informal carers, community health providers) working in this sphere as part of the study population.</p>\n<p>Your method of recruiting participants will depend on the aims of your project. Once your target group and eligibility criteria are identified, purposive sampling can be used to recruit participants that share the specific set of characteristics relevant to your study. Snowball sampling can then be applied if there is a large number of potential participants that are not easily identifiable.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Theoretical sampling is a sampling technique commonly used in grounded theory but also appropriate to ethnographic research. A form of purposive sampling, this strategy allows you to locate participants on the basis of identifying people and information that specifically pertain to conceptual questions and theoretical development (Miles and Huberman 1994). In a health setting, this may refer to recruiting participants who can help you answer specific questions about common themes and patterns of patients’ or providers’ experiences in the health facility, as demonstrated by the data you have already been collecting. For instance, you may find that patterns in your data indicate differences in how participants understand their own role as either patient or provider, or the role of the clinic in which they work or are visiting. Using theoretical sampling to develop the concept of how these roles might differ in alternate care settings (e.g. informal care received in the home or social support received by a community health network) may lead you to additional research sites with a new subset of potential participants.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Example 5: Theoretical sampling of maternal health service providers in rural Andean communities of Peru</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">In a study of community health workers (CHWs) providing maternal health care in Peru, participants were initially sought on the basis of their direct involvement with CHWs and rural maternal health services (e.g. women receiving pre-/post-natal care from CHWs, CHWs themselves, formal care providers visiting rural health posts). During analysis of CHW and health provider interviews, patterns of discrimination in the workplace began to emerge, specifically amongst lower level care providers who had previously been based in or received training from district level health facilities. A theoretical sample was then selected consisting of multiple cadres of health providers from the district level and not limited to maternal health care. Subsequent interviews were then held to explore emerging conceptualisations of discrimination as it was experienced between different cadres of health providers including CHWs, as well as between health providers and health seekers in district level health facilities (Vidal 2015).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

General principles of ethical research should be applied throughout the study. This includes following agreed upon procedures for obtaining informed consent and ensuring participant confidentiality and anonymity. Researchers must respect the dignity and values of their research participants. This requires being cognizant of cultural similarities and differences without passing judgement. Working in a clinical setting means the researcher may be privy to confidential or sensitive patient information. Some individuals may also have experienced, or currently experience, hardships or other forms of vulnerability. Therefore, researchers must clearly articulate to the research participants the aims of the study, the reasons they have been asked to participate, and any potential benefits or risks (or lack thereof) to their involvement. Participants should be provided with an information sheet and consent form (see Appendices 1 and 2) which clearly outline these and further details of the study and the participants’ rights (e.g. that their participation is voluntary, that they have the right to withdraw at any time).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

In a clinical setting, you will have a chance to interact with staff members and patients, both of whom will have very different perspectives of the issues at hand.</p>\n<p>There are several types of interviews that can vary in degree of structure. The two main types of interview are unstructured and semi-structured. Unstructured interviews may follow the format of a conversation. Though you may have a broad theme in mind during this type of interview, you will be open to pursue other themes depending on what the interviewee says. Semi-structured interviews include the use of a loosely structured topic guide made up of both closed and open-ended questions. This type of interview allows you to approach the interviewee with specific themes and questions in mind, also making use of probes to follow up on topics of interest pertinent to your research objectives. Note that the interview guide should not be used as a ‘questionnaire’; rather, it is a tool that gives you the freedom to adapt or probe on other topics as they come up.</p>\n<p>Interviewing staff members allows insight into aspects of health care provision and delivery. This includes individuals who belong to different cadres of care. All staff involved in patient care and support, such as medical, nursing and administrative staff, as well as any auxiliary staff and/or staff from referring departments and institutions if relevant, can be interviewed using a semi-structured topic guide (see Appendix 3). The focus of these interviews can range from exploring staff interactions and communication practices with patients to their perceptions on the challenges and barriers to service delivery and patient continuity of care.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Example 6: Conducting staff interviews at an outpatient tuberculosis (TB) clinic in Latvia</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">In a study conducted in 2017, Kielmann and colleagues (2018) used semi-structured interviews to investigate tuberculosis treatment adherence in Riga, Latvia. A total of 14 staff members were interviewed over two rounds. Staff members included in the first round of interviews were selected on the basis of their involvement with TB patient care and support (medical, nursing, administrative, and auxiliary) at the designated outpatient clinic as well as at three relevant referring departments and affiliated institutions. Six of these staff members were interviewed during a follow-up round. Their involvement in follow-up interviews was determined on the basis of their awareness and role in supporting the intervention related to the study. Follow-up interviews were not conducted with staff who were not directly involved, or had very limited roles in direct communication and care of patients initiated onto treatment during the intervention period.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>It is a good idea to include multiple cadres of staff in your participant group, while also differentiating between community-led, primary, secondary or tertiary care practitioners. This way you will be able to capture the experiences and opinions of people working within or with the designated clinic setting who are involved in patient care. For example, a medical receptionist at a primary care facility in charge of greeting and registering patients might have a very different yet equally valid account than a treating physician or a mental health nurse working in an inpatient facility.</p>\n<p>Interviews with patients can be conducted using a semi-structured topic guide (see Appendix 4) that covers aspects of their experience seeking and/or receiving care at the clinic/facility. This may include treatment initiation, care and support, communication with providers at each stage of treatment, as well as the broader familial and social context of their medicine/taking (or other aspects of care seeking) behaviour. A patient who is undergoing treatment for hypertension, for example, may be following a strict diet and exercise regime along with taking prescribed medication. Their treatment in this case extends into their home life where lifestyle factors may be related to or influenced by their family or broader environment.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Depending on the design and length of your study, you may choose to conduct more than one interview with each participant at different points in time. The first interview may for instance be at the start of the study, with a second interview occurring at the mid or end points. Iterative probing can be useful for collecting baseline data which you can then use to compare with data collected at later stages.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Observations</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Observations should be conducted at relevant points of the patients’ trajectory of care with a purposively selected set of staff and patients who have sought or initiated treatment during the study period (dependent on selection criteria). In qualitative research, observations can be structured, unstructured or falling somewhere in between. Unstructured observations may involve deciding on the setting of observation and taking detailed notes of everything you see. This can be useful during the formative stages of a study or if the topic of study is unfamiliar. Structured observations on the other hand, follow a pre-defined checklist of items. In clinical settings, both semi-structured and structured observations can be useful for assessing aspects of the quality of health services (Kielmann et al. 2011).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A semi-structured observation guide (Appendix 5), for instance, can be used to identify communication style, informational content and other aspects of patient and provider interactions (Wind 2008). In a health setting, this would normally include at least the following points: reception, initial meeting with a clinician or nurse, and consultation regarding treatment regime if applicable. Depending on the particular patient trajectory, other points of patient contact might include additional referring departments, outreach services or other home-based visits. Wind (2008) discusses some limitations and possibilities of observation in specialised healthcare settings.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Example 7: Selecting observation points at an outpatient TB clinic in Latvia</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">For their study, Kielmann et al. (2018) conducted brief observation sessions of 20 to 30 minutes in the DOT (direct observation treatment) room of the ambulatory clinic and the physician’s office where patients would go following their first diagnosis with TB. These points along the patient trajectory were selected according to relevant staff members’ availability to minimise disruption to clinic functions. There were two researchers present during each session who were then able to collate observation notes. During the second round of data collection, the researchers were invited to observe an outpatient DOT clinic for a period of two hours. These observations provided the researchers with an in-depth understanding of the use of clinic space, the implementation of direct observation as a care practice, and the interactions between DOT nurses and patients on treatment.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The observations should be recorded through notes that may include descriptive notes (providing rich detail on what is happening), analytical notes (beginning to interpret what you see by providing meaning and context) and reflective notes (providing insights on one’s own experience and feelings associated with ones presence in the field, and the process of data collection).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Patient case studies</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>You may wish to develop short narrative case studies where possible, for a select number of patients.

At the time of our second visit in March 2017, he had not missed any doses to date. Kaspars’ case illustrates the influence of previous experience with the healthsystem on treatment readiness.

In a health setting, mapping can be useful to locate clinics, doctors’ offices, hospitals and other important health or social service facilities which make up the ‘territory’ of the study population (Pelto 2016).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Example 9: Clinic map of TB and HIV services in South Africa</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In the MERGE trial (Kufa et al. 2014), researchers sought to understand how TB and HIV services might be better integrated in South African primary care clinics. Researchers asked health workers to draw clinic maps in order to visualise the spaces where TB and HIV care were being delivered, and the pathways that patients undertook to navigate these services (Figure 1)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Figure 1 [image]</em></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Infrastructural assessment</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Infrastructural assessment can be a valuable tool relevant to health care systems management. This approach views the role of health care facility infrastructure as a major component of the health care system. Full or rapid assessment is therefore conducted to measure the quality of all infrastructural components in health facilities. This assessment is dependent on the condition you are investigating. For instance, infrastructural assessments of TB services will be different from those of other illness services such as HIV or cancer care. See for example WHO (2008), which provides a useful operations manual of infrastructure considerations for health centres providing HIV services. Sholz et al. (2015) also provides a useful summary of different forms of assessment tools available in developing countries that consider facility infrastructure including ‘Service Availability and Readiness Assessment’ (SARA) and the ‘Health Center Assessment Handbook’ (Federal Ministry of Health, Ethiopia 2008).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Tracking patient pathways</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The patient pathway is the route a patient takes from their first point of contact with a health provider, leading to diagnosis, potential referral and completion of their treatment. Tracking patient pathways allows you to map the expected route of a patient’s care within a specified timeframe and setting (O'Brien et al. 2007). This can be approached through a review of patient records or other routinely collected data about the patients’ service usage.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Time-motion studies</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Time-motion studies can be used to capture information about time allocation and productivity. Since its development in the early 20th century within the industrial engineering field, the approach has been broadly adapted by biomedical researchers often focusing on clinical workflow related factors. There is however methodological variability in how previous studies have reported data and findings. Lopetegui et al. (2014) provide a detailed description of the distinct methods used in articles referencing time- motion studies. In a clinic ethnography, this approach can, for example, be applied to understand how different cadres of health workers use their time.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Example 10: Time-motion studies in Tanzania (Tani et al. 2016)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This study investigates this issue for paid community health agents trained for nine months in primary health care service delivery and deployed to villages as subjects of a randomized trial of their impact on childhood survival in three rural districts of Tanzania. To capture information about time allocation, 30 community health workers were observed during conventional working hours by research assistants for 5 days each over a period of 4 weeks. Results were presented in terms of percentage time allocation for direct client treatment, documentation activities, health education, health promotion non-work-related activities and personal activities.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Participatory techniques</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In contrast to the methods described thus far, participatory techniques aim to involve the participant as much as possible in the research process. By consulting and involving citizens over the course of developing and implementing studies, these techniques hope to improve quality, transparency, and accountability of research and its use in local communities. As Cornwall et al. (1995) state: “breaking the linear mould of conventional research, participatory research focuses on a process of sequential reflection and action, carried out with and by local people rather than on them...the key difference between participatory and conventional methodologies lies in the location of power in the research process”.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Participatory research has also been used with varying levels of success in ethnographic research. For example, action research, which uses new understandings of situations to develop new activities, can be used to link research back to a project’s plans (Tacchi et al. 2003). Photo-voice, a form of action research, is typically used to give ‘voice’ to marginalised populations by analysing photographs they take as part of a study (Burris and Wang 1997, Sutton-Brown 2014). Participant Ethnographic Evaluation and Research (PEER) is another strategy that has been used in situations where participants may not have established, or had time to establish, trust or rapport with the researchers, as may be a case in fragile or conflict-affected settings or other situations of vulnerability.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Example 11: Using PEER in South Sudan</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Elmusharaf et al. (2017) address how contextualized data can be collected in a short time and under conditions in which participants in conflict-affected zones might not trust external researchers. Through their use of PEER, they overcome a problem common to many ethnographic or participatory approaches: extended time and resources needed to develop trusting relationships with the community to understand the local context and the social networks they form. In their study, they trained South Sudanese marginalized women as PEER researchers to design research instruments, and collect and analyse qualitative data to assess barriers to maternal health care.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The authors list a number of steps required in the use of the PEER methodology, including the following:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1. Recruitment of PEER researchers,<br />2. Training of the PEER researchers,<br />3. Development of data collection instruments, 4. Data Collection,<br />5. De-briefing,<br />6. Insider interpretation,<br />7. Thematic data analysis.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Collecting field notes</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Taking field notes throughout data collection is recommended as it can help capture your thoughts and experiences about what is happening. This can be a good opportunity to reflect on anything that you find new, interesting or noteworthy, which you can later use to complement or expand upon data collected elsewhere (Kielmann et al. 2011). It is very important to train yourself and your research assistants and make a habit of taking notes from an early stage on in the project. Note-taking is not intuitive, but can be developed as a skill alongside using observation techniques to more fully describe the clinic and other settings one is immersed in.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

<p>Clinic ethnography is a qualitative approach based on ethnographic methods. Ethnography is a methodology popular in anthropological research, as well across the social sciences, designed to systematically study people and cultures. An ethnographic methodological approach is in-depth, flexible, iterative, participatory and focuses on understanding meaning in context. It is built on the premise of the researcher immersing him or herself into the social world of the participants in order to build trust, rapport and an ‘emic’, or insider’s, perspective of their lives.</p>
