This work has the potential to be used in acute and primary care settings to allow earlier diagnosis and improved quality of patient care for people with swallowing difficulties due to conditions such as stroke, Motor Neurone Disease, Parkinson’s, and head and neck cancers. This could lead to potential cost savings in medical care and improved quality of life for the patients and their carers.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Walking Fit-Ball</span><br />Loneliness is unfortunately all too common, especially among older men. Statistically, those most likely to get involved in social clubs to form connections in later life are women, leaving many men struggling with isolation. Walking Fit-Ball is an intergenerational social project at QMU to get older men meeting one another, improving their physical health, and forming friendships. The project mixes men over 60 from the local community with QMU students to play a less physically demanding version of the beautiful game.</p>

<p><span class="lead">'The Green' - augmented reality in performance</span><br />The Green is a performance research project exploring the multifarious historical, archival and community narratives of Glasgow Green, the UK’s oldest public park. This project used interviews, artistic experimentation and community events to explore what Glasgow Green means to the city, and how it can be performed.</p>
<p>The narratives gathered for The Green were developed into a free augmented reality app in collaboration with the University of St. Andrews. The app can be downloaded and deployed at the park, and functions as an accessible space for alternative and underrepresented histories to be shared and celebrated.</p>
