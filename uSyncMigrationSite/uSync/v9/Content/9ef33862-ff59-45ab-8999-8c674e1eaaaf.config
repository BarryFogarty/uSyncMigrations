<ul>
<li><strong>Unique in Scotland:</strong> Our degree continues to be the first in Scotland to have Public Sociology as our underpinning ethos and practice.</li>

<li><strong>Dynamic learning environment:</strong> We engage our students in a wide range of learning experiences which are intellectually stimulating and personally empowering, ranging from traditional lectures, small seminar and study groups, to opportunities for work-based learning and community engagement experiences.  </li>
<li><strong>Support for students:</strong> Our class sizes are smaller compared with some universities, so you have closer and more individually tailored support and guidance from our staff.</li>

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Our BSc (Hons) in Sociology is ideal preparation for a wide range of careers in which you can contribute to improving people’s lives. </span></p>
<p>In sociology, our focus is on understanding how people’s lives and interactions are shaped by factors like class, gender, ethnicity, race, disability and age in national and global contexts. Sociologists interpret and explain how social processes and institutions inform and impact people’s everyday lives.</p>
<p>Throughout your degree, you will have opportunities to study a broad range of topics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>examining how, where, when and why social inequalities and divisions arise;</li>
<li>considering ways in which we can challenge, understand and overcome social problems and ethical dilemmas through public policy and social action;</li>
<li>interpreting the relationship between identity, community and society, locally and globally; and</li>
<li>conducting research into real world issues, as well as making concrete recommendations for social change.</li>
