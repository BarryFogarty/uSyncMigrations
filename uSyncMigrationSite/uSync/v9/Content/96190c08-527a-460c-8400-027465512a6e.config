    "content": "<p>I trained as a Physiotherapist at QMU between 1994 and 1998. On completing this I decided that my heart lay in research. I studied for my PhD between 1998 and 2002, conducting a mixed methods study that focused on young women and their behaviours, experiences, and personal meanings and feelings relating to exercise and physical activity. I worked clinically after completing my PhD but soon moved into research again through conducting a needs assessment of lymphedema services in Fife. This led me to interest in using audit, service evaluation and research to advocate for people who are living with different long-term health conditions and for the people in their lives – families and informal carers. I have worked with people living with the impacts of breast cancer and its treatment, lymphedema, stroke, multiple sclerosis and renal disease. I take a pragmatic approach and use quantitative and qualitative methodologies as appropriate to ask and answer questions from different perspectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Affiliations/Memberships to Other Organisations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Member of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy</li>\n<li>Registered with the Health and Care Professions Council</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Professional Social Media:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine_Bulley\">Research Gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathy-bulley-6548a761\">Linkedin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research/Knowledge Exchange Centre Membership:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Full member of the <a data-id=\"1266\" href=\"/{localLink:1266}\" title=\"Centre for Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research\">Centre for Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research </a></span></li>\n</ul>"
