      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">And did the course live up to your expectations? </span><br />It did. It was something very new - there isn't a programme like this in Greece. In Greece, there is a belief that having a UK degree is important as it is something that allows you to go abroad and work internationally.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you feel connected to Queen Margaret University? </span><br />I felt that because the course was delivered to the same standard as it is in the UK, it made me feel as if I was there. You do the course in the same way as students at Queen Margaret University would do, but you do it in your language. Everything else is the same. I hope to visit Scotland at some point when I'm working in the UK!</p>
<p><span class="lead">You were very busy during your studies, did you feel that you were supported? </span><br />When I first joined this programme, I had the opportunity to work at Funky Gourmet - a Michelin star restaurant - they liked me, and I stayed there until January before it was closed for its relocation to Athens in 2020. After that, in May 2019, I went to London for two months to work in a restaurant in Vauxhall before coming back to work on an event in Costa Navarino. It's one of the biggest hotels in Greece, and I went there with five other people from my team for one and a half months. So there were a few times when I needed help, but I always felt supported by my colleagues and teachers. There was career advice available too.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you think that there was the right balance between theory and practice on the course?</span><br />If you want to be a great chef, it's not just about the cooking. Things like management, marketing and economics are also significant. I feel that the programme helped me a lot, it helped me make the transition from becoming a cook to becoming a chef.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Was there anything that you didn't like about the course? </span><br />It was maybe a bit difficult at the beginning, mainly because of coming on to a UK course after studying at a local institution. Still, I became comfortable with the course content and the teaching quite quickly.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What are your plans for the future?</span></p>
<p>My first goal is to work in as many of the top 50 restaurants in the world as I can! I would have to travel a lot, but it would give me a lot of experience that I could maybe use to open my own restaurant one day, which will hopefully have at least one Michelin star. I'd like it to be a farm-to-table restaurant as I feel that it is the future.</p>]]></Value>

<p><span class="lead">What attracted you to study at Queen Margaret University?</span><br />I already had a degree in Culinary Arts from a local institution, but I wanted to do something a bit different, something that would help me evolve and be a great chef! I did a lot of research, and I found out about the course that was offered by Queen Margaret and learned that the University had many years of experience, especially in Culinary Arts.</p>]]></Value>
