    "content": "<p>This course is about more than simply preparing you to inspire a class of young learners; it will engage you in the wider socio-political issues that affect education on every level and how this in turn influences educational outcomes for children. You will study contemporary issues in education, psychology and sociology to develop a sound knowledge base of children’s developmental pathways and the range of factors that affect them. You will gain an understanding of how pedagogic theory and knowledge informs classroom practices at early years and primary school level. By developing a detailed knowledge of all areas of the curriculum, including outdoor learning, you will become skilful at integrating literacy, numeracy and wellbeing throughout your teaching.</p>\n<p>Through practical experience in educational and community settings you will learn how to build positive relationships with children and work alongside other professionals. Our education courses draw on our expertise in, and focus on, wellbeing, resilience, child welfare and inequality. You will learn how to assess individual needs and plan inclusive learning experiences taking account of diversity and difference.</p>\n<p>Over the four years you will develop your academic literacies including digital and data literacy. You will develop research skills to enable you to develop as an autonomous, critically thinking, reflective professional.<br />This is a fresh, modern and ambitious approach to teacher education. We hope you feel as passionate about this new direction as we do and look forward to receiving your application. At QMU we are committed to widening access to education and we welcome applications from all backgrounds and genders.</p>"
