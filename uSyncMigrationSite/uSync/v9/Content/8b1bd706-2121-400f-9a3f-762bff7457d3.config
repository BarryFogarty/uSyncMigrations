<li><strong>Workplace experience:</strong> All of our Business Management routes include workplace experience.</li>
<li><strong>Gain great industry insights and contacts:</strong> Through our strong industry links, you will gain insights into high-profile companies. Representatives of companies such as Bacardi, Social Bite, Skyscanner, Google and Edinburgh Airport have joined us as visiting speakers recently.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent support from staff:</strong> Smaller than average class sizes mean you will get close support and guidance from staff who get to know you. We will help you develop your passion, ranging from supporting student start-ups in our Business Innovation Zone (BIZ) to helping you pick the right dissertation or consultancy project to kickstart your career.</li>
<li><strong>Staff expertise:</strong> You will be taught by staff who are active researchers, and who share the latest research insights in their teaching ensuring that, as a future leader, you are at the forefront of the latest developments in business and management areas.</li>
<li><strong>Stimulating learning environment:</strong> Benefit from a variety of learning experiences such as lectures, seminars, workshops, field trips, exchanges**, guest lectures from a range of practitioners and visiting professors.

</ul>
<p><strong>The course in brief</strong></p>
<p>Let’s talk business. When you study for a degree in Business Management at QMU you will gain a deep understanding of the nature and core functions of businesses. How do successful companies manage their resources? What is the best way to make an organisation environmentally sustainable? What marks out a successful business?<br />People do business with people. If you have first-class management skills and practical expertise, people are going to want to work with you. Our Business Management degree routes are designed to give you the knowledge and skills that you need to thrive in the fast-moving marketplaces of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>What you will gain from this course<br /></strong></p>
<p>On our BA/BA (Hons) Business Management you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain a solid foundation in the core principles of business management, including marketing, human resource management, finance, economics, digital business, strategy, law, and operations management.</li>
<li>Hone your practical business expertise with placements, guest speakers and project opportunities.</li>
<li>Choose electives from a range of modules on offer. You will gain the maximum possible flexibility in Years Three and Four by being able to select modules from any of the specialised routes for your electives.</li>
<li>Have the opportunity to apply for an exchange at a university overseas in North America, Canada, Europe or Australia**.</li>
<li>Gain a degree that has a strong focus on employability, supporting you to develop your project management, problem solving, communication, innovation and other transferable skills valued by employers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flexible routes</strong></p>
<p>We offer the following five business management routes:</p>
<p>• BA/BA (Hons) Business Management<br />• BA/BA (Hons) Business Management with Analytics<br />• BA/BA (Hons) Business Management with Digital Marketing<br />• BA/BA (Hons) Business Management with Finance<br />• BA/BA (Hons) Business Management with Human Resource Management</p>
<p>All students enrol on our general Business Management degree for Years One and Two which will give you a solid foundation in the core principles of business management. At the end of Year Two we’ll discuss the route options with you and help you make you decide whether to stay on our general Business Management degree for maximum flexibility or, if you want to, you can move onto one of our named routes. This will allow you to graduate with a specialist award, for example: BA (Hons) Business Management with Analytics.</p>
<p>Whichever business management path you take, you will be equipped with the skills employers are looking for, negotiation, project management, problem solving, critical thinking and team working.</p>
