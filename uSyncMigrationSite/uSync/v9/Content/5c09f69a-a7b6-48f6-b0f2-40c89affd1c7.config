<p class="x_MsoNormal">The researchers asked the question:<span> </span>What transformational reform programmes have been introduced to enhance the delivery of children’s social work services through closer working with health and/or adult social care services in the case study countries, and what has been the impact of these on children, families, services and practice?     <span> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Six case studies were selected to see what<span> </span><span class="x_normaltextrun"><span class="x_ContentPasted0">key learning there is for Scotland:<span> </span></span></span>five<span class="x_normaltextrun"><span class="x_ContentPasted0"><span> examining a range of approaches to the delivery of children’s services, from national to highly decentralised structures and modes of delivery, in five high-income countries - Finland, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland - and a sixth case study to draw on learning from Scotland’s experiences of national service reorganisation through the development of </span></span><span class="x_ContentPasted0">Police Scotland</span><span class="x_ContentPasted0">.<span> </span></span> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The researchers identified common push and pull factors behind the rationales and aspirations for the reforms. They found that for the implementation of transformational reform programmes:<span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Implementation is a prolonged, complex and challenging process; </p>
<ul>
<li>Transformational reform programmes require transformational leadership;<span> </span></li>
<li>A conducive and settled domestic environment is required; and<span> </span><span> </span></li>
<li>Successful implementation needs strong foundations.<span> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The diverse reform programmes were found to have been used to bring about integrated children's health and social care systems and identified that despite the differences in approach:<span> </span> </p>
<ul>
<li>There were commonalities in the structures and functions present at the national, regional, local and locality levels.<span> </span></li>
<li>Strong national leadership and investment is required for the design and implementation of transformational reform.<span> </span></li>
<li>The locality level is the main setting for integrated working.<span> </span></li>
<li>Continued attention needs to be paid to the interfaces between services.<span class="x_ContentPasted0"> <span> </span> </span></li>
<li>Continued attention needs to be paid to workforce recruitment and retention.<span> </span><span> </span></li>
<li>Wider policy agendas influence - and must be influenced by - the experiences of children and families.<span> </span></li>
<li>Integrated children's health and social care systems require a range of features to be in place.<span> </span><span> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Dr Heather Ottaway, CELCIS’s Head of Evidence and Innovation, who is leading the research, said:<span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Each of these case studies was selected as the set of structural reforms have led to different models of delivery. By understanding the rationales, experiences, and outcomes, of each of these transformational reform programmes, these collectively offer us the opportunity to learn from and apply what has worked in other countries and settings and, equally, to understand what has not worked.  <span> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">“Looking at these case studies of reform programmes is one contribution to this study’s process of identifying what is already known and what we need to understand in the future to inform decision-making.”<span> </span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Chair of the research’s independent steering group, Professor Brigid Daniel, Professor Emerita at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, said:<span> </span></p>

<li>Case study research is an investigation and analysis of single or multiple examples of something to explore and understand the object of study. To help ensure the findings are grounded on real experience, the case study would need to have engaged in, or was in the process of engaging in, a transformational reform programme. The case studies selected are broadly geographically comparable to Scotland, for example in relation to population size, urban-rural geography, and socio-economic strengths and challenges, so that there is increased opportunity for Scotland to learn from and potentially apply some of the findings from the case study. <em><span> </span></em><span></span><span></span></li>
