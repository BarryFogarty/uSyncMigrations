      <Value><![CDATA[<p>According to research carried out by Nuclear Operations, at EDF Energy, one third of schoolgirls in Scotland think they are “not clever” enough and careers in STEM are more suited to boys. However, the research estimates that by 2020, the economy in Scotland will need an extra 2,000 university graduates with a STEM background to fill upcoming roles.</p>

<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Notes to News Editors</strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The TEV Project (Tracked Electric Vehicles), is a solution designed to advance road infrastructure and the way people travel.   </p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Electric cars and fleet vehicles will drive on a pre-fabricated, dedicated lane under full automatic control. This will allow passengers to travel safely at high speeds which, in turn, will enable vastly greater passenger carrying capacities compared with traditional motorways. </p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Developed by open-source as a social enterprise, the TEV Project is the vision of Will Jones, a respected inventor, an expert in battery design and founder of Philadelphia Scientific, a leading provider of products and services for industrial batteries and their infrastructure, operating from North America, Europe, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Caroline Jones-Carrick, Project Director, was born and raised in the USA before moving to Scotland. After more than a decade working in communications for urban regeneration and construction projects, Caroline co-founded the TEV Project with her father Will.</p>
