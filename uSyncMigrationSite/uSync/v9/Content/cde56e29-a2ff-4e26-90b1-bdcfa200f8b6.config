    "content": "<p>I have a sophisticated understanding of research design and methodologies. This expertise has offered significant opportunities for collaborative working with academics and researchers at QMU in other HEIs. I am also member of the QMU Research Strategy Committee, which is responsible for the development and implementation of the QMU research strategy as well as a member of the Master in Clinical Research (MRes) team. The MRes is a highly innovative award designed to deliver the criteria in the Vitae framework for people who aspire to criteria for recognition, such as a Senior Fellow of HEA.</p>\n<p>My activities extend beyond collaboration within QMU, to external collaboration with the universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Heriot-Watt. My collaboration with the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) has led to a study exploring the links between preterm birth, socio-economic variables and educational outcomes. The scope and impact of this large cohort study (32,000 participants) have been reviewed and endorsed by the SLS, and the project will commence in summer 2016.</p>\n<p>I represent the Division of OT &amp; ATs in the recently launched Graduate School Academic Board, and I play an instrumental role in maximizing the quality of the doctorate student experience, and promoting an inclusive and interdisciplinary research environment for doctorate students through reviewing research proposals, and partaking in decision making in relation to progression and examination outcomes. I have been involved in doctorate supervision for over four years, have one doctorate completion and I am currently involved in supervising two doctorate students. I have, for the past few years, also been delivering research seminars at the Welcome Trust Clinical Research Facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Affiliations/Memberships to Other Organisations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Member of the Graduate School Academic Board: the Board is responsible for maximizing the quality of the doctorate student experience and promoting an inclusive and interdisciplinary research environment for PhD and Professional Doctorate students</li>\n<li>Member of the QMU Research Strategy Committee: the Committee is responsible for the development and implementation of the QMU research strategy</li>\n<li>Elected member of Senate at QMU</li>\n<li>Masters in Clinical Research; School of Health Sciences (member of the validation and teaching team)</li>\n<li>Board of examiners, Ulster University, Belfast 2014-2017 External examiner</li>\n<li>Instructor/Visiting lecturer, Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility The University of Edinburgh: Courses: An Introduction to Mixed Methods Research and An Introduction to Qualitative Research Methods: A 3-day seminar (yearly since 2014)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Research/Knowledge Exchange Centre Membership:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full member of <a data-id=\"1269\" href=\"/{localLink:1269}\" title=\"Centre for Person-centred Practice Research\">Centre for Person-centred Practice Research</a></li>\n<li>Associate member of <a data-id=\"1265\" href=\"/{localLink:1265}\" title=\"Centre for Applied Social Sciences\">Centre for Applied Social Sciences </a></li>\n</ul>"
