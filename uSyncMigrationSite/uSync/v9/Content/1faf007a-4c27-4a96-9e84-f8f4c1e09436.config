      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This is a podcast focusing on the experiences of people with Long Covid. I am Cathy Bulley and I am a Professor at Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh. We know from our research that it can be very difficult to feel understood and to find help for Long Covid. Some people who have expertise working as health professionals are also experiencing life with Long Covid – we have asked if they will share some of their problem-solving and advice with you.</p>
<p><br />We are aware that people living with Long Covid often have difficulties processing too much information at once, so we have created a series of short recordings – each lasts about six to twelve minutes. We also aim to make a transcript of each available. Some recordings make reference to specific resources and we will make the links to these available on our website.</p>
