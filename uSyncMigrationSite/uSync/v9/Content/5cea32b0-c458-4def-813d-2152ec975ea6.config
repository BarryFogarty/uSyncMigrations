      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong><span>Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh/Scotland?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>“I chose to do a degree in Scotland because I wanted to study in an English speaking country and find a course that offered more practical experience. </span></p>
<p><span>“Edinburgh is a very lively city. There is always something new happening here. I’ve enjoyed visiting the different sights, including Arthur’s Seat, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Inverleith Park, Leith Walk and the Christmas markets.</span></p>
<p><span>“QMU is close to Edinburgh International Airport. As an international student, this is really important for me.</span></p>
<p><span>“I was also fortunate to have my costs paid by the Student Awards Agency For Scotland (SAAS).”  </span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to study this course QMU?</strong></p>
<p><span>“I chose the course because I wanted to do something creative, so I was looking for a marketing degree. I was glad to find that QMU had not just a simple general marketing degree, but it also included public relations and events modules. So, I also chose this course because it meant more future career options and paths. This was very important for me because I was not sure what to do after finishing university. </span></p>
<p><span>“In addition to the course, which weighed a lot in my final decision, I chose QMU because it looked really modern, including computers, communication with lecturers via email and the library facilities."</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Do you enjoy living in the QMU student accommodation on campus?  </span></strong></p>
<p>“I’ve been living in QMU student accommodation for the past three years and there is a big chance I will be here next year as well.</p>
<p><span>“I think accommodation on campus has two plus points: being so close to the main QMU academic building, as well as the fact that I have my own room with bathroom. Besides this, I would add the fact that there is always someone you can go if you have an accommodation issue. For example, if you need something repaired or replaced, accommodation services will solve it for you at no additional cost.</span></p>
<p><span>“The University and Students’ Union services sounded appealing too, as well as the variety of sports clubs and societies available.” </span></p>
<p><strong><span>What has been the highlight of the course so far? </span></strong></p>
<p><span>“In my opinion, the most interesting part of my course is the practical part. I get a lot of assignments where I have to come up with material based on what I’m learning and I really enjoy this aspect. For example, for marketing I had to create a website based on a marketing-related topic and for public relations I had to create a campaign.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What is your top tip for future students who might be interested in this course?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>“Be organised. The course is very busy and you have a lot of individual work and team projects to do, so I believe it’s important to organise your time and activities wisely in order to do a good job and learn many new interesting things.</span></p>
<p><span>“At the same time, make the most of your student life. Go to sports and societies, volunteer, go sightseeing, go to events, hang out with your friends and make new friends. </span></p>
<p><span>“I recently became a QMU Student Ambassador, which means I help at QMU events, such as campus tours, school visits or the Queen Margaret Children’s University. I also volunteer at University events organised by QMU student volunteers, as well as volunteering with external organisations like Girlguiding.”</span></p>
