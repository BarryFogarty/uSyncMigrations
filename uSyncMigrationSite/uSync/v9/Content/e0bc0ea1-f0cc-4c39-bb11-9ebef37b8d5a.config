      <Value><![CDATA[<p>From 1 October 2022, UK employers are no longer able to use the temporary Covid-adjusted right to work guidance. This means that QMU is no longer able to ask new employees and casual workers to share a scanned copy or photo of their documents and then confirm their identity over a video call.</p>
<p>Instead, we are required to resume pre-pandemic methods of check. In order to support the University to carry out the required checks as efficiently as possible, we are working with an Identity Service Provider (IDSP) called Amiqus.</p>

    "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\">What is an IDSP?</span><br />An identity service provider (IDSP) is a provider of ID verification services. They are certified to provide ID verification to specific levels of confidence, specified by government standards. IDSPs are sometimes referred to as 'identity providers'. We are working with Amiqus, who are a government recommended IDSP.<br /><br /><span class=\"lead\">Who has access to Amiqus and where can I find further information?</span><br />Only the HR team have access to Amiqus. Further information about the system can be found on the <a href=\"https://amiqus.co/right-to-work\" title=\"Amiqus Website\">Amiqus website</a>.<br /><br /><span class=\"lead\">Is Amiqus compliant with GDPR?</span><br />Yes. The University is still the data controller, Amiqus fulfil the role of data processor and we have a <a href=\"https://amiqus.co/policies/terms/data-processing-agreement\" title=\"Amiqus Data Processing Agreement\">Data Processing Agreement</a> in place with Amiqus. Our Worker Privacy notice has been updated.<br /><br /><span class=\"lead\">What does this mean for British and Irish citizens?</span><br />We will use Amiqus to carry out the right to work check prior to the start date of employment or engagement.<br /><br />The new staff member or casual worker will be sent a request via Amiqus to carry out a right to work check. Amiqus will use specialist software to verify the right to work documentation. There is no requirement for the new staff member or casual worker to send original identification by post. A further identity check will be carried out either face to face or via Teams on the first day of employment or engagement to verify that the ID provided matches the person who has presented themselves for work.<br /><br /><span class=\"lead\">What does this mean for those that don’t have a British or Irish Passport?</span><br />Right to work check for those that do not have a British or Irish Passport are conducted via the Home office online check. Amiqus can be used to gather the information required for the Home Office online check i.e. provision of a share code. They do not need to send their original documents to us by post.</p>\n<p><br /><span class=\"lead\">Can manual right to work checks still be carried out?</span><br />Yes. Although we have Amiqus a manual face to face check can still be carried out if this is more convenient. Information on how to carry out manual checks is provided below.<br /><br /><span class=\"lead\">Who is responsible for carrying out a right to work check?</span><br />HR is responsible for carrying out the right to work check however manual checks can be carried out by a line manager and/engager. Where a check is carried out by someone out with HR the person completing the check must be confident that they have carried out the check in accordance with the UKVI requirements and provide the evidence of the check to HR for the individual’s record.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Why is an identity check required when right to work has been confirmed?</span><br />The UKVI rules require the employer to verify that the person who presents themselves for work is consistent with the ID documentation provided for the right to work check. This check can be carried our either face to face or via Teams.</p>\n<p><br /><span class=\"lead\">What about those that do not have the right to work in the UK?</span><br />Following the UK Leaving the EU, a new immigration system was introduced on 1 January 2021. This applies to new members of staff entering the UK if they are a: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-UK/Irish national, who do not already have a visa which allows them to work in the UK eg: \n<ul>\n<li>EEA/Swiss nationals who were not resident in the UK before 31 December 2020</li>\n<li>Nationals from non-European countries. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From 1 July 2021 EEA/Swiss nationals must present either a status through the EU Settlement Scheme or a visa through the immigration system.<br /><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971253/6.7209_HO_Right_to_Work_leaflet__PBS__V14.pdf\" title=\"EEA/Swiss Citizen Right to Work (Government Information PDF)\">Further information about right to work for EEA/Swiss citizens is available from the government website (External PDF)</a>.</p>"

It is vital that three step approach be conducted prior to the engagement of an applicant or casual worker.

It is equally important that copies of relevant documents are secured in a timely manner and submitted to HR for verification.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtain: You must see the applicant’s original documents.</li>\n<li>Check: You must check that the documents are valid <strong>with</strong> the applicant physically present.</li>\n<li>Copy: You must make and keep copies of the documents and record the date you made the checks. The date must be recorded ad follows, “the date on which this right to work check was made: [insert date]”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simply writing a date on the copy document does not confirm that this is the actual date when the check was undertaken.

The individual will need to produce a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work\" title=\"Share Code\">share code</a> to allow you to access their online record.</p>\n<p><br />The HR team have developed a check list which they use for every new staff member or worker on a casual engagement to record the type of check undertaken and confirm the details. The checklist must be completed for every new staff member and casual worker.</p>"
