This new programme offers an ideal solution so you can benefit from a balanced blended teaching programme which is given partly on location and partly by innovative distance learning methods.</p>
<p><strong>What is a blended learning MSc Global Health?</strong></p>
<p> The Erasmus+ blended master's programme is a one year full-time programme that requires you to be away from home for only 3 months. It consists of three months (September- December 2017) of core modules at QMU after which further modules and a thesis are completed through online learning at the three participating institutes in Scotland, Norway and the Netherlands.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this programme for?</strong></p>
<p>If you are a health professional (for example medical doctor, nurse or a midwife) or have a social science background and you want to develop your career in the field of global health, then this programme is designed for you.</p>
<p><strong>Special focus for 2017: Conflict and Health</strong></p>
<p>Semester Two of the Erasmus+ MSc Global Health at QMU has a special focus on conflict and health. Building on the core modules of global health, the second semester provides an in-depth analysis of the current challenges and policy debates in responses to meeting the health needs of populations affected by instability and conflict. In countries affected by political and social conflict health and wellbeing of displaced and vulnerable populations are at high risk.</p>

Different approaches in coding and analysis of data obtained from qualitative research will be demonstrated and practiced in exercises. The strengths and weaknesses of qualitative research approaches will be discussed. The course includes both taught and practice sessions. Students will design a mini research project and will apply qualitative methods in a fieldwork research exercise.</p>\n<p>The course content is similar to the face to face module that can be found under: <a href=\"http://www.troped.org/courses/SPT--FullRecord.php?ResourceId=85\">http://www.troped.org/courses/SPT--FullRecord.php?ResourceId=85</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Queen Margaret University:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rebuilding Health Systems – Analysing the challenges in disrupted states (e-learning)</strong></p>\n<p>Rebuilding health systems following conflict raises significant challenges to meeting the urgent health needs of the population.
