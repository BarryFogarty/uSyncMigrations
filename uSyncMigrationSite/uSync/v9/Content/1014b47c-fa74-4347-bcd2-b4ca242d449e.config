    "content": "<p>Carola is an experienced researcher on child protection issues, mental health and psychosocial wellbeing in low and middle-income countries with over 25 years of work experience. She has particular experience of working in fragile states and conflict-affected contexts and has conducted numerous research, evaluation and teaching assignments in such contexts. She has a strong interest in resilience and local strategies for dealing with adversities and has worked with community-based organisations seeking to promote such approaches to social development issues.</p>\n<p>She holds a postgraduate degree in psychology from the University of Cape Town and conducted her doctoral work on the psychosocial wellbeing of displaced people in Angola. A multi-disciplinary approach has characterised much of her research approach as she believes that spanning different disciplines allows us to gain deeper understanding of the interrelated issues that people face in challenging settings.</p>\n<p>Increasingly she has worked on understanding ways in which children who are facing adversity can be supported through community-based strategies, and ways of ending violence perpetrated against children. As social norms are central to how children (and adults) are treated, she continues to investigate how these can be transformed in ways that protect rather than harm children. Recent research has focused on the role of local faith actors in influencing social norm change at community level.</p>\n<p>She has focused much of her career on work in Sub-Saharan Africa but also has experience in countries such as Sri Lanka, Guatemala, Afghanistan and parts of eastern Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>Research/Knowledge Exchange Centre Membership:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a data-id=\"1270\" href=\"/{localLink:1270}\" title=\"Institute for Global Health and Development\">Institute for Global Health and Development</a></li>\n</ul>"

Community-based approaches to changing attitudes, social norms and practices from a grassroots perspective are an important component of this, as well as engagement with faith-based communities on strengthening child protection systems in local settings. Recent work in Malawi, Senegal, Uganda and Guatemala was focused on researching the impact of such community-based strategies to address childhood adversity.</p>\n<p><br />The role of religion and faith in humanitarian development contexts as both a mechanisms for perpetuating as well as a resource for challenging violence and promoting wellbeing is a further research focus. Global mental health and psychosocial wellbeing are further research overviews on which she continues to conduct research.</p>\n<p><strong>Active research interests: </strong><br />• Child protection issues within low-income settings <br />• Psychosocial wellbeing and mental health in fragile settings <br />• Global mental health: stigma, strategies for improving services and support<br />• Social norm changes in relation to ending violence against children<br />• Role of religion and spiritual resources in social development contexts <br />• Evaluation methodologies for interventions focused on psychosocial issues and child protection</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Research Methods:</strong><br />• Mixed methodologies<br />• Qualitative methods<br />• Ethnographic methods<br />• Participatory methods<br />• Research with children<br />• Survey design</p>"

This three-year study is aimed at identifying the mechanisms that promote or hinder pro-child protection processes form taking place at community level, with an analysis of changes in knowledge, attitudes, practice and religious reflection on the issues that make children’s lives difficult. This study started in 2016 and will continue until 2021, examining how the initiative with faith actors functions in Muslim, Christian and interfaith contexts.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Innovative e-learning &amp; teaching through strategic partnerships in Global Health Education (EU Erasmus+)</strong></p>\n<p>She is the lead on this innovative course development project. Working with The University of Bergen, Norway and KIT in The Netherlands, IGHD is developing a unique MSc Global Health programme, where students only have to be on site for 3 months rather than a full year, with the rest of the course delivered online. This is an opportunity for students to gain a Masters degree by studying with three leading European Universities in the field of global health in an initiative that, as well as providing a firm grounding in theory and policy, will enhance employability by equipping participants with key skills for implementing global health programmes.   <strong>                                                        </strong></p>"
