Assessment strategies will encourage application to practice. This will be achieved through the use of varied strategies that draw on the student’s own areas of practice such as portfolio development, practice proposals, annotated bibliographies, simulation events, games, seminar presentations and self-determined contextual assignment topics. Tutor, peer and self-assessment, including within virtual environments (eg HUB@QMU), will be an important component of approaches to formative and summative assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement</strong></p>\n<p>The course is 50% practice-based and requires placement in an approved practice. To support learners in their practice learning environment they will be assigned to a Practice Supervisor and a Practice Assessor. Placement will be negotiated with your supporting NHS area.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>The PgDip Person-Centred Practice (Health Visiting) is an NMC validated course leading to the Specialist Community Public Health Nurse Qualification, and therefore the hours for theory and practice are stipulated by the NMC.
