Peer teaching is enabled through the use of seminar presentations, and collaborative devising or workshop generation processes. Students are encouraged to be enquiring, critical and innovative. In addition, students also initiate and lead individual tutorials/workshops with members of staff related to coursework or dissertation supervision.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Students are offered the opportunity for industry-based learning through placement opportunities in modules marked ‘*’ (see 'What will I learn in each year' tab) and also if they elect to take Experiential Learning Placement.</p>\n<p>Industry-based learning can occur in a diversity of areas (community and youth theatre organisations, schools, arts organisations, charities and community groups). Our links with external stakeholders continue to grow and develop. Examples of placement opportunities range from the Edinburgh International Festival to working with independent theatre companies or the Brunton or Lyceum theatres as well as a range of local primary and secondary schools. The mix of student placements is very diverse and we aim to accommodate all student aspirations.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
