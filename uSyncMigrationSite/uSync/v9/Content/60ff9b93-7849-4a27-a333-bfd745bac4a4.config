    "content": "<p>As a nurse, you will be at the forefront of healthcare, meeting a broad range of people who truly need your expertise and empathy. Nurses are involved in promoting health and preventing illness in addition to caring for sick and dying people. This can take place in a variety of environments, which include health centres, homes, residential/care homes and hospitals. A career in nursing can take you into leadership and management, education and research, both at home and overseas. Wherever you choose to specialise in the future, as a nurse you will be an advocate for the people in your care. You will make a difference.</p>\n<p>The course content is aligned to both the <a href=\"https://www.nmc.org.uk/\" title=\"Nursing and Midwifery Council\">Nursing and Midwifery Council</a> (NMC) Standards for Future Nurse Education and the Person-centred Framework for Nursing (McCormack and McCance, 2019). We therefore focus our learning units on parts of the framework which are: Metaparadigms, Pre-requisites, Care Environment and Person-centred Processes. These themes are developed across the four years and include group learning within a learning set and this is where you will build a personal portfolio of your learning in practice and in university.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>be able to register with the NMC and practise as a nurse;</li>\n<li>be able to confidently deliver safe, effective and person-centred nursing care;</li>\n<li>become part of a community of learners, working collaboratively with lecturers, clinical staff, service users and other students on a transformational journey towards registration;</li>\n<li>actively engage in creative and critical ways of working and learning including approaches such as critical inquiry, reflection, contemplation, simulation and practice learning experiences; and</li>\n<li>carry out invaluable practice learning experiences (PLEs) that will enrich your learning.</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>This is a four year integrated undergraduate master’s course. Students start the course with a view to graduating with a Master of Nursing (MNurse) in four years and the eligibility to apply for registration with the NMC. There is an option for students to choose a BSc (Hons) route at the end of Year Two and they will still be eligible to apply for registration with the NMC as a nurse as soon as they graduate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Our aim in developing this course has been to use a range of creative ways of teaching and learning to promote self-development and the skills for interacting with others. You will be facilitated to learn in lectures, seminars, practical laboratories and have practice learning experiences. Outside of timetabled sessions, you will be expected to continue learning through self-study.</p>\n<p>We aim to include creative ways of assessment that may involve student choice. Assessments include practical and written exams, assignments and group work.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements (Practice Learning Experience)</strong></p>\n<p>A Practice Learning Experience (PLE) is offered each year. PLEs provide the opportunity to integrate theory and practice by working directly with people in whichever setting they are.</p>\n<p>PLEs can be in a variety of settings such as the community area, a hospital or care home. These may be in the Lothians and Borders. Edinburgh Napier University manages the sourcing of PLEs for each student on this course. Lecturing staff at QMU manage the allocation of PLEs for each student.</p>\n<p>The teams are always looking at widening opportunities for students and we are increasing the variety of available PLEs all the time. Opportunities to work with specialist research nurses are being developed.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employablity PLEs take place across across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location. </p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>There are no specific exchange PLEs available within the course, however, we promote available opportunities to students and these may include exchanges for a limited number of students and also volunteering opportunities which can be done in the summer break. </p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
