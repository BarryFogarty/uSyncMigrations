<p><strong>Plagiarism and the use of the ‘Turnitin Plagiarism Checker Tool’</strong></p>
<p>Plagiarism occurs when someone copies or reproduces another person’s words or ideas and presents them as their own with no proper acknowledgement via citation and referencing. In various universities students (and staff) have been heavily penalised where they have been found to have done this. To ensure that you are not at risk of being accused of plagiarism you must always declare all the sources from which you have obtained material or ideas.</p>
<p>QMU provides an academic resource called Turnitin to allow students to consider how they use secondary literature – this includes material from the internet, journals magazines, books and any other form of printed material. This enables you to check your own work for evidence of poor academic practice. It is your responsibility to engage with the Turnitin Plagiarism Checker Tool, which is located in the Hub site for your short course under the <a href="/study-here/student-services/effective-learning-service-els/how-to-avoid-plagiarism/" title="QMU How to Avoid Plagiarism">Plagiarism and Referencing area</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Considerations – Online Communication</strong></p>
<p>We are proud of QMU’s diverse student body and ask you to recognise that the challenges of on-line communication can be magnified in classes of native and non-native speakers. A non- native speaker can easily feel uncomfortable among native speaking online communicators. The University asks you to recognise that different cultures bring different points of reference, different understandings of humour and different expectations of online communication, so:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Avoid using complicated language, terminology, slang, idioms or local acronyms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware of differences in date formats and measurements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful with sarcasm and humour, and avoid ridicule</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow extra time for responses, especially in chats</p>
