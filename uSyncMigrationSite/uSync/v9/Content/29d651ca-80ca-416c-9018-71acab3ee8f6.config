      <Value><![CDATA[<p>9.3       The overall aim of the validation and review process is to secure for the students of Queen Margaret University a high quality educational experience. The most important function is to assess the quality and standard of programmes. As such, it is critical that Panels established for validation and review purposes are composed of individuals with sufficient relevant experience to make such judgements.</p>
<p>9.4       However, to promote the development of staff without experience in validation and review, Panels should normally include one inexperienced internal member. To facilitate this, Deans of School and Heads of Division will be asked to identify suitable staff to the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement at the start of each session.</p>
<p>9.5       To ensure that appropriate members are selected for Panels, consideration will be given to the need for specific skills, for example, experience of clinical placements.</p>
<p>9.6       Panels for postgraduate events should normally include a majority of panellists who have experience of teaching at postgraduate level. Panels for approval of collaborative programmes should normally include at least one member with experience of collaborative arrangements at the University.</p>
<p>9.7       To ensure continuity, it can be helpful for a review Panel to include individuals drawn from the original validation or previous review event. However, it is recognised that this is not always practical or possible.</p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>9.1       The volume of validations and reviews in any one academic session can be very high, and the availability of suggested Panel members is always a complicating factor. Nonetheless every attempt will be made to establish a Panel at least two months prior to the event.</p>
<p>9.2       The Deputy Principal, University Secretary and Head of the host Division must approve all Panel members.</p>]]></Value>
