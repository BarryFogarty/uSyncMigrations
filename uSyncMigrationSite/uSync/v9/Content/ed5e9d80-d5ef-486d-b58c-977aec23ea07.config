    "content": "<p>Diagnostic radiographers provide an imaging service within a hospital setting including accident and emergency, outpatients, operating theatres and wards. X-rays are an imaging technique used by diagnostic radiographers to visualise injuries or disease, or monitor changes inside the body. Diagnostic radiographers also carry out a much wider range of procedures, which may include cross-sectional imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound and radionuclide imaging (RNI).</p>\n<p>As a student on this course, you will complete a number of modules that integrate anatomy, physiology, radio diagnostic imaging, physics and equipment, enabling you to understand the theory of diagnostic imaging. This theory will be put into practice in workshops in a clinical laboratory enabling you to experience the role of a diagnostic radiographer, including communication with teams and with service users, before placement blocks. You will also be required to complete a dissertation.</p>"

Single module study is not available.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Academic study is learner-centered with the analysis and synthesis of knowledge being of paramount importance. You will be expected to take overall responsibility for your learning. Teaching methods include keynote lectures, clinical workshops and tutorials, student-led seminars, group discussions, clinical observation and practice. Directed learning materials will be delivered via a virtual learning environment (the Hub) and comprise reading, self-assessment quizzes, workbooks, tutorial questions with answers and narrated lectures.</p>\n<p>Clinical skills will be developed in work placements in radiology departments in hospitals in central Scotland.</p>\n<p>A variety of assessment methods will be used, including online examinations, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), self-appraisal, course work, ePortfolio, viva voce examinations and clinical assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>In Year One there are 18 weeks of placement and 22 weeks in Year Two, including an elective placement. QMU will allocate students with a placement across central Scotland, for example, the Lothians, Fife, Forth Valley, Ayrshire, Tayside and the Borders. However, for four of these weeks you will be on elective placement, which can be taken anywhere in the world. Students choose, arrange and fund this placement block but QMU can assist with any documentation that may be required.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by both our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2dd20be03fd249188113645703524d02}\" title=\"Master of Radiography: Diagnostic (MDRad)\"><strong>Master of Radiography: Diagnostic (MRad)</strong></a> and <strong>MSc Diagnostic Radiography (Pre-Registration)</strong> courses. We have one dedicated Diagnostic Radiography room to practice technical and professional skills, with fully functioning x-ray equipment. Our diagnostic radiography students also utilise QMU's Clinical Simulation Suite, Physiotherapy and Podiatry skills rooms which are equipped to simulate the real-life placement environment. Students have access to numerous anatomy models which are incorporated into their learning during practical sessions and can be used during self-directed study sessions.   </p>\n<p>Watch the video below to see all the specialist teaching and learning facilities at QMU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"mceNonEditable embeditem\" data-embed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL4abucK0mw\" data-embed-height=\"456\" data-embed-width=\"950\" data-embed-constrain=\"true\"><iframe width=\"811\" height=\"456\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UL4abucK0mw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Explore the Specialist Facilities at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module that you study on will require you to attend classes and carry out independent work. The pattern of attendance at QMU will depend on the modules you are studying.</p>\n<p>Attendance at professional modules is monitored to ensure safety to work in the clinical environment. In clinical placements the normal hours of a radiographer (ie full-time, Monday to Sunday) will be followed.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>The cohort is normally 15-20 students to ensure that the clinical experience can be tailored to individual needs. Some academic modules have larger class sizes as students engage with other allied health professionals.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
