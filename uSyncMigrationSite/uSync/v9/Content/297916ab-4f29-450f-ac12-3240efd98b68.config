<li><strong>Range of employment opportunities:</strong> In offering a broader range of study areas within one degree, students can begin to future-proof themselves by having flexible graduate attributes applicable to a range of employment sectors.</li>

<li><strong>Practical experience:</strong> The 20-week internship will give you the optimum balance of practical and theoretical learning and boosts your employability.</li>
<li>Opportunities, awards and scholarships: Various funds will be available to help individuals take part in extra-curricular activities across the four-years. Funds also enable class trips to a range of visitor attractions and events and perhaps even taste the produce on a brewery and distillery tour as part of your studies at QMU.</li>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> QMU has over 125 years of teaching expertise in hospitality.</li>
<li>Location and employment opportunities: As a capital city and top tourist destination, and one of the most famous events' cities in the world, Edinburgh offers many opportunities for part-time employment as a student and your career beyond graduation.</li>
<li><strong>Industry links:</strong> We have strong links with industry in Edinburgh and further afield. We regularly host guest lectures, either physically on campus or virtually, featuring experts from across the UK and even as far as the Caribbean.

<p>The experiential nature of this course will equip you with excellent management skills and the practical expertise needed to succeed in these vibrant industries, which will put you at the forefront of graduates, and open doors to a wealth of career opportunities.</p>
<p>Our location in Edinburgh is sure to enrich your learning experience: Known as “the festival city” and one of the world’s top tourist destinations, you have an abundance of hospitality and events venues right at your doorstep, which provide numerous opportunities for internships, field trips to distilleries and a wide range of other attractions, as well as part-time work and graduate career opportunities.

<p>The hospitality, tourism and events sector has experienced significant growth in recent decades, emerging as a significant contributor to both the Scottish and global economy, accounting for 1 in 10 jobs worldwide and supporting a substantial number of enterprises. The events sector in particular has undergone remarkable expansion over the last 20 years, encompassing everything from pop-up food fairs to high profile corporate events, trade shows and our own world-famous Edinburgh festivals. While Hospitality, Tourism and Events can be viewed as separate industries in some ways, they are also deeply interlinked in others, and throughout your course you will deepen your understanding of this through experiential learning, enabling you to put theory into practice. This involves the creative planning, delivery, and execution of live events, participating in a group walking tour, leading live business consultancy, and various others. Moreover, your 20-week paid industry internship will equip you with real-life experience that is sure to boost your employability.</p>
