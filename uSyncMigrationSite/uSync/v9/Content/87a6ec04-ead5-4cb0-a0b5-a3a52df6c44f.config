BSc (Hons) students will refine and further develop their practical expertise, while undergraduate master's students also explore advanced clinical practice and research opportunities.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the path you take, you'll graduate with the qualifications needed to register with the HCPC, empowering you to launch a rewarding career as an occupational therapist.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Our course is designed to allow you to get to know your peers and our staff, and build positive academic and professional relationships. Teaching and learning methods include interactive lectures, seminars, practical workshops, group work and self-directed learning. Outside timetabled sessions, you will be expected to continue learning through independent study. For assessment, we focus less on written examinations and more on demonstrations of knowledge and understanding: reports, essays, presentations, oral and practical examinations, and creative assessments.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements provide the opportunity to integrate practice with theory. A practice placement is offered in each year. You will work with individuals, groups and communities in a variety of settings. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of full-time placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or caring responsibilities) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern specialist spaces for use by our Master of Occupational Therapy (MOccTh)/BSc (Hons) Occupational Therapy and MSc Occupational Therapy (Pre-Registration)<strong> </strong>courses. A variety of practice skills are taught both in generic clinical skills rooms and in our own Occupational Performance Room. We also utilise QMU's clinical simulation suite which is equipped to practice both hands-on skills and communication in a simulated real-life (hospital based) environment. In addition to these spaces, our students have access to art/craft based practical rooms as well as kitchens and the outdoor spaces around campus (eg the QMU allotment) when engaging in a variety of occupations.  </p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
