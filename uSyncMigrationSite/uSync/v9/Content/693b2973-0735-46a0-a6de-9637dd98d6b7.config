SCQF levels refer to the academic level of study (for undergraduate programmes this is typically SCQF level 7 to 10 and for postgraduate programmes SCQF level 11). Levels one, two, three and four do <strong>not</strong> map directly onto SCQF levels, but the following will apply to the majority of modules:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">
<li>Level 1 (first year of undergraduate study) - SCQF level 7</li>
<li>Level 2 (second year of undergraduate study) - SCQF level 8</li>
<li>Level 3 (second year of undergraduate study) - SCQF level 9</li>
<li>Level 4 (second year of undergraduate study) - SCQF level 10</li>
<li>Postgraduate -  SCQF level 11</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">For a part-time undergraduate student, a level typically spans more than a single academic year.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">1.4   Each student is enrolled on a programme and is subject to the regulations of that programme, which in its turn is subject to the University’s overall regulations and policy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">1.5   Students are subject to registration periods which stipulate the minimum and maximum periods that they may be registered on a programme. These are detailed in the University’s <a href="/media/3965/registration-regulations.pdf">Registration Regulations</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">1.6   An award will be conferred upon satisfaction of the following conditions:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">
<li>the candidate was a registered student of the University at the time of their assessment and has fulfilled all financial obligations to the University;</li>
<li>the candidate has completed a programme approved by the University as leading to the award being recommended;</li>
<li>the award has been recommended by a Board of Examiners convened, constituted and acting under regulations approved by Senate.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">1.7   Senate is the ultimate authority in the University for the ratification of academic decisions and may, in extreme circumstances, over-rule a Board of Examiners. It will normally refer matters of concern back to the Board of Examiners for reconsideration.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">1.8   Acting within the above principles, a Board of Examiners will exercise its judgement in reaching decisions on individual candidates. It is responsible for interpreting the assessment regulations for the programme, in the light of the University's requirements and good practice in higher education and its academic judgement should not lightly be questioned or overturned.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">1.9   Appeals by students against the decisions of Boards of Examiners shall be subject to University procedures and practices, as set out in section of the Governance and Regulations dealing with Academic Appeals and Student Complaints and published on the University’s <a href="/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/">Regulations, Policies and Procedures</a> web page.</p>]]></Value>

The regulations and policy ensure that academic standards are maintained and that there is a retention schedule for copies of assessments and feedback on assessments.</p>\n<p>4.3   Assessment regulations and policy are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that they remain fit for purpose.</p>\n<p>4.4   As part of the procedures for the validation and review of awards, programme teams are required to develop an assessment strategy which demonstrates a close alignment with the full range of intended learning outcomes (including knowledge and understanding, intellectual skills, practical skills and transferable skills) and mode(s) of study of that programme, including the requirements of Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies.</p>\n<p>4.5   Programme assessment strategies are designed to assess all intended learning outcomes but should reduce the extent of assessment to the minimum required to demonstrate the above and should avoid duplication.</p>\n<p>4.6   QMU is committed to principles of best practice in assessment, as established by the Advice and Guidance within the QAA Quality Code’s Assessment Theme, and any subsequent updates to that publication.</p>\n<p>4.7   QMU is committed to the principles of equality of opportunity. Assessment regulations and procedures are designed to actively promote equality of opportunity, and to be compliant with all relevant equality legislation.</p>\n<p>4.8   QMU subscribes to the principle of anonymous marking. Anonymous marking shall be used in assessments wherever practicable. Proposals for exemption for modules that cannot be anonymously marked will be considered through the University’s validation and review process or committee structure as appropriate.</p>\n<p>4.9   QMU supports the principles of the award of credit and of credit transfer, as specified by the SCQF, in all of its assessment procedures.</p>\n<p>4.10   QMU supports the recognition of, and the award of credit for, prior accredited and experiential learning as set out in the University’s Guidance on Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) found on the University’s <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/\">Regulations, Policies and Procedures</a> web page.</p>\n<p>4.11   QMU recognises the need for transparency in the assessment of students.</p>\n<p>4.12   QMU recognises the need for a detailed student transcript, in accordance with the European Diploma Supplement, as a means of communicating the achievement by a student.</p>\n<p>4.13   All modules which are designed to lead to the award of academic credit are expressed in terms of learning outcomes that are capable of assessment and include details of the assessment and of the assessment criteria to be employed.</p>\n<p>4.14   All modules which lead to the award of academic credit come under the purview of a Board of Examiners. Modules will be assigned to an External Examiner as set out in the External Examiner Regulations, or defined in the Definitive Programme Document.</p>\n<p>4.15   The normal language of assessment is English, but exceptionally other languages may be used where this is described as part of the definitive document for a programme and, in these cases, the language of instruction and assessment will be clearly shown on the student transcript.</p>\n<p>4.16   Module descriptors specify the format of assessment but, as a minimum requirement, QMU requires a student to submit a digital copy of all assessments, wherever this is practicable. This digital copy acts as the archive copy of that assessment.</p>\n<p>4.17   Feedback</p>\n<p>Staff must make every effort to meet the QMU requirement of disseminating assessment marks and feedback to students within the following timeframe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undergraduate level one and two assessment: within a maximum of 20 working days of the assessment submission.</li>\n<li>Undergraduate level three and four assessment (with the exception of Honours projects and dissertations): within a maximum of 15 working days of the assessment submission.</li>\n<li>Undergraduate Honours projects and dissertations: within a maximum of 20 working days of the assessment submission.</li>\n<li>Postgraduate assessment: within a maximum of 20 working days of the assessment submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working days equates to Monday to Friday, excluding University closure days. The maximum of 15/20 working days includes all stages within the marking process and applies to all staff. Only in exceptional circumstances should staff exceed the 15/20 working days requirement. Where this occurs, students must be informed of the extension at least seven calendar days before the original deadline for receipt of feedback.    </p>\n<p>QMU requires staff as a minimum to submit feedback and grading for each assessment component on an appropriate pro forma (except where appropriate alternatives are provided (e.g. audio feedback). This applies to coursework and examinations. Feedback on course work will normally be individual. A digital copy of this pro forma will act as the archive copy of the feedback and grade awarded for that assessment<em>. </em>Pro formae<em> a</em>re usually completed electronically and must be scanned instead, if handwritten. Standard feedback may be provided to the full cohort for an examination. However all students also have the right to request individual feedback from the Module Co-ordinator.  </p>\n<p>4.18  A copy of student assessments and the related feedback pro formae will be kept during the time that a student is matriculated, or as specified by the University’s Records Retention Schedule.  </p>"

    "title": "5   Fairness, reliability and validity of assessment",
    "content": "<p>5.1   Assessment can take many different forms, as dictated by the variety of programmes and learning outcomes but, in all cases it should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fair, in that there should be equality of treatment across all programmes and that there should be a consistent approach to equality and diversity;</li>\n<li>Valid, that is the assessment can be shown to be relevant to the intended learning outcomes;</li>\n<li>Reliable, in that there should be consistency of processes and standards across the institution and that there should be comparability of both the volume and complexity of assessment in relation to credit and SCQF level;</li>\n<li>Useful, in that it contributes to the knowledge and competencies and employability of the learner;</li>\n<li>Transparent, in that the requirements of the assessment in terms of intended learning outcomes and assessment criteria are made clear to the student.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5.2   To maximise accuracy and fairness of assessment, programme teams are expected to follow the procedures for marking, moderation and blind double marking set out below. The terms ‘marking’, ‘moderation’ and ‘blind double marking’ are defined as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Marking</strong></p>\n<p>The process of assessing students’ work, taking into account QMU guidelines for assessment feedback and the relevant criteria/mark schemes as devised by programme and/or module teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderation</strong></p>\n<p>The process of confirming the consistency of the mark and feedback provided by the original marker(s).</p>\n<p><strong>Blind double marking</strong></p>\n<p>Marking conducted without access to marks, annotations or comments from any other marker. Both markers must use the relevant criteria and provide feedback to students in the agreed format.</p>\n<p>5.3   Where there are differences between first and second markers, these should be resolved through a process of discussion and negotiation. On occasions where such differences cannot be resolved through this method, the case will be referred to a third marker. A single agreed mark is provided to the student as an outcome of the above procedures.</p>\n<p>5.4   If appropriate, Examiners may adjust the raw marks attained by students in individual subjects, but the basis of the scaling must be reported to the Board of Examiners who will be asked to endorse the scaling.</p>\n<p>5.5   All assessed work should have associated marking criteria. These guides to marking should be developed simultaneously with assessment instruments and, where practicable, be approved by the External Examiner. Sharing of approved marking criteria with students is a required feature of good practice. All feedback given to students should relate to the agreed marking criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>5.6   Internal moderation</strong></p>\n<p>5.6.1  All elements of assessments for Honours projects and postgraduate dissertations (or equivalent) at SCQF levels 9, 10, 11and 12 must be blind double-marked for the whole cohort.</p>\n<p>5.6.2  All summative assessments for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that are not blind-double marked must be moderated on a sampling basis as a means of verifying the accuracy of marking. The size of the sample to be moderated must be at least the square root of the total number of students (rounded to the nearest whole number) taking the assessment plus all borderline fails (those that are within 2% below the pass mark). The sample should include a range of performance and the minimum size should be six pieces of assessed work.</p>\n<p><strong>5.7     External Examiner moderation</strong></p>\n<p>5.7.1  A sample as outlined above will be reviewed by External Examiners for assessment leading to a named award.</p>\n<p>5.7.2  External Examiners will normally only be required to moderate samples for an individual module once per academic year. They will not normally be required to moderate samples for reassessments or multiple occurrences of the module provided the mode of assessment and marking team remain unchanged from the original assessment. The Board of Examiners will determine whether the External Examiner will be required to moderate additional samples for reassessment or an additional occurrence of the module.</p>\n<p>5.7.3  It is the responsibility of the Module Co-ordinator to select the sample to be reviewed by the External Examiner. This need not be the same sample used for internal moderation.</p>\n<p>5.7.4  Further information on External Examiner arrangements for collaborative programmes can be found in the <a href=\"/about-the-university/partnerships/qmu-collaborations-manual/\">Collaborations Manual.</a></p>\n<p>5.7.5  In circumstances where an External Examiner has concerns about the submitted marks for a sample of assessments, the External Examiner may not modify one or more marks of the sample group of students but must review the marks of the whole cohort. External Examiners may make recommendations only on the adjustment of marks. It is the responsibility of the Programme Team to consider these recommendations and take a final decision on the student mark.</p>\n<p><strong>5.8     Responsibility for assessment</strong></p>\n<p>5.8.1  In all cases Module Co-ordinators have responsibility for the conduct and quality control of assessment in their own module(s). Programme Leaders are deemed responsible for the quality of assessment across programmes and are accountable to the Head of Division through the Programme Committee. Deans of School have responsibility for assessment regulations and policy and staff development (as it affects assessment) within the parameters set by the University and any relevant Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies. It is expected, however, that this responsibility will be delegated to Heads of Division.</p>\n<p>5.8.2    School Offices are responsible for the maintenance and retention of records of all provisional marks. The Student Records Office and the School Office under the direction of the Assistant Secretary, Registry and Academic Administration, will maintain a central archive of approved final marks.  </p>"
