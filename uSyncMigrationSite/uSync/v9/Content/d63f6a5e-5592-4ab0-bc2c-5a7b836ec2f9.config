The University will use all reasonable endeavours to provide programmes of study listed in the prospectus and to deliver them in accordance with the descriptions of programmes set out. However, as the University is committed to ensuring that programmes remain up to date and relevant, it reserves the right to discontinue, merge or combine programmes and to make variations to the content or method of delivery of programmes, if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. This, combined with the need to publish the prospectus well in advance, means that changes to the information presented in the prospectus may have occurred. Intending applicants are advised to visit the University website <a href=\"/study-here\" title=\"QMU Study Here\">Study Here</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Admissions Email Address\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> before applying. The content curriculum of a programme may change for a number of reasons, including that:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>The change is required to ensure that the programme continues to deliver its key learning outcomes and the content of the programme is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the programme;</li>\n<li>For programmes leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration;</li>\n<li>The change is not a material change to the content or curriculum;</li>\n<li>The change operates for the benefit of the students on the programme;</li>\n<li>The change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University;</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">It is necessary to ensure that the programme continues to align with the University’s </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">aims, strategy and mission.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative modules or programmes or the option to transfer to another programme at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain programmes from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change. The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change in order to assess any impact on students and mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the academic interests of existing students impacted by any programme withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University shall not be liable for failure to perform any its obligations if such failure is caused by any act or event beyond the University's reasonable control including acts of God, war, terrorism, industrial disputes (including disputes involving the University's employees), fire, flood, storm and national emergencies (\"Force Majeure Event\"). If the University is the subject of a Force Majeure Event, it will take all reasonable steps to minimise the disruption to students.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>An offer of a place at the University is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to the procedures of, the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full within the University’s website under <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/\" title=\"QMU Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct\">Regulations, Policies and Procedures</a>. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that theUniversity’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University and across the higher education sector. Where the University’s Regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis, depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The University is currently reviewing its Smoking Policy with a view to achieving this aspiration. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to challenge their Fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to Fee status be considered after the 14 day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face to face contact) have a legal right to cancel the contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the contract within 14 days of acceptance, they must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14 day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14 day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may lose all or part of the tuition fees paid by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University Procedures. The University may cancel the contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Tuition fees are payable for all programmes and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Retail Prices Index and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">increases in the costs of delivering and administering the programme. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year. Details on tuition fees and other charges can be found on our website under <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges/\" title=\"QMU Tuition Fees and Charges\">Tuition Fees and Charges</a>. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until his or her tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony, or to proceed to the next year of their programme until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred whilst on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>For some programmes, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made in respect of graduation and, where applicable, reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out under <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges/\" title=\"QMU Tuition Fees and Charges\">Tuition Fees and Charges</a> on our website and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Tuition Fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students a new Direct Debit form is required for each year of study. If students experience payment difficulties resulting in tuition fees remaining unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21 day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any programme which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University, if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Admission to some degree programmes offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a programme when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the programme Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular programme will necessarily be allowed to complete the programme if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. All applicants are asked to disclose criminal convictions to help safeguard the welfare of our students. Applicants for certain programmes of study must declare all criminal convictions, and in these cases the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these programmes will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland, or an appropriate equivalent. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on their application, they must contact the programme Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within particular programmes may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified their self-declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Whilst programmes are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any programme.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the General Data Protection Regulations and the Data Protection Act (2018). This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the contract between it and the student. As part of the contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies. Full details of the way in which the University uses students’ information are provided in the Student Privacy Statement which is issued as part of the matriculation process.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Every matriculated student is automatically a member of the Students’ Union.

Appeals on the grounds of extenuating circumstances will not be accepted where there is evidence that the circumstances that form the basis of the submission could have been submitted to the EC Panel by the published deadline, and the student has no grounds for not submitting by that deadline.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>4.4 </strong>A student’s disagreement with the academic judgement of a Board of Examiners does not provide a valid ground for appeal.</p>\n<p><strong>4.5</strong> Any student considering an appeal is encouraged to contact the Students’ Union for advice and assistance.</p>\n<p>5 Stage 1 - Academic Appeal </p>\n<p><strong>5.1</strong> A student wishing to appeal against a decision of the Board of Examiners should submit the appeal in writing to the University Secretary within the time limit stated in paragraph 3 of these procedures.

The Dean of School will normally respond to the student by first class post within 21 days of receipt of the appeal, either giving a decision or specifying a date for the decision. This timescale may be extended where the Dean of School is absent from the University through leave or illness.</p>\n<p><strong>5.4</strong> The Dean will produce a report that documents fully the issues raised by the appellant, the facts established by the investigation, and the manner in which the facts were used to inform the judgement. The Dean of School will provide a copy of the response to the University Secretary. In coming to a judgment, the Dean may:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>confirm the decision of the Board of Examiners, on the grounds that the evidence presented did not support the case;</li>\n<li>provide the appellant with an additional first or second diet of examination, as the case may be, provided that, in upholding the appeal and granting an additional diet, the terms of the University’s Assessment Regulations are taking into consideration; or</li>\n<li>should it not be possible to provide an additional diet for the appealed result, to provide a suitable alternative as the Dean thinks fit and is reasonable in all the circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.5</strong> If a reconsideration of the student’s case gives rise to a change in the student’s progression this must be ratified, depending on how material the changes are, by:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li> the Convener of the Board of Examiners;</li>\n<li>the Convener of the Board of Examiners and the External Examiner/s</li>\n<li>all the members of the Board of Examiners by correspondence</li>\n<li>a meeting of a subset of the Board</li>\n<li>a meeting of the full Board of Examiners.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> <strong>5.6</strong> The University Secretary, in consultation with the Dean of School, will determine the most suitable of those identified above to deal with the matter, and the procedure to be followed thereafter.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>6 Stage 2 - Academic Appeals Committee</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6.1</strong>  If the appellant is dissatisfied with the decision at Stage 1, they may resubmit the appeal in the original or in a revised form to the University Secretary within 21 days of receipt of the response from the Dean of School.</p>\n<p><strong>6.2</strong>  The University Secretary will pass the appeal to the Deputy Principal, who, having considered the substance of the appeal and the previous attempts at resolution, will decide whether or not a prima facie case is established.

Representation external to the University will not be permitted in the context of this procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>7.5</strong>  The Academic Appeals Panel may interview staff and/or students relevant to the appeal. If the appeal is on the ground of the actions of an individual, that individual has the right to be informed of the substance of the appeal, and to attend the appeal hearing and be accompanied by a friend or supporter.</p>\n<p><strong>7.6</strong>  Any person called to give evidence to the Appeal hearing will be given at least 72 hours’ notice of the time and place of the hearing.

It is also occasionally necessary to intercept network traffic. In such circumstances, appropriately privileged staff will take all reasonable steps to ensure the privacy of service users.

In such circumstances the Head of Subject or Division, or more senior line manager, will be informed and will normally be consulted prior to action being taken.

When leaving the University, staff should make arrangements to transfer to colleagues any e-mail or other computer- based information held under their account, as this will be closed on their departure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7.

It is important, therefore, when you go out on a placement that you make it a priority to familiarise yourself with the local regulations. Before you go out on your placement, your academic supervisor will try to ensure that you get a copy of the organisation’s specific ICT usage regulations. When you get onsite, it is worthwhile going over these regulations with your placement supervisor. This will help you get a better understanding of what is permitted and what is not. You may also find it helpful to make contact with the local ICT support department or helpdesk. The staff there will be able to give you more help and advice.</p>\n<p>Remember – all organisations have different regulations about what you can and cannot do with their ICT facilities. You must respect these when you are out on placement. It is your individual responsibility to familiarise yourself with the local regulations and to ensure that you do not abuse the ICT facilities offered to you when you are on placement. Any computer facilities offered to you whilst on placement will be provided for University work only, i.e. for use in learning, teaching and pursuit of studies. You must not abuse these facilities for any other purpose, e.g. to play computer games, for excessive social use of email, or for recreational internet use.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">15.2  Keeping safe</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>If you are a health sciences student, your research will require internet searches based on anatomical words and phrases.

We seek to promote diversity amongst our students, staff and applicants. We recognise the particular contributions that are made by individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, to the achievement of our vision and strategic objectives. We aim to promote entry to, and provide education at, undergraduate and postgraduate level to a diverse range of students, whatever their background. Our equal opportunities policy is available on our website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>2.4</strong> </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Each application received by the University is considered carefully on its own merits, taking into account educational, professional and personal experience.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In assessing candidates for admittance to the University, we are committed to the following principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fairness – the University strives to use admissions assessment methods that are reliable and valid.</li>\n<li>Transparency – details of our entry requirements are published in our prospectus and on our website, and are clear and transparent to applicants and their advisers.</li>\n<li>Reflecting our community – we are committed to admitting as wide a range of applicants as possible to reflect our community.</li>\n<li>Encouraging participation – we aim to minimise barriers to applicants and encourage progression and retention through our targeted pre-entry, transition and post-entry support services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3. Service delivery </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>3.1</strong>  The University is committed to continuous improvement in all it does. We take a professional approach to admissions.</p>\n<p><strong>3.2</strong>  The University ensures a wide range of pre-entry and outreach activities are available to applicants and stakeholders, along with individual advice and guidance.</p>\n<p><strong>3.3</strong>  Admissions, student recruitment and outreach &amp; community engagement staff receive regular training, support and guidance to ensure that they provide accurate, timely and consistent advice and guidance to applicants and other stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>3.4</strong>  A range of staff, including the Transition and Pre-entry Adviser, College Articulation Officer, Student Funding Adviser and the Disability Team are available to ensure that potential students obtain all the relevant information required, so they are appropriately informed during their decision making process to come to the University.</p>\n<p><strong>3.5</strong>  Academic admissions tutors work closely with recruitment and admissions staff to ensure that entry requirements are fair and transparent.</p>\n<p><strong>3.6</strong>  Staff in admissions are trained and supported to ensure that they are able to make fair and equitable admissions decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>3.7</strong>  We aim to process applications as quickly as possible. However, where there is an application deadline, applications may not be processed until after the deadline in order to ensure equal consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>3.8</strong>  Offers of admission are communicated to applicants in clear and easy to understand language</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>3.9</strong>  We recognise the importance of providing feedback to unsuccessful applicants. Where an applicant is unsuccessful, we give a reason for this via UCAS for undergraduate applicants or by email for postgraduate applicants. While the University aims to provide informative feedback that is helpful to applicants, it may not always be possible to provide highly specific or tailored advice.</p>\n<p><strong>3.10</strong>  If the University makes a change to a course, which is deemed to impact significantly on the student, or withdraws a course after an application has been received, we will email applicants to explain the reason for the change or withdrawal and offer advice and guidance about alternative courses, either at QMU or elsewhere.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">4.Terms and conditions</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University’s published terms and conditions apply to all applicants for undergraduate and postgraduate study.

A full review of the policy in its entirety is undertaken every 5 years. The Head of Admissions and Recruitment is responsible for the operation of the policy and for its regular monitoring and review. The policy will be checked annually to ensure accuracy and to reflect any changes.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>5.2</strong>  This policy is underpinned by several other University policies which are available on our Regulations, Policies and Procedures web page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contextual Admissions Policy</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Fitness to Practice Policy</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Code of Practice on Criminal convictions and disclosure</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Data protection policy</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Undergraduate and postgraduate regulations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.3</strong>  The University has a centralised admissions service. All applications are dealt with by a team of professionally trained officers and administrators. Decisions on applications may be made by Admissions Officers or by Academic Admissions Tutors.</p>\n<p><strong>5.4</strong>  Admissions Tutors are responsible for setting entry criteria, subject to advice from programme teams, validation and review panels, School Academic Boards and the Head of Admissions &amp; Recruitment.</p>\n<p><strong>5.5</strong>  Entry requirements are set when a new course is approved, or validated, and are reviewed on a regular basis. Any changes to entry requirements will be agreed by the School Academic Board.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">6. Admissions process</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6.1</strong> All full time applications for undergraduate courses must be made through UCAS. All part time applications and applications for postgraduate courses should be made directly to the University using our on-line application form, accessible through each course page.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6.2</strong>  All UCAS applications received by the published UCAS deadline are given equal consideration. Postgraduate applicants are encouraged to submit applications as early as possible. Where a programme has a specific deadline, this will be clearly published in the prospectus and on the course pages of our website. Postgraduate programmes which have limited numbers of places may become full before a published deadline has been reached. In such cases, the programme will be closed and any applicants waiting for a decision will be informed as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>6.3</strong>  A number of courses require interviews or auditions as part of the application procedure. Where an interview or audition forms part of the selection criteria, we stipulate this in our prospectus and on our website. Arrangements are made to interview applicants by telephone or Skype where travel to the UK is not possible.</p>\n<p>We explain to applicants the nature and purpose of the interview and ensure that interviews are conducted fairly by appropriately qualified staff.</p>\n<p><strong>6.4</strong>  A number of courses require the inspection of a portfolio of work. Full details of these requirements are published in our prospectus and on our website.</p>\n<p><strong>6.5</strong>  Where applicants have made more than one application to study, decisions will be made separately.</p>\n<p><strong>6.6</strong>  Applicants may be offered an alternative programme of study if they do not meet the minimum entry requirements for their chosen programme.</p>\n<p><strong>6.7</strong>  Where applicants are required to provide photocopies of their qualifications with their application, we may require sight of the original documentation at matriculation. Applicants will be notified in advance of matriculation if this is required.</p>\n<p><strong>6.8</strong>  We allow applicants to defer entry to most of our programmes for one year. UCAS applicants wishing to defer are required to meet all the conditions for entry in the year that they apply. Postgraduate applicants can defer a conditional offer. An applicant can only defer the offer of a place once, and after that they will be asked to reapply unless in exceptional circumstances. Where it is not possible to defer an offer of study, an applicant can reapply the following academic year.</p>\n<p><strong>6.9</strong>  Where an applicant has extenuating circumstances, we take this into consideration. However, where these circumstances have affected the grade achieved in a qualification required for entry, we would expect that this is dealt with by the examining body.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7.

The minimum entry requirements for each course are published each year in our prospectus and on our website.</p>\n<p><strong>7.1.2</strong>  Achieving the minimum entry standards does not guarantee an offer of a place on a course as there can be considerable competition for places.</p>\n<p><strong>7.1.3</strong>  For all courses we look for evidence of motivation, suitability, skills and attitudes. For programmes which lead to eligibility for professional registration we also expect <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">applicants to demonstrate an exploration of the profession within their personal statement.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>7.1.4</strong> If an applicant does not have the normal entry requirements, but has relevant experience and can demonstrate that there is a reasonable expectation that they will complete the course, then it may still be possible to consider them.</p>\n<p>We recommend that applicants who have no formal qualifications, or have been out of formal education for some time, contact admissions to discuss appropriate pathways to study.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7.2 Undergraduate entry requirements</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>7.2.1</strong>  The University accepts a wide range of qualifications for entry. We set our entry standards for Scottish Highers, A Levels and Irish Leaving Certificate using the UCAS Tariff as a metric to ensure equity. We also consider a range of other equivalent qualifications using established bodies such as UCAS and UKNARIC to compare qualifications</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.2</strong>  Our entry criteria and offers are usually expressed in grades. When making a grade based offer, we will make it clear when we expect those grades to be achieved by. Applicants are expected to achieve the required number of qualifications at specific grades, dependent on the degree programme applied for. We may use the UCAS Tariff to calculate equivalencies for non-standard entry qualifications.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.3</strong>  Where an applicant has attempted a qualification more then once, we normally count the highest grade achieved, but we do not double count the qualification.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.4</strong>  The general minimum entrance requirement for an Undergraduate Degree is usually one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least three SQA Highers at grade C or above. Most degrees also require passes in Maths and English at Standard Grade/Int2/ National 5 at grade C or above;</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">At least two full A Levels at grade D or above. Most degrees also require passes in Maths and English at CGSE at grade C/ 4, or above;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Irish Leaving Certificate with at least three passes in the Higher Level subjects at grade H3 or above;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Pass in the International Baccalaureate Diploma</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Pass in the European Baccalaureate;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">A BTEC national Diploma at level 3;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">A relevant Access or Foundation course.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7.2.5</strong>  Where we have requested Higher English as an entry requirement, we will also accept Higher ESOL as meeting that requirement for all programmes except BA (Hons) Education Studies (Primary).</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.6</strong>  Where National 5 Mathematics is required for entry to a course, National 5 Lifeskills Mathematics and National 5 Applications of Mathematics will be considered to meet this criteria, at the required grade.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>7.2.7</strong>  The University welcomes the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence. Our entry criteria are largely based on qualifications achieved ‘on entry’ rather than over a particular number of sittings. Published entry requirements for Scottish Highers may be achieved over two or more sittings.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.8</strong>  The University acknowledges that the Curriculum for Excellence gives students the opportunity to take a broader range of qualifications, undertaken at different stages of learning. Some students may progress from general education to Highers, without achieving a National 5 qualification. If you do not hold a subject that is required at National 5, you must have achieved or be predicted to achieve that subject at SQA Higher.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.9</strong>  QMU values the Advanced Higher qualification as an excellent preparation for University study, but will only count the highest level of qualification in any subject. This means that we wouldn’t count AS levels or SQA Highers if you have the full A Level, or an Advanced Higher in the same or similar subject.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.10</strong>  We will accept AS level qualifications in addition to the two A Levels. We do not accept A Level General Studies for entry to any of our courses.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.11</strong>  We welcome applications from those studying the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), however we recognize that not all students have access to the qualification, so we do not include them within entry requirements, and they do not carry additional credit in the selection process.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.12</strong>  The University welcomes applications from those studying Foundation Apprenticeships. The Foundation Apprenticeship will count as one subject within an applicant’s overall presentation of qualifications. Where specific subjects are required for entry to one of our degree programmes, a Foundation Apprenticeship will not replace that requirement, but will be counted as one of an applicant’s additional subjects.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.13</strong>  The University welcomes and supports students seeking to apply for advanced or direct entry to our undergraduate programmes of study. Applicants must apply through UCAS, by the UCAS deadline in order to be considered for a place.</p>\n<p>Advanced entry may be offered to applicants with evidence of accredited prior learning, such as HNC, HND, Advanced Higher or A Level qualifications. Applicants who wish to be considered for Advanced Entry should state this clearly on their UCAS application, using the Point of Entry box.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.14</strong>  We have established articulation agreements with local colleges. Applicants must apply through UCAS by the UCAS deadline in order to be considered for a place. We aim to place applicants with a relevant HNC into the second year of our courses and those with an HND into the third year of our courses.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Generally applicants applying for second year entry with an HNC will be required to get a B in their graded unit, while applicants applying for third year entry with an HND will be required to get C/B in their graded units.</p>\n<p>Where advanced entry is not possible, then a relevant HN qualification may be considered for entry into the first year of a programme.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>7.2.15</strong>  We also accept a wide range of other qualifications, including diplomas and certificates that equate to SCQF level 7 or 8 for advanced entry. However, the content and level must match that of our courses sufficiently for us to be satisfied that the learning outcomes have been achieved.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.16</strong>  We are able to consider accreditation of non-certified learning (APL) and we have a rigorous process in place for assessing APL. We are also able to identify, explore and claim academic credit for previous certificated and/or experiential learning through the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) process. For learning to be awarded as credit towards your programme of study, it needs to match learning outcomes and to be evidenced.</p>\n<p>You may be able to gain RPL credit for previous certificated study, undertaken elsewhere. You also may be able to gain academic credit for experience; for example experience gained through volunteering, or in your workplace. Please see the Recognition of Prior Learning Guidance on our <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures\" title=\"QMU Regulations, Policies and Procedures\">Regulations, Policies and Procedures</a> website for further details.</p>\n<p><strong>7.2.17</strong> Students presenting with Advanced Highers or strong A Level grades in relevant subjects may be eligible for entry to the second year of some of our courses.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7.3 Postgraduate Taught entry requirements</span></p>\n<p><strong>7.3.1</strong>  All postgraduate applicants should have already achieved a first degree, normally at Honours level or equivalent, or a professional diploma which is recognised by the relevant professional body as the equivalent of an Honours degree.

Harassment Defined</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The definition of harassment in the Equality Act 2010 is wide. It is ‘where a person (A) engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic and the conduct has the purpose or effect of:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(a)  violating another person's (B's) dignity, or</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(b)  creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for B’</p>\n<p>It should be noted that 'unwanted' does not mean that express objection has to be made, and a serious one-off incident can amount to harassment.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that differences of personality traits or culture and the misinterpretation of social signals can mean that what is perceived as harassment by one person may not seem so to another. The defining feature, however, is that the behaviour is offensive or intimidating to the recipient, and as such would be regarded as harassment by any reasonable person. It would need to be considered that, if the purpose of the conduct was to violate the individual’s dignity or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment, then this is sufficient to establish harassment. However if harassment was not the purpose, but an individual argues that this was the effect of the conduct, the Equality Act says that in deciding whether conduct has that effect, consideration must be given to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the perception of the claimant;</li>\n<li>the other circumstances of the case; and</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have had that effect.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forms of harassment involve offensive conduct or behaviour directed at a person’s racial origin, religion and beliefs (including non-belief), gender, disabilities, sexual orientation, age, family status (including their role as a carer or as a part-time worker, fixed term worker), marital status, political opinion, socio-economic status, or because they are a member of a trade union or similar associations or some other personal characteristic. It can also include the inappropriate use, or threat of use, of physical and mental power, authority or through social media.</p>\n<p>With regard to religion and belief, it should be noted that there may be cultural differences which make some forms of behaviour generally regarded as acceptable by one group and unacceptable to another because such behaviour does not form part of the normal social interaction of that particular group.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Examples of potential harassment could be:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Unwanted physical contact or physical attack.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Offensive, suggestive or derogatory remarks, gestures, mockery, taunts, pranks, jokes,</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">insults or ridicule; in person, on the telephone, by emails or social networking sites.</span></li>\n<li>Verbal abuse, threats or intrusive questioning.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Insulting remarks based on the grounds of personal appearance or personal </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">circumstances.</span></li>\n<li>Using an individual’s known disability to demoralise them.</li>\n<li>Leering at another individual’s body.</li>\n<li>Compromising invitations or gifts.</li>\n<li>Requests or demands for sexual favours.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Circulation or displays of offensive, suggestive or degrading materials (such as pictures, </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">graffiti or objects) in the teaching, learning, living or working environment.</span></li>\n<li>Sending of unwanted messages via e-mail and social networking sites.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Ridicule for cultural differences such as appearance, dress, diet, religion or ethnic </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">background.</span></li>\n<li>Subjecting an individual to group pressure.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Derogatory or belittling remarks in front of others regarding appearance, work or personal </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">attributes.</span></li>\n<li>Deliberately or repeatedly ignoring someone.</li>\n<li>Unwarranted exclusions.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Any comments which imply that gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, race or ethnic </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">or national origins, religious or other belief impairs the individual’s ability to perform </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">satisfactorily.</span></li>\n<li>Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct.</li>\n<li>Incitement to commit any such act.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7.

It may be by an individual against an individual or involve groups of people. It may be obvious or it may be insidious (such as ignoring a person).</p>\n<p>Bullying can result from a misuse of individual power derived from perceived superior status/position, physical strength or force of personality. It can also arise from the collective power that arises out of strength of numbers.</p>\n<p>Bullying is normally characterised by the emergence of a pattern of behaviour however if one act is deemed serious enough, this could amount to bullying.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Examples of potential bullying could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Threats;</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Abuse;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Public humiliation</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Ridicule </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">repeated shouting or swearing at an individual </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Undermining an individual; and </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">intimidating behaviour </span></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">9.Victimisation Defined</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Victimisation is when an individual is treated less favourably than they would otherwise have been because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have made a claim or complaint;</li>\n<li>They have helped someone else to make a claim by giving evidence or information; or</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">It is known or suspected that they are contemplating bringing a complaint.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under the Equality Act 2010, these are known as ‘protected acts’.

The University will, therefore, put into place policies and procedures to protect staff from such unacceptable behaviour. These policies and procedures will include the requirement to inform the complainant of any decision to restrict their access, their right of appeal, and any procedures for reviewing such a decision to restrict contact.</p>\n<p>The University conforms to the principle that complainants have the right to be heard, understood and respected and the University strives to respond to all complaints in a fair, transparent and proportionate manner. However, occasionally the behaviour or actions of individuals prevents the University from dealing with the complaint under the Complaints Handling Procedure. The University is committed to equality of opportunity of all and expects all members of its community to be treated courteously and with respect. This Policy details the procedure to be followed in the event of unacceptable behaviour being determined, and procedures for reviewing that decision.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>1 DEFINING UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR</strong></p>\n<p>It is recognised that people may act out of character at times of trouble, distress or as a symptom of illness. Behaviour that is forceful or determined is not, of itself, considered unacceptable. However, the actions of a person that result in unreasonable behaviour or demands on University staff or services or aggressive behaviour will be considered unacceptable. Examples of this are as follows:-</p>\n<p><strong>1. Unreasonable demands:</strong> a demand becomes unreasonable when it starts to (or complying with that demand would) impact substantially on the work of the staff or on University services. This could relate to the amount of information sought or the nature and scale of the service expected. All circumstances should be taken into account. Examples could be repeatedly changing the substance of a request or raising unrelated concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>2.Unreasonable levels of contact:</strong> if the level of contact from an individual exceeds what would be considered normal or reasonable, for example, numerous phone calls over a short space of time or being inundated with further information, then the contact may be considered unacceptable, particularly when this contact impacts on the complaint handler’s ability to undertake other work tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Unreasonable use of the complaints process:</strong> when an individual submits multiple complaints which have the objective of preventing the University pursuing a legitimate aim or implementing a legitimate decision.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Aggressive or abusive behaviour:</strong> behaviour or language, whether spoken or written, that may cause staff or students to feel afraid, threatened or abused will not be accepted. This can include threats, physical violence, inappropriate gestures, indecent comments, personal <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">verbal abuse, discriminatory or derogatory remarks, rudeness, inflammatory statement or unsubstantiated allegations.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2. MANAGING UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR</strong></p>\n<p>If an individual’s behaviour adversely affects the ability of a member of staff to do their work or provide a service to others, that member of staff will be entitled to restrict the contact that individual has with the University. If that individual is a member of staff or a student then the relevant discipline procedures may need to be considered. In serious cases, there may be a termination of all direct (face-to-face, voice or email) contact with the individual and incidents may be reported to the police.</p>\n<p>The following actions may be used in situations where an individual shows unreasonable persistence:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit contact to telephone calls from the complainant at set times on set days;</li>\n<li>Restrict contact to a nominated member of staff;</li>\n<li>See the complainant by appointment only;</li>\n<li>Restrict contact to written correspondence only, this may be through a third party;<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Return all correspondence and documents and in extreme cases, advise that further </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">correspondence will be destroyed; or</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Take other actions as appropriate, for example, restricting the complainant’s Univers</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">ity </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">email address or blocking emails from a specific address.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The threat or use of physical violence, verbal abuse or harassment towards staff will not be tolerated and is likely to result in the termination of all contact with the complainant. If the complainant is a member of staff or student, the relevant discipline procedures will be considered.</p>\n<p>Staff have the right to politely end telephone calls or meetings if an individual is considered aggressive, abusive or offensive.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>3.  PROCEDURE FOR MANAGING UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR</strong></p>\n<p>Before determining whether to use one of the actions listed above, the member of staff should consider whether:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The relevant complaints/appeals/freedom of information or subject access request procedure has been correctly and fully implemented in relation to that individual’s request;</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Due warning has been given to the complainant that continued contact may be deemed unacceptable;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Any reasonable adjustments have been made for that individual; and</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">There has been due regard to any of the protected characteristics in relation to the </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">individual.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staff should, where possible, try to diffuse the situation by calmly informing the individual that their behaviour is unacceptable and must stop. Staff can ask their line manager to assist with this <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">as appropriate. Should this approach not work, the member of staff should approach their line manager who will determine whether the actions of that person affects one member of staff or the whole team and then take the appropriate action to limit contact. When staff across the University are affected, the University Secretary should be consulted.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Decisions to restrict contact can only be made after the individual has been given an opportunity to modify their behaviour. The decision should be communicated in writing, with clear contact arrangements specified and the length of time the restriction will be in place.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>4 APPEAL, RECORD AND REVIEW</strong></p>\n<p>The individual concerned should be given the opportunity to appeal the decision to restrict contact. The appeal should be referred to the University Secretary who may nominate another senior member of staff to determine on whether the restriction was made appropriately. The procedure undertaken, the proportionality of the decision and the reasoning for the decision to restrict contact may all be reviewed. The appeal will be considered on the balance of probabilities. The decision of the University Secretary, or of their properly appointed delegate, is final.</p>\n<p>Any decision to restrict contact with an individual should be thoroughly recorded, with clear and transparent reasons, and an appropriate entry should be made in the individual’s file.</p>\n<p>The decision to restrict contact may be reconsidered should the individual display reasonable behaviour. A review procedure, at set intervals, should be included in the correspondence which communicates the decision to restrict contact.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

If the offence is reported to the police, the Principal may decide to defer action until the police and/or courts have dealt with the matter.</p>\n<p><strong>3.4</strong>  If the Principal regards the alleged offence as serious, no internal disciplinary action, other than suspension or exclusion from the University, will normally be taken until the matter has been reported to the police, and either a prosecution has been completed or a decision not to prosecute has been taken.</p>\n<p><strong>3.5</strong>  The University has the right to report any alleged criminal offence to the police. However, if a person claims to be the victim of a serious offence committed by a student, but does not wish the police to be involved, the Principal may agree not to report the matter to the police. In such circumstances the University will not normally proceed with internal disciplinary measures for the serious offence, although it may take disciplinary action over other related offences.</p>\n<p><strong>3.6</strong>  Where a finding of misconduct has been made under these regulations, and a student has also been sentenced by a criminal court on the same facts, the penalty imposed by the criminal court will be taken into account in deciding the penalty under these regulations.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>4 Suspension or exclusion</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>4.1</strong>  A student who is the subject of a complaint of misconduct or against whom a criminal charge is pending or who is the subject of police investigation, may be suspended or excluded from the University by the Principal, pending disciplinary hearing or trial.</p>\n<p><strong>4.2</strong>  A student who is suspended is prohibited from entering University premises and from participating in University activities. Suspension may be subject to qualification, such as permission to take an examination. The terms of the suspension will be notified in writing to the student. An order of suspension may include a requirement that the student shall have no contact with a named person or persons.</p>\n<p><strong>4.3</strong>  A student who is excluded from the University has restricted rights to enter University premises and to take part in University activities. The terms of the exclusion will be notified in writing to the student. An order of exclusion may include a requirement that the student shall have no contact with a named person or persons.</p>\n<p><strong>4.4</strong>  Orders of suspension and exclusion pending a disciplinary hearing or trial are normally to be used where necessary to protect a member or members of the University, or the property of the University or the property of a member or members of the University community. Written reasons for the decision will be recorded and made available to the student.</p>\n<p><strong>4.5</strong>  Unless the matter is deemed to be urgent by the Principal, no student shall be suspended or excluded unless they have been given an opportunity to make representation to the Principal. The representation may be made in person or in writing, as the student chooses, and may be put forward by the student or by the student's adviser, friend or representative. In cases deemed to be urgent by the Principal, a student may be suspended or excluded with immediate effect. An opportunity will be given to the student to make representation as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>\n<p><strong>4.6</strong>  A decision to suspend a student, or to exclude a student from academic activities associated with the student's programme of study, shall be subject to review at the request of the student after four weeks. Such a review will not involve a hearing, but the student, either personally or through their adviser, friend or representative, will be entitled to make written representation. The Principal will conduct the review.</p>\n<p><strong>4.7</strong>  In addition to the initial review, the Principal shall review the suspension or exclusion on receipt of evidence of altered circumstances that might affect the order.</p>\n<p><strong>4.8</strong>  A student may appeal against an order of suspension or exclusion using the process set out under section 9 of these Regulations.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>5.

The Principal may dismiss the allegation immediately if they believe that there is no case for the student to answer, or that it is for some other reason appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>5.2</strong>  If the allegation is not so dismissed, and the offence does not lead the Principal to suspend or exclude the student under the provisions outlined in section 4 above, the matter will be referred to the relevant Dean of School. The Dean of School will consult with the University Secretary to determine whether or not the matter should be dealt with summarily or referred to a Disciplinary Panel, subject to paragraph 5.6 below.</p>\n<p><strong>5.3</strong>  If the matter is dealt with summarily, the Dean will consider written or oral evidence as they think fit. The Dean will find the student guilty of misconduct only if, on the available evidence, they are satisfied of the student's guilt. If a finding of guilt is made, they may impose any of the penalties set out in these regulations, other than expulsion from the University.</p>\n<p><strong>5.4</strong>  At the termination of the proceedings, the Dean will write a short report. In the event of a finding of guilt, the report will set out the misconduct alleged, a brief summary of evidence received, the grounds for the finding of guilt, the penalty imposed, and the factors taken into account in deciding the penalty. A copy of the report will be sent to the student. Where the misconduct relates to examinations or other assessed work, the report may contain recommendations concerning examination marks, and a copy of the report will also be sent to the appropriate Board of Examiners.</p>\n<p><strong>5.5</strong>  There is a right of appeal against a finding of guilt as set out in section 9 below.</p>\n<p><strong>5.6  </strong>If the University Secretary does not consider it appropriate to deal with the matter summarily, or if the student does not agree to its being dealt with in that way, then it shall be referred to a Disciplinary Committee under the procedure set out in section 6 below.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6 Disciplinary committee</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6.1</strong>  The University Secretary will appoint the members of the Disciplinary Committee, and invite one of them, other than a student, to act as Convener.

It is essential for researchers to gain an understanding of ethical principles, because in practice ethical issues are often complex, relative to the particular research project, relative to the competence of the research team and require the reasonable anticipation of likely future risks and problems. The core of ethical research is the ethical sensitivity of the research team, which is an art based on principles rather than a rule-governed process, or a set of tick box barriers to be overcome before the real work can begin.</p>\n<p>Ethical research requires a balance to be struck between minimising probable harm and advancing academic knowledge, being appropriate in terms of human dignity, and in social and cultural impact. Researchers should use the basic ethical principles outlined here to guide their decisions about how to conduct research, how to treat their research participants and how to handle the data that they gather about them. For much research the relevant decisions are straightforward or have sound precedents.</p>\n<p>Issues such as protection of identity, privacy, obtaining informed consent, communicating appropriately with participants, ensuring participant autonomy and freedom of choice, and ensuring that no harm comes to participants or researchers are among the many ethical issues that people planning research must have in their minds. Additionally, researchers have a moral responsibility to tell the truth and to preserve participant confidentiality.</p>\n<p>However, in some cases deciding on an acceptable ethical approach within a study may be more difficult. Top quality research is by definition innovative and may pose new ethical challenges. For these reasons, although the competence of the research team is critical (imagine surgery by the untrained), neither the track record of the team, nor the prestige of the institution waives the need for an adequate ethical review process.</p>\n<p>The ethics review process at QMU aims to be collaborative and constructive. In considering ethical issues from the conceptual stage of a proposal it is intended to enhance the quality of research and increases the chances of productive funding and publication outcomes. In cases where ethical approval is not granted at the first stage, the aim is that discussion with members of the School or University Ethics Panel is used to achieve an acceptable approach that should also facilitate positive research outcomes for students and staff.</p>\n<p>2. The Main Ethical Principles</p>\n<p>There are four ‘clusters’ of moral principles which provide a framework for making decisions about the ethical aspects of a study (Beauchamp and Childress, 2001).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respect for people’s autonomy</strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Non-maleficence; do no harm</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Beneficence; do good</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Justice</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>It is hard at the ethical approval stage for research to guarantee doing good and being just, but it is critical for it to avoid disrespecting people’s autonomy or harming them.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.1 Respect for Autonomy</strong></p>\n<p><strong> 2.1.1 Dignity</strong></p>\n<p>Participants in research should be treated with appropriate dignity. A rule of thumb test is for researchers to ask whether they would consider it appropriate for a beloved family member to participate in the research. Historical cases abound of research participants being treated in undignified, even brutal, ways that are clearly unethical. Nonetheless, sometimes research requires intrusive, invasive, tedious or unpleasant treatment of participants. Participating can be boring, stressful, challenging, upsetting or even painful. Such ‘invasive’ research protocols need to be justified by the potential benefits of the research. It is essential to consider also the social impact of the research results, independently of the scientific impact. Cases have occurred where because of the rarity or uniqueness of participants, their anonymity has easily been violated and social stigma and other harm has resulted.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.1.2 Informed Consent</strong></p>\n<p>Respect for autonomy also requires ensuring that research participants have truly consented to participate in the research, of their own free will, without coercion or manipulation of any kind and fully informed of the risks, benefits and consequences of their participation. This is not simply about getting the required signature on the consent form.</p>\n<p>All research involving human beings requires informed consent. This applies even to tissue samples or data acquired about those people for other purposes.</p>\n<p>To ensure genuine informed consent, it is essential that researchers consider the extent to which the people being recruited are capable of fully and freely giving their informed consent. There are two common restrictions on this, which often need to be dealt with. First, when the people to be recruited are, in some sense, vulnerable or limited in their capacity to consent in an autonomous fashion. Researchers who are working with vulnerable people such as children, prisoners, those with some form of mental illness or incapacity or the very sick or old will need to pay particular attention to the way in which they gain informed consent. The process of gaining informed consent from young people and children is complex and must be informed by current legislation (BMA, 2000).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Second, when the demand characteristics of the social situation where the research occurs implicitly or explicitly coerces people into participating in the research. Examples include potential participants believing that the research will benefit them, believing that their therapy or treatment will suffer if they do not participate, believing that significant others, whether friends, family or professionals, will think badly of them, and believing that they will, <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">in some sense, ‘stand out’ or be incriminated by refusal. For example, does refusal imply that they have something to hide?</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A third, rarer, limitation is when research offers money or other benefits that are so large as to easily persuade people to participate for the benefits alone. This is generally considered to exclude modest payments to cover the costs of travel and inconvenience. Pay and other benefits offered should be modest in proportion to the effort required to participate.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.1.3 Who Should Consent?</strong></p>\n<p>Only persons able to freely understand, question and refuse without fear of sanction or reprisal can give informed consent. For research involving participants who may lack the capacity for understanding and questioning, such as children, people with mental or intellectual difficulties, or people severely ill or heavily medicated, consent should be obtained from a parent, carer or other person serving in a responsible capacity AND from the participant themselves, to the extent that they are capable of understanding and offering consent. Ingenuity needs to be exercised in providing satisfactory consent procedures in such cases. Consent from the parent or carer alone is rarely adequate.</p>\n<p>The freedom to refuse to participate in research is potentially threatened where there is a power imbalance between the prospective participant and the researcher, along with their perceived allies. For example, students may believe that refusing to participate in staff research will not count well for them when they are being educationally assessed. This can occur even if the researcher is not directly one of the student’s teachers. The two key methods of ensuring true refusal are:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>to ensure whenever possible that the research team is completely independent of anybody in a position of power over the potential participants, and</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">that the procedures to ensure independence are explicit during the informed consent process. For example, should the medical consultant be one of the research team (as is often the case), it should be clear that they will have no knowledge of whether an individual patient has participated or not. Where this is impossible, other means of enabling true refusal should be actively written into the research protocol.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also important to remember that research on groups, societies, organisations, institutions and their members also ‘involves human beings’ who ought to consent to it occurring. This does not necessarily mean obtaining consent from everybody, but appropriate procedures should be in place for collective consent, treating the organisation as the ‘participant’.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.1.4</strong> The Process of Informed Consent</p>\n<p>All international declarations stipulate that, prior to consent, each participant in a research project should be clearly informed of its goals, its possible adverse events, and the possibility to refuse to enter or to retract at any time with no consequences. How to inform is a critical part of the process. Participants are rarely able to recall what they have agreed upon when signing an informed consent form. An example Information Sheet and Consent Form can be found in Appendix 2.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The following strategies may help to safeguard informed consent:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Close attention to the language and readability of written material, which includes translation procedures for non-native language speakers.</span></li>\n<li>Honest explanation of the possible risks and benefits of participation. Particular caution should be exercised to avoid ‘lies of omission’; if the research procedure is boring, unpleasant or simply lengthy, it is best to make this clear.</li>\n<li>The opportunity for potential participants to discuss the project and ask questions with somebody sympathetic who understands the research: Ideally one of the research team.</li>\n<li>Use of alternative media, such as visual information.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In complex or hazardous cases, the informed consent procedure should involve a detailed </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">interview and discussion, rather than the mere signing of paperwork.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.1.5 The Informed Consent Form</strong></p>\n<p>This usually includes an actual form to be signed, along with an information sheet and as much additional material as is appropriate. This entire pack constitutes ‘the consent form’.</p>\n<p>Two general questions should be answered on the information sheet:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>What are the likely benefits of the research for science, for society and for the research participants? This should enable potential participants to make an informed choice to participate, even if there are risks.

But, even simple time-wasting can be harmful, so it is the research team’s duty to weigh up the potential for harm against the benefits of the study and to come to a justifiable conclusion. It is also the team’s duty to ensure that research which carries a risk of harm should only be conducted by competent research teams. Many potential ethical issues can be resolved by ensuring that the research team has sufficient competence to manage problems appropriately. For example, a badly designed survey by an undergraduate may waste participants’ time, where a well-designed one would not.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.2.1 Competence</strong></p>\n<p>The normal model for a research team is that there are one or more researchers who directly interact with participants and one or more supervisors who oversee. Part of the ethics review process is to establish that the research team is competent to (a) minimise harm, (b) conduct research that is like to be of sufficient quality to be worth any risks of harm, which at the mildest level includes wasting participants’ time and effort, and (c) manage serious harm should it arise, even if it is very unlikely. Competence is a function of relevant skills, experience, training to be achieved during the research process and the devotion of appropriate time and effort to the research project. A good research team has an appropriate mix of competencies. When researchers are less competent, then supervisors need to be more competent and supervise more closely. Therefore, particular care should be exercised in decisions about what types of research can be conducted by undergraduates. Staff teaching loads can sometimes make close supervision difficult, so unless a student has special demonstrable competencies caution should be exercised in developing undergraduate research that raises major ethical issues. Conversely, a team with specialist expertise can conduct research that might be unethical conducted by a team without such competencies. Where appropriate, it is important to report on the team’s competence in the ethics application. A track record of publications in the area is not always sufficient. There are also <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">specialised competencies that need to be considered. For instance, researchers working with young people or other vulnerable groups will need to be police checked according to current Disclosure Scotland guidelines (www.disclosurescotland.co.uk) Researchers who intend to work with children should consider this when planning the timescale of their research.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.2.2 Risk Assessment and Risk Management</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In order to address the issue of ‘risk of harm’, researchers must demonstrate that they have exercised a standard of due care. As well as being competent, this involves identifying the likely risks, assessing the probability that they will occur, evaluating the risk to determine its acceptability in relation to the objectives of the research and finally managing the risks which involves the steps that can be taken to minimise them (Beauchamp and Childress, 2001:199).</p>\n<p>Common examples of managing risk include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Screening procedures that identify participants more likely to come to harm through the research.</li>\n<li>Competence to work with participants who become distressed, including being able to listen and communicate appropriately about the distress and being able to refer to further counselling should this be required</li>\n<li>Sufficient knowledge to provide advice about services or help as a result of discussing needs which are not being met</li>\n<li>Sufficient knowledge to discuss the benefits of appropriate interventions</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Adequate post-research debriefing, including offering explanations of any necessary </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">deception or withholding of information.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Appropriate research training on the proposed research techniques: For example, </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">appropriate specialist interview skills; specific experimental methods; specialist biological </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">sampling.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Appropriate risk assessment for the conduct of the research, including any physical or </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">biological risks faced by researchers and participants.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Adequate supervisory procedures to address researchers’ difficult thoughts and feelings </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">about the research and the participants, to reduce harm to researchers.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.3 Beneficence: Do good</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Will the research truly benefit the individual participants, or those like them? Will the research truly benefit some wider or more abstract entity such as science, knowledge, or society? Naturally, researchers generally hope the answer to at least some of these questions is ‘yes’. However, in justifying research it is important to reflect upon and respect conflicting notions of benefit. It is unethical to assume that benefit to participants, to science, or to society are an absolute good. Contemporary disagreements abound: For example, over animal rights, over the age at which the foetus becomes a person, or the appropriate balance between eroding individual liberties and promoting safety.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>When research can genuinely indicate likely beneficence, then this is important ethically and may justify research that would otherwise seem excessively hazardous to participants.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>However, this situation is relatively rare. Usually, ethical research involving human participants is about minimising harm, rather than increasing likely benefits.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.4 Justice</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to treat people equally and fairly and ensure that they are accorded their full rights. In research practice, much of this occurs under issues of truly informed consent (see 2.4.2). It is also worth mentioning the need to consider issues of participant selection criteria. There are often legitimate reasons for restricting a study to a specific gender, or age group, or excluding non-native speakers of the predominant language, or excluding specific ethnicities. However, sometimes these choices are made mainly for convenience, which may be ethically debatable and can require justification. There are many instances where convenient sampling criteria have resulted in a consequent lack of knowledge of whether findings apply to excluded groups. Any inclusion or exclusion criteria to be employed in the research should be clearly outlined and justified in the ethical approval application. There are also issues, now widely recognised by research councils and the NHS, of the extent to which research participants are entitled to help form the research agenda. Participant involvement in research design is good practice.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.4.1 Confidentiality</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>As well as being a basic rule of research ethics, confidentiality is also the subject of considerable literature and legislation including the Data Protection Act 2018. It is important to keep confidentiality distinct from anonymity.</p>\n<p>Anonymity involves the protection of the participant so that even the research team cannot link them to the information provided. Nowadays, this not only requires the avoidance of names, but also other identifier information such as postcodes, or NHS CHI numbers. Moreover, particularly in small-scale more qualitative studies, some participants may be identifiable solely by the data they provide. Consequently, true anonymity from start to finish is relatively rare in research and should not be offered unless it is really provided.</p>\n<p>Confidentiality in contrast involves the prevention of disclosure of identity other than to authorised people, for authorised purposes. For example in the NHS, patient records are confidential, but may be accessed by any NHS staff for appropriate purposes; but not for inappropriate ones. Using records for malicious gossip would be a serious breach of confidentiality.</p>\n<p>In most research projects confidentiality is a process, rather than a condition. It is important to make clear to participants what confidentiality involves and what measures will be in place to protect participants from unwanted violations of confidentiality.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>If the data are retained for further research researchers need to ensure that the informed consent form explains and justifies this. Applicants should describe the measures taken to encode or anonymise stored data. Generally, data sets should be anonymised as soon as it is reasonable to do so, even if this requires the loss of potentially useful information. Even where only anonymised data are used, adequate security for storage and handling of such <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">data must be demonstrated. This includes avoiding the unnecessary duplication of electronic data sets, which increases the chances of their being misused.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.4.2. Data Storage</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The data protection act and confidentiality requirements (see above) pose a dilemma for data storage, which is another ethical requirement of research. If research is not going to be published in the public domain, but was conducted primarily for educational purposes, then raw data should be destroyed once the research work has been educationally assessed. Any data retained electronically should have all personal identifying information removed. QMU has electronic (<a href=\"https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Repositories page\">eResearch</a>, QMU Research Repository) and physical data repositories and has developed a <a href=\"https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/handle/20.500.12289/7180\" title=\"QMU eTheses\">thesis repository</a>. Please contact Information Services for further details. For research that may be published in the public domain whether this is student or staff work, raw research data needs to be stored for a reasonable period of time so that it can be re-accessed and checked should issues or queries arise (for example from conflicting findings by other research teams). The QMU Retention Policy is that raw data, including interview tapes, completed questionnaires, and other material, generally should be retained for five years after the research programme is completed, although this can vary depending on funder and other requirements. Additionally, signed consent forms should be kept separately from the data for 12 months on campus and thereafter in remote secure storage for the duration of the retention of the physical data. It is the responsibility of the principal researcher/supervisor to comply with current data protection legislation and store data securely for the appropriate length of time and destroy the data at the end of this period. Storage will normally be in the Subject Area (locked secure storage for physical data) or in your QMU password protected cloud/online drives for electronic data).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>2.5. Academic freedom and restrictions on publication</strong></p>\n<p>QMU policy is opposed to research that has restrictions placed on the publication of findings (see Appendix 4). These restrictions are usually placed by some funders, including some NHS, government and industry sources. Sometimes there are legitimate ethical reasons for restricting publication, for example to protect commercial interests. However, is becoming more common for funders to stipulate that they own the intellectual rights to research they have funded, simply to control the information and, potentially prevent or manage its release into the public domain. This is contrary to the spirit of academic inquiry and such research is arguably unethical because it colludes in the suppression of information. Research at QMU should not be contracted with strong clauses restricting publication. This should have been negotiated during the funding application process, but the Ethics Panel reserves the right to challenge the ethical probity of research where publication of findings has been restricted by the funding contract.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Section 2 - <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Procedures for Ethical Approval</span></span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>1.

The process of applying for ethical approval at QMU is described in this section, and is outlined in the flowchart in Appendix 1. The research team are responsible for applying for approval in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Research should not collect any data from participants, or use other data that is not in the public domain until Ethical Approval has been granted. So doing potentially constitutes serious research misconduct. In some circumstances, the data collected may be inadmissible. In serious cases students or staff involved may be subject to disciplinary procedures. If anyone becomes aware that research data is being collected or used without Ethical Approval, then they should immediately notify their Head of Division/Research Centre and the Research Ethics Panel. At minimum, staff and students will be required to suspend data collection/use immediately until Ethical Approval is obtained. The Research Ethics Panel cannot guarantee that approval will be granted retrospectively for data already collected.</p>\n<p>The first step in gaining ethical approval is to complete an ‘Application for Ethical Approval for a Research Project’. This form is available on <a title=\"QMU Website\">QMU’s website</a>.</p>\n<p>Most questions on the form are self-explanatory. Section 1 of this document – Ethical Principles to guide research – should be read before the Application for Ethical Approval is completed.</p>\n<p>It is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure that the Application for Ethical Approval form is fully completed, legible and literate, and has any supplementary material such as consent forms or information sheets attached as appropriate. Any form that deviates markedly from this standard will be returned to the applicant by the Divisional Ethics Committee, without review.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.THE ROLE OF THE DIVISIONAL RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The completed application with information sheet and consent form included as appropriate, should be submitted to the relevant Divisional Research Ethics Committee (DivREC) for consideration.

DEFINING DIFFERENT RESEARCH PROCEDURES – NON-INVASIVE, MINOR INVASIVE AND MAJOR INVASIVE RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>These distinctions originated in medical research, where the distinctions are relatively obvious in terms of physical harm or disturbance. Invasive procedures involve the possibility of major harm, even if there may also be major benefits. Minor invasive procedures pose a risk of some harm and non-invasive procedures are unlikely to be harmful at all. These distinctions can also be applied to research with human participants that is not physically invasive.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6.1</strong>  <strong>A non-invasive procedure</strong> in humans would be one where it was unlikely that anybody would find participating at all stressful, upsetting, disturbing or psychologically or socially harmful. Usually, this requires a short procedure, a topic not controversial, stigmatising or distressing, no deception or discomfort during the procedure and highly confidential data handling procedures. Truly non-invasive procedures require only the addressing of standard ethical issues, clear demonstration that they are non-invasive, and should generally be approved by the relevant DivREC.</p>\n<p><strong>6.2</strong>  <strong>A minor invasive procedure</strong>, in contrast, might be stressful, upsetting, disturbing, or psychologically or socially harmful, but probable harm would be brief and limited in nature relative to the participants’ lives. For example, some participants will find somewhat invasive any procedure that involves any overt or implied element of personal appraisal, because they have concerns about doing things properly or appropriately. On the other hand, someone suffering from a serious illness might find an interview about it only mildly invasive, compared to the invasion and upset already associated with their clinical care. To judge research non- invasive it is important to make a positive case that upset is highly unlikely and/or worth the benefits to participants and research. Minor invasive procedures additionally require the addressing of procedures to recognise and minimise upset should it occur and clear demonstration that the procedure is not major invasive. When the same or similar procedures have been used before at QMU, then these may be approved by the relevant DivREC. <strong>Minor invasive procedures commonly used in the subject area should be referred to the University Ethics Panel on first use at QMU and part of the application should document their common use in the subject beyond QMU.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6.3</strong>  Major invasive procedures are those where some participants are likely to find participation stressful, disturbing, or psychologically or socially harmful, and probable harm could be protracted or severe. That only a small minority of participants may respond in this manner does not render the procedure minor invasive. In addition to requirements for minor and non- invasive procedures, applications for ethical approval for major invasive techniques should explain how risks are to be minimised and how the research team is collectively competent to minimise and manage harm, should it occur. <strong>Major invasive procedures should be referred to the University Ethics Panel by the relevant DivREC.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A research procedure being major invasive is a function of the nature of the participants, the research topic, the research procedures themselves and the competence of the research team. Vulnerable participants, intimate, illegal, stigmatised or controversial research topics, protracted, demanding, physically stressful or tedious research procedures and a less competent team make it more likely that the procedure will be major invasive.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>6.4</strong> The Panel delegates responsibility for approving non-invasive and established minor invasive research procedures to the Schools. As discussed above, these criteria are relative to (a) the participants, (b) the researchers and (c) the research topic. Significant changes in any of these should be referred to the Research Ethics Panel in the first instance. For example, that some staff commonly use a technique does not justify its use by a student not supervised by any staff member experienced in the technique. Another example is that the invasiveness of questionnaires or interviews is heavily topic-dependent.</p>\n<p>A reasonable principle is often that research procedures approved for vulnerable participants, less experienced researchers and more sensitive topics can often be conducted unproblematically with less vulnerable participants, more experienced researchers and less sensitive topics.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of the relevant DivREC if applicable to keep an updated list of approved methods in that school or subject area and to provide the University Ethics Panel with this list at least once a year. This list will include relevant information about any restrictions on this approval in terms of researchers, participants or topics.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Appendix 1</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">[flow chart ]</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Appendix 2</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Research Ethics Panel Remit and Membership</p>\n<p>Remit</p>\n<p>To ensure that the research conducted in the University complies with appropriate ethical standards and to make recommendations to the Research Strategy as set out below.</p>\n<p>The Panel will have delegated authority to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>a)  determine the ethical propriety of such research projects as are referred to it;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>b)  provide advice to researchers and supervisors on the ethical propriety of their research;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>c)  review on a regular basis the University’s Guidelines on Ethics related to research;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Membership</p>\n<p><strong>Convener</strong> - Nominee of the Research Strategy Committee</p>\n<p><strong>Nominated</strong> - <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Three academic representatives nominated from the academic staff of each School, who are actively involved in research</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Secretary - </strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To be appointed by the University Secretary</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Frequency - <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Business is conducted virtually.

The following procedure is applicable to all students and all diets of examination. Requests for special arrangement of examinations outwith the University should be considered only if exceptional circumstances apply. Senate has agreed that being an international student (broadly defined to include an EU citizen domiciled at distance from the UK) may be considered as an exceptional circumstance.</p>\n<p>4.2  The procedure for special arrangement of examinations to be held outwith the University is as follows:</p>\n<p>4.2.1 Any request for an examination outwith the University requires to have the written approval of both the Programme Leader and the Head of Division/Dean of School:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approved requests for examinations outwith the University should be forwarded in writing to the Registry Examinations Officer, who shall make all subsequent arrangements. The Registry Examinations Officer should normally be informed of any approved requests for special arrangements at the earliest opportunity and no less than six weeks before the relevant diet of examinations is due to take place.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Students are asked to nominate a local centre willing to undertake the examination and to conform to the University’s examination procedures and regulations, but this has to be confirmed as suitable by the Registry Examinations Officer. In addition, the Registry Examinations Officer will act as the official contact point for arrangements with the local centre and with the student.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Any examinations organised at a designated local centre should normally take place at the same date and time (GMT) as the same examination at the University. Where this is not possible, and there is a possibility of contact between students, Registry may require the relevant paper setter to set an alternative examination paper.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Registry Examinations Officer will notify the student of all finalised arrangements in writing at least ten days before the scheduled date of the examination(s) in question.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">There will be an administration charge made by the University (currently set at £75) which will normally be payable by the student. This is intended to cover the costs of the arrangements. Where Programme requirements (such as placements) necessitate such arrangements, this charge will be waived. In addition, the local centre may make a further charge to cover any incurred costs, for which the student may be liable.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.3</strong> Further advice regarding the arrangement of examinations outwith the University is available from the Registry Examinations Officer.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>5.0  INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATES FOR EXAMINATIONS</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>5.1  GENERAL</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5.1.1</strong>  Candidates must ensure that they are aware of the published examinations timetable for both first and second diet examinations and their requirement to attend.</p>\n<p><strong>5.1.2</strong>  Candidates must notify any change of permanent address through the Student Portal.

Copies of both are available at the University’s <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/\" title=\"Regulations, Policies and Procedures Website\">Regulations, Policies and Procedures</a> web page.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">1 INTRODUCTION – SOME IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University’s procedures for the consideration of extenuating circumstances seek to ensure that all students are treated fairly, are not disadvantaged by circumstances <strong>beyond their control</strong>, and that the standards of the University’s awards are maintained.</p>\n<p>It is accepted that, from time to time, circumstances <strong>beyond a student’s control</strong> may affect their ability to undertake assessment on time, or may affect her/his performance in assessment. It is also recognised that assessment periods can be stressful. However, students need to be able to plan and manage their time and their workload, to meet deadlines, to cope with a certain level of stress, and to manage their University studies alongside other responsibilities in life.</p>\n<p>All students have a responsibility to manage their learning, revision and assessment activities throughout each semester or assessment period. It is essential that students plan carefully and manage workloads throughout this time, and do not leave too much coursework, learning, revision or similar activities to be undertaken late in the semester or assessment period. Similarly, when examinations are to be taken at the end of a semester or assessment period, students should conduct revision throughout the semester, and not limit it to the period shortly before sitting examinations.</p>\n<p>It is also essential to recognise that illnesses and difficult life events do occur, and that it is a normal part of life to have to manage these and continue with work or study.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2 WHAT WOULD BE ACCEPTED AS ‘EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES’?</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Extenuating circumstances are defined as:</p>\n<p>“circumstances beyond the student’s control which either prevent the student from submitting a piece of coursework or sitting an examination, or cause the student to perform less well in their coursework or examinations than they might otherwise have been expected to do (on the basis of other work).’</p>\n<p>The term is used to describe those circumstances that cause exceptional interference with academic performance, and which are over and above the normal difficulties experienced in life.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In general, though not exclusively, extenuating circumstances will be of a medical or personal nature affecting the student for a period of time and/or during the assessment period. These are normally circumstances that have prevented the student from demonstrating, or acquiring, the skills, knowledge or competencies associated with a particular module(s). This would include circumstances preventing attendance at an examination, or adversely affecting performance at an examination, or preventing work from being submitted by the deadline set. Examples would include, but would not be limited to, illness, accident, or bereavement.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University does not normally consider medical certificates for long-standing controlled conditions, or self-limiting illness, as evidence in support of extenuating circumstances affecting performance. Students in this category would normally have had the benefit of experience, medical knowledge or help to control the condition or illness, and would normally have registered with the Disabled Student Coordinator, the Disability Adviser, and be working to an agreed Learning Plan. It follows that such students should contact the Disability Adviser at an early point so that these circumstances can be recorded and appropriate arrangements put in place, in line with QMU’s disability policy statement. Further information may be found in the Student Handbook and on the <a href=\"/study-here/student-services/disability-service/\" title=\"QMU Disability Service website\">Disability Service website.</a></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University normally disregards circumstances which students are expected to cope with as part of a properly managed workload, or as part of the normal issues and difficulties that arise as part of life. Circumstances which would not be acceptable are those where a student could reasonably have avoided the situation, or acted to limit the impact of the circumstances.</p>\n<p>The following are examples of circumstances which would NOT fall within the University’s definition of \"extenuating circumstances\":</p>\n<ul>\n<li>completing coursework too late and missing deadlines because of computer; difficulties, or transport difficulties;</li>\n<li>general pressure of work;</li>\n<li>normal work commitments on behalf of an employer;</li>\n<li>having more than one examination on the same day or on consecutive days (unless the student was already suffering from illness or injury)</li>\n<li>missing an examination due to misreading the timetable or oversleeping;</li>\n<li>losing work not backed up on computer disk, or failure of a floppy disk/CD Rom;</li>\n<li>theft of home computer – students are expected to make a back up copy of all work on, which should be stored separately from the computer.</li>\n<li>failure to make alternative travel plans when disruptions were advised in advance;</li>\n<li>a short-term problem or illness which has occurred during the year and which is deemed not to have had an overall effect on the student’s performance; e.g common colds</li>\n<li>where extenuating circumstances have affected the student throughout their time at QMU [on the basis that it would be difficult to determine what her/his marks might have been like otherwise];</li>\n<li>Insufficient computers/printers to do the work [a claim submitted upon this basis would not be supported on the grounds that it indicated lack of advance planning].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Failure of IT would be accepted only in limited circumstances. There may be occasions when, due to unforeseen circumstances, the University’s own computer/IT equipment is unavailable for use. If this happens students may request confirmation from Information Services of this, including the time period and the date(s) of its unavailability. However, it would be reasonable to expect a student to submit the latest draft of their work from a few days prior to the deadline to support their claim.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3 WHEN SHOULD A CLAIM FOR EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES BE SUBMITTED?</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>It is important that students report in advance any circumstances that they anticipate will affect their performance in assessment.</p>\n<p>Students who know that they will be unable to meet the deadline for coursework, or attend an examination – due to circumstances beyond their control – should submit a completed Extenuating Circumstances Claim, with supporting evidence, via the QMU Portal in good time, so that the potential implications can be considered.</p>\n<p>The claim for extenuating circumstances will be considered at this stage by the Programme Leader. If the circumstances are deemed valid and there is time to redeem the situation (e.g. through an extension to deadline for submission of coursework), the authority to agree this rests with the Programme Leader.</p>\n<p>It follows therefore, that the only claims for extenuating circumstances which can normally be considered after the assessment date – either the date of the examination or the deadline date for submission of coursework – are those where it can be demonstrated that the student was affected by an accident or sudden illness, or other circumstances which occurred on or immediately before the day in question and which were entirely beyond the student’s control.</p>\n<p>If it is not possible to redeem the situation [e.g. where the examination was part of a time-table diet of examinations], then the Programme Leader will advise the student concerned, and the claim for extenuating circumstances will be put forward to the relevant Extenuating Circumstances Panel [see section below].</p>\n<p>It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that their claim is submitted to the Programme leader in sufficient time for the appropriate Extenuating Circumstances Panel, normally no later than one week before the meeting. The dates of the Extenuating Circumstances Panel together with details on how to submit a claim/evidence will be notified to students each semester via the Moderator email message system.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Failure to submit a form in advance of the Extenuating Circumstances Panel, without valid cause, will mean that the student may not subsequently appeal against their results on the grounds of extenuating circumstances. It is the student’s responsibility to explain fully the impact of extenuating circumstances on their work/performance. If this is not explained sufficiently, then the student may not subsequently appeal and ask the Board to consider additional information.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">4.

Acceptable supporting evidence would normally be an original (not photocopy) document written and signed by an appropriate third party, giving details of the circumstance, its duration, and, where possible, its impact. An appropriate third party would be one who knows the student in a professional capacity or one who can verify the circumstance from a position of authority (e.g. police officer, solicitor, GP, University Counsellor) and who is in a position to provide objective and impartial evidence. Letters from family members and fellow students are not normally accepted. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for a member of the academic staff to provide a supporting statement.</p>\n<p>Dates of evidence must correspond with the extenuating circumstances detailed.</p>\n<p>If a student has missed an assignment through ill health, then the illness must coincide with the preparation, writing or deadline of that assessment.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Students, who miss an examination or an invigilated test due to illness or are claiming to have been affected by medical problems during examination, should seek medical attention at the time of their illness where possible.

It is not normally accepted in respect of failure to complete coursework by its due date, as coursework schedules normally allow more than five days - often a period of weeks - for the coursework to be completed.</p>\n<p>In periods of illness lasting more than 5 days, a medical certificate must be provided. The certificate must relate specifically to the dates and duration of the illness, contain a clear medical diagnosis or opinion and not merely report a student’s claim that they were unwell.</p>\n<p>Doctors are entitled to charge for any medical certificates or notes they provide, and may not always provide certificates for short periods of illness. A doctor’s note must be on headed paper and/or stamped by the surgery.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Medical certification must normally be submitted within 7 days of the assessment due date.</p>\n<p>If a student has an extenuating circumstance of an unusually delicate or personal nature that they do not wish to document in detail, then the student may elect to discuss with their Personal Academic Tutor or Student Counsellor who will confirm to the Programme Leader that the student has submitted a valid claim. This will ensure that the Programme Leader can consider the claim without knowing all the details.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">5. WHAT MIGHT THE OUTCOME BE?</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A claim for extenuating circumstances submitted in advance of an assessment is not an alternative to undertaking the necessary assessment, but, if successful, will normally result in the student being provided with an opportunity to undertake the assessment at a future date. The option remains for students to submit coursework up to one week after the published deadline date, without a claim for extenuating circumstances, on the basis that the maximum mark which can then be awarded is 40% for undergraduate or 50% for postgraduate modules.</p>\n<p>Where a claim has been submitted after an assessment deadline, or where an examination has been missed, and there is no opportunity to redeem the situation [e.g. by an extension to a deadline] or where a claim is submitted on the basis of diminished performance in an exam or assessment, the Extenuating Circumstances Panel will come to a judgement.</p>\n<p>The Extenuating Circumstances Panel will try to ensure a fair result based on overall performance. It may take a number of actions.</p>\n<p>For example, if a student has missed an examination, and the Extenuating Circumstances Panel considers the reasons to be valid, it can treat the absence in a number of ways.</p>\n<p>Where the claim is in respect of diminished performance as a direct result of the extenuating circumstance, the Extenuating Circumstances Panel will try to determine whether, and to what extent, extenuating circumstances have affected a student’s academic performance, and determine what action, if any, can be taken. In assessing the significance of extenuating circumstances the Extenuating Circumstances Panel will normally take into account:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>the severity of the problem and the length of time involved;</li>\n<li>any supporting documentary evidence;</li>\n<li>whether all work in the same period appears to have been equally affected;</li>\n<li>whether it is possible to gauge the effect of the extenuating circumstances upon academic performance;</li>\n<li>whether achievement is consistent with past performance;</li>\n<li>the type of assessment affected, and how the student had to complete the work (i.e date when work set and deadline for submission).</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Extenuating Circumstances Panel will not give extra marks because a student’s work has been affected by extenuating circumstances, nor will they amend marks from previous years of study, or annotate the statement of results/transcripts with comments about the existence of extenuating circumstances.</p>\n<p>The Extenuating Circumstances Panel may decide that the student is given the opportunity to submit for further assessment in the module (or component of module) against which they have claimed extenuating circumstances. The Extenuating Circumstances Panel may also decide not to uphold the claim on the basis that the student has not made a case, that the supporting evidence does not support the claim, or that the student had no good reason for not advising of the circumstances prior to the assessment or examination for which extenuating circumstances are sought.</p>\n<p>A claim for extenuating circumstances, which has been considered by the Extenuating Circumstances Panel, may not be submitted again under the academic appeals procedures. If a claim for extenuating circumstances forms the basis of an academic appeal, the student will need to demonstrate why they did not follow the procedures for submitting a claim for extenuating circumstances in advance of the Board of Examiners.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">6.

Fitness to Practise procedures should provide for support to students to enable them to learn from mistakes, but must also identify those who give cause for concern.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1.6 Cases will be treated on an individual basis, and with due consideration for fairness and equity.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1.7 The University will comply with its statutory duties in relation to Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults, Rehabilitation of Offenders and Single Equality Legislation.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1.8 References within these regulations to any University officer shall include their properly appointed nominee.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2 Procedures for considering Fitness to Practise</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2.1 The University will seek information about character, health and disability prior to admitting students. Clear information about this will be published in the prospectus.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2.2 In seeking information on character, the University will consider information provided in the character reference and will also seek information about criminal conviction or caution at the point of application.</p>\n<p>2.3 All students of the University are required to declare whether or not they have a conviction or caution as part of the annual student matriculation process. Additionally, healthcare programmes may require students to self-certify annually their continuing fitness to practise.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2.4 Wherever possible, issues relating to fitness to practise will be dealt with as part of the University’s standard procedures, or at the programme level. However, where a judgement is made that such consideration is not appropriate, there is provision for referral to the Fitness to Practise Panel.

In the majority of cases, it is expected that dialogue with the student will establish what adjustments can or cannot be made.</p>\n<p>3.5 More difficult cases will be referred to the Dean of School who should consult the University Secretary.

If the conviction is judged to have the potential to affect the applicant’s suitability for registration as set out in the professional body’s Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics, the University Secretary and Head of Admissions and Recruitment will discuss the matter with the Head of Division and Dean of School. Following the outcome of that discussion the University Secretary will decide whether to convene a Fitness to Practise Panel. Written records of the reasons for decisions will be retained.</p>\n<p>3.8 Where a caution or conviction is revealed through the Disclosure Scotland process or the PVG Scheme, the counter-signatory will consult the Head of Admissions and Recruitment, who will consult in line with provisions of paragraph 3.7 above.

It is a condition of entry to the University that each student shall conform to the published rules and regulations.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4.2 Students on healthcare programmes should be aware that their conduct outside the clinical environment, including their private lives, may have an impact on their fitness to practise, as set out in the requirements of the professional body governing their programme of study. Such requirements are designed to ensure that their behaviour justifies the trust that patients and the public place in their profession.</p>\n<p>4.3 A student may be referred to the University's Fitness to Practise procedure through a number of routes which include by a Programme Committee, by a Disciplinary Committee or directly following a complaint to the University Secretary. Should a student be on placement or just about to go on placement when a matter is raised under this Section of the Fitness to Practise proceedings, the Head of Division may prevent or remove the student from placement with immediate effect if deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p>4.4 Where it is judged that the matter does not fall under the terms of the Regulations governing Discipline, but nevertheless constitutes a concern in terms of professional practice, the Programme Leader will be informed. Where possible allegations in this category will be dealt with by the Programme Leader.</p>\n<p>4.5 Where a Programme Committee has persistent concerns about a student’s conduct which have not been satisfactorily resolved at local level by the Programme Leader, the Programme Leader may ask the University Secretary to convene a Fitness to Practise Panel.</p>\n<p>4.6 A referral or an allegation of concern about conduct must be made in writing, signed by the complainant and submitted to the University Secretary.</p>\n<p>4.7 Anonymous allegations will not normally be considered. In considering the allegation, the University Secretary may withhold the identity of the individual making the allegation if maintenance of confidentiality is considered appropriate.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4.8 Where the conduct that is the subject of the complaint would constitute a breach of the disciplinary code, the University Secretary will refer the allegation to the Principal. The Principal may dismiss the allegation immediately if they believe that there is no case for the student to answer, or that it is for some other reason appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p>4.9 If the allegation is not dismissed, and the offence does not lead the Principal to suspend or exclude the student under the provisions outlined in section 4 of the University’s Regulations governing Discipline, the matter will be referred to the Dean of School. The Dean of School will consult with the University Secretary on whether or not the matter should be dealt with summarily or referred to a Disciplinary Committee or referred directly to a Fitness to Practise Panel.</p>\n<p>4.10 If the finding of the disciplinary procedure, either summary or Panel, is that the student has breached expected standards of conduct, including professional conduct, then the matter will be referred to a Fitness to Practise Panel. That will include those cases where it has been judged that there are mitigating factors, such as a diagnosed health condition.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4.11 In those cases where the conduct reported as giving rise to concern is linked to a mental health condition, the case will normally be referred to the Fitness to Practise Panel as a health matter.</p>\n<p>4.12 Where a matter has been referred to a Fitness to Practise Panel, the Panel will be constituted as set out in Section 2 above. The proceedings of the Panel will be governed by the procedures set out in Section 6 of this procedure.</p>\n<p>4.13 Legal representation will not be permitted at the Panel hearing.</p>\n<p>4.14 The standard of proof applied in considering the case will be the civil standard of proof, ie the balance of probabilities.</p>\n<p>4.15 A Fitness to Practise Panel has delegated authority to reach the following decisions, ie that:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">i)  The student continues on the programme</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">ii)  The student continues on the programme but is cautioned, meaning that if any further fitness to practise issues arise in the following twelve months, the student will be dealt with for both matters</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">iii)  The student continues on the programme subject to fulfilment of certain conditions as specified by the Panel (which conditions can include the requirement to attend specified courses or counselling if deemed appropriate)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">iv)  The student is required to suspend study to allow time for medical investigations (for cases where unacceptable behaviour is linked to a mental health condition)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">v)  The student is required to suspend study for a period up to twelve months</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">vi)  The student is advised to transfer to an alternative programme</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">vii)  The student is asked to exit with an alternative award which does not permit the student to register with a regulatory body</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">viii)  The student is required to withdraw</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4.16 Should the student not comply with any conditions specified under Section 4.15(iii) above, a further Fitness to Practise Panel may be convened immediately to review the case and impose any further conditions or reach a different decision as the Panel deems necessary.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">5 Issues relating to health and physical ability on a programme of study</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.1 In the context of this policy statement, the requirement for an individual to be in good health does not mean that they do not have a disability or health condition. Many disabled people and those with long term health conditions are able to practice safely with or without adjustments to support their professional practice.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.2 It is recognised too that a disability may emerge after admission to a programme, that an existing health condition may worsen or that a student on a programme may acquire a disability.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.3 In considering whether or not a disability has the potential to affect a student’s fitness to practise, the Programme Leader should first discuss the student’s individual needs with the student and the Academic Disabled Student Co-ordinator to explore what extra support may be required from both the University and/or placement providers. Students with suspected disabilities and/or specific learning difficulties will be advised to contact Student Services to arrange to meet the Disability Advisor for further assessment, for example by an external agency e.g. Royal National Institute for the Blind or an Educational Psychologist.</p>\n<p>5.4 Where there is doubt about whether effective support can be provided by both the University and/or the placement provider, the matter will be discussed by the Programme Committee under Reserved Business. The Programme Committee may refer the case to the Fitness to Practise Panel, via the University Secretary.</p>\n<p>5.5 Health conditions may develop that affect fitness to practise. Short term conditions will be dealt with by the Programme Leader through the normal extenuating circumstances procedures. Where a student has missed periods of placement due to ill-health, the Programme Leader will discuss a revised programme of study with the student to allow him or her to catch up on missed work. In some cases, it may be necessary to defer study for up to a year.</p>\n<p>5.6 It is essential that students notify staff immediately should they contract a communicable disease. Normally, arrangements will be put in place in line with NHS, NMC or HCPC protocols. This will be discussed between the Programme Leader, student and placement supervisor.</p>\n<p>5.7 Mental health conditions may be short or long term. The primary responsibility of the University is to support the student to ensure the best chance of recovery. However, a decision may be taken that it is advisable to postpone periods of placement until the student’s condition has stabilised.</p>\n<p>5.8 While it is expected that the Programme Leader will attempt to support the student informally if possible, if it is judged that the student may not be safe to go on placement; or if a placement supervisor raises such a concern during placement, a referral will be made to the Fitness to Practise Panel.</p>\n<p>5.9 In the interests of a student’s and/or patient safety, the University may act to suspend a student temporarily pending the outcome of Fitness to Practise proceedings in order to remove the student from placement or prevent him or her from starting a placement.</p>\n<p>5.10 If the Student Counsellor becomes aware that a student’s medical condition may pose a risk to patient safety the Programme Leader should be informed. The terms of the University’s Counselling service client confidentiality agreement will state clearly that this is a possibility.</p>\n<p>5.11 In all the above cases, the University may require independent medical reports and / or occupational health assessments. Students may be temporarily suspended while reports are sought.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.13  A Fitness to Practise Panel will not normally be convened until reports are available. However, where a student refuses to attend an occupational health assessment, the Panel may proceed on the basis that the student has refused to provide evidence of their fitness to practise.</p>\n<p>5.14  The following decisions are possible:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">i)  The student continues on the programme</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">ii)  The student continues on the programme with suitable adjustments made to accommodate the student’s needs</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">iii)  The student continues on the programme under supervision with a time period set for review</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">iv)  The student is required to suspend study to allow time for a health condition to improve or to allow time for suitable arrangements to be put in place to accommodate the student’s needs</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">v)  The student is advised to transfer to an alternative programme</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">vi)  The student is asked to exit with an alternative award which does not permit the student to register with a regulatory body</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">vii)  The student is required to withdraw</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">6 Fitness to Practise Panel</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>6.1 A Fitness to Practise Panel may be convened to consider issues of health or character concerning an applicant to, or a student studying on, a healthcare programme leading to professional registration.</p>\n<p>6.2 The University Secretary will appoint the members of the Fitness to Practise Panel, and invite one of them to act as Convener. The University Secretary will appoint a secretary to the Panel and will arrange for a note of the proceedings to be taken. The Panel may seek advice from a qualified lawyer.</p>\n<p>6.3 The Panel will include at least one person from the profession to which the applicant or student is seeking professional registration.</p>\n<p>6.4 Normally, a Panel would include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One senior academic member of staff (convener)</li>\n<li>One NMC or HCPC representative</li>\n<li>One non-academic member (patient or lay representative)</li>\n<li>Programme Leader/designated signatory for the professional outcome or a suitable substitute suggested by the Programme Leader</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6.5  The Panel will rely only on evidence presented at the hearing.

The person who is the subject of the hearing will be advised of the date of the hearing no fewer than 14 days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing. She/he will be provided with copies of the documents being provided to the Panel, and will be invited to provide the Panel with any further information that they would wish the Panel to consider.</p>\n<p>6.10  The Panel will refuse to admit evidence that is in its opinion irrelevant to the matter under discussion.</p>\n<p>6.11  The Panel shall have power to adjourn a hearing to another date, as it thinks fit.</p>\n<p>6.12  At the termination of the proceedings, the Convener of the Panel will write a short report, summarising the discussion and setting out the Panel’s decision and reasoning. A copy of the report will be sent to the applicant/student and to the Principal.</p>\n<p>6.13  The Principal has the power to suspend the activity of the Fitness to Practise Panel at any time should they believe it appropriate to do so.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7 Right of appeal</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>7.1 An individual may appeal against the decision of a Fitness to Practise Panel.</p>\n<p>7.2 An appeal must be made to the University Secretary within twenty-eight days of the conclusion of the proceedings.

However, should a situation arise where there are concerns as to a student’s fitness to study, this policy provides both the student and the University with a procedure that allows for appropriate support to be put in place with the aim of supporting the student to continue with their studies. In rare cases, where there is not restoration of the student’s fitness to study, the student may be de-matriculated, so they can focus on recovery.</p>\n<p>The University recognises the student’s need for help and support and also for clarity about their future as a student. This procedure provides for the University promptly addressing any cases where a student’s fitness to study becomes a concern, with the intention that an early intervention may prevent situations developing into crises.</p>\n<p>The University is committed to supporting student wellbeing and recognises that a positive approach to the management of physical and mental health issues is critical to student learning, academic achievement and to the wider student experience.</p>\n<p>Fitness to study is defined as fitness to participate and to function in University life. This means that the student is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fit in respect of the abilities of the student to meet the requirements of the course and achieve relevant academic and professional goals</li>\n<li>fit in respect of the behaviours expected in an academic learning, residential and social environment;</li>\n<li>fit in respect of the ability to be more or less self-sustaining within the Higher Education environment, with the only support provided of the scale and scope that an Higher Education Institution can reasonably be expected to provide.</li>\n<li>The University also recognises that there may be instances where a student’s physical or mental health may give rise to concerns about the student’s fitness to study, for example the student’s capacity to engage with their studies and/or to function more widely as a member of the University community. Such instances may arise where, for example, the University is concerned that:</li>\n<li>a student poses a risk to their own health, safety and/or wellbeing and/ or that of others;</li>\n<li>a student’s behaviour is (or is at risk of) adversely affecting the teaching, learning and/or experience of other students;</li>\n<li>a student’s behaviour is (or is at risk of) adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of the University or a placement provider;</li>\n<li>a student’s support needs fall outside the scope of the support and other services which the University can reasonably be expected to provide either directly or indirectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Policy and Procedure sets out how the University will respond to instances where a concern is raised regarding a student’s fitness to study, and the type of action that the University may take to manage the matter and support the student.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Level 1 – Initial concerns/informal intervention within the Academic Programme</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Level 2 – Formal intervention within the Academic School</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Level 3 – Fitness to Study Panel</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Depending on individual circumstances, this procedure may be invoked at any of the three levels above. For students on Nursing and Allied Health courses, the Fitness to Practise Policy would ordinarily be invoked instead of the Fitness to Study Procedure.</p>\n<p>Students may appeal against a decision under the Fitness to Study Procedure. The procedure to do so is set out in section 4 and the appeal shall be addressed to the University Secretary.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Principles and Scope of Procedure</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1.1 This procedure is not an alternative to disciplinary action, or other relevant University procedures or policies such as the Regulations Governing Discipline or Assessment Regulations. The University reserves the right to initiate other procedures where appropriate.</p>\n<p>1.2  A student’s fitness to study may be considered despite the fact that other University processes have been invoked. Examples of other relevant procedures include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure to make satisfactory progress in academic studies (dealt with under the appropriate Assessment Regulations).</li>\n<li>Misconduct as normally defined by the University (dealt with under the Regulations Governing Discipline).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The University may refer the treatment of a student’s case out of one procedure to another to secure an appropriate response on the facts of the case but will not normally consider parallel procedures about the same substantive matter. The determination of which procedure should apply shall be made by the University Secretary.</p>\n<p>1.3  The identified serious concern(s) may relate to the presence of a diagnosed illness or disability but this procedure may also be used when there is no diagnosed illness or disability, or no notification of such a diagnosis.</p>\n<p>1.4  The Fitness to Study Procedure consists of three levels. Depending on the individual circumstances, this procedure may be invoked at any of the three levels.</p>\n<p>1.5  If the student has been given permission for deferral of studies (leave of absence), it will ordinarily be more appropriate for the Fitness to Study Procedure to be considered once the student returns to study.</p>\n<p>1.6  The principles of this policy and procedure apply to all registered students in all locations on and off campus, both in the UK and overseas.</p>\n<p>1.7  If a concern regarding fitness to study arises whilst the student is on placement, the University may discuss and consider alternative arrangements with the placement provider. If it is not possible for alternative arrangements to be made, the student’s placement may be withdrawn and deferral or other adjustments considered.</p>\n<p>1.8  All matters dealt with under this Procedure will be dealt with according to the individual circumstances. Whilst the University anticipates that such cases will be exceptional, it reserves the right at any level of this Procedure to vary the process it follows in dealing with a matter in the interests of fairness and/or health and safety (for example, in crisis situations, or where it is concerned that a student’s attendance at a meeting would be unduly stressful, or where the student is in hospital).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1.9 University staff dealing with students at any level of this Procedure will consider what support may be offered to the student both from within the University (e.g. by staff of Student Services) and externally (e.g. directing or referring students to local GPs or mental health services). Students will be encouraged to seek support where it is deemed necessary. Impartial advice about this procedure may be sought from the <a href=\"https://www.qmusu.org.uk\" title=\"QMU Student Union\">Queen Margaret University Students’ Union</a></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1.10 Students should be involved in the management of their own wellbeing wherever possible. However, should a student be unwilling or unable to participate at any level of this Procedure or to attend a meeting, the University may nonetheless follow this Procedure where it is reasonable to do so. The University may in exceptional circumstances, where it is reasonable to do so, deal with issues on the basis of written reports and/or statements in the absence of the student and/or their representative.</p>\n<p>1.11 Where in this Procedure reference is made to any named University role, such references are to be read as including reference to their nominees, or nearest equivalent where matters are being considered in partner institutions.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2 Circumstances for Support / Intervention</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2.1  The University recognises that concerns may be raised by a variety of individuals, for example University staff, other students, and third parties (such as health professionals or placement providers). This Procedure seeks to promote early intervention, active collaboration between staff, students and third parties, and consistency of approach. Matters will be dealt with sensitively and non-judgementally and in a coordinated manner across the University. Whilst the University will seek to work with students in a spirit of cooperation, cases may arise in which it may, under this Procedure, determine that a student is unfit to study and that their studies should be suspended or terminated.</p>\n<p>2.2  Serious concerns about a student’s fitness to study may present in a number of different ways. The following are some of the more common indicators that may warrant serious concern. (This is not an exhaustive list.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid deterioration in academic performance</li>\n<li>Poor attendance</li>\n<li>Lack of engagement with tutors/School</li>\n<li>Failure to respond to University communications</li>\n<li>Change in mood</li>\n<li>Poor personal hygiene</li>\n<li>Social withdrawal</li>\n<li>Emotional distress</li>\n<li>The sudden on-set of a physical difficulty or mental health problem</li>\n<li>Signs of self-harming</li>\n<li>Drug or alcohol problems</li>\n<li>Change in behaviour</li>\n<li>Police report to the University</li>\n<li>Problems in accommodation</li>\n<li>An unusually high number of Extenuating Circumstances applications</li>\n<li>A pattern of behaviour or communications which appear irrational or extremely</li>\n<li>inconsistent</li>\n<li>A pattern of unreasonable demands, which appear irrational, inappropriate or inconsistent</li>\n<li>Failure to submit work or to comply with other requirements of the programme of study.</li>\n<li>Repeated interruptions of study</li>\n<li>General failure to engage with the School, service providers or the University’s procedures, including that for Fitness to Study</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Whilst isolated incidents of the indicators do not usually constitute a case in which to initiate this Procedure, there may be serious cause for concern when there is a sustained pattern, a combination of indicators or a significant single incident.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2.3 Initiation of this Procedure at any Level does not, and must not, by itself be taken to be a justification for not proceeding with the programme of study (e.g. as to submission and marking of work) from either the student or the School’s point of view.</p>\n<p>2.4 At all stages of the Procedure, students will be able to retain support from relevant Student Services staff, but this will be limited to personal support for wellbeing. Support from staff of Student Services would not normally extend to representation or advocacy, and Student Services staff cannot attend meetings/hearings as the student’s supporter. Students may nevertheless seek support from the Students’ Union, and the Welfare and Representation Co-ordinator may attend meetings alongside students to offer support.</p>\n<p>2.5 In implementing this Procedure, the University will at all times act in accordance with its duty of care and its obligations to students under the Equality Act 2010, including in appropriate cases its obligation to make reasonable adjustments. In addition to the reasonable adjustments that may be made as a result of a needs assessment based on a known disability, there are in place a number of powers devolved to the School to make adjustments to normal academic provision for physical and mental health issues and special learning needs as well as other personal extenuating circumstances.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3 Fitness to Study Process</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Level 1 – Initial concerns: informal intervention within the academic programme</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.1  In the first instance, initial serious concerns about a student’s conduct raising fitness to study issues should normally be raised by, or addressed to, the student’s personal academic tutor or supervisor (PAT/S). If there is good reason for the PAT/S not being contacted about concerns, for instance, if there has been a breakdown in relations, the concerns should be raised with the Dean, who will nominate an alternative member of staff to act as the PAT/S for the purposes of this procedure.</p>\n<p>3.2  The PAT/S should consult the Programme Leader on the matter reported and together they may seek advice from the Head of the Student Services and/or the Dean or nominee. The PAT/S will arrange a meeting with the student – or arrange for another authorised member of staff in the academic programme to hold the meeting. The meeting is intended to be supportive in nature, fact finding and non-confrontational in order to encourage open discussion. The meeting should be held as soon as is practicable after the serious concern is identified. The PAT/S shall:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(a)  explain the Fitness to Study Procedure and at the meeting give the student a copy;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(b)  outline the concerns and provide examples where appropriate;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(c)  explain the impact on the student and, if appropriate, on others;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(d)  remind the student that fitness to study is essential for successful completion of their studies and encourage the student to co-operate and act to ensure that they are fit to study;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(e)  if appropriate, explain the extent of the University’s duty of care to make reasonable adjustments.</p>\n<p>3.3  The content and nature of the discussion will determine possible outcomes. Where appropriate, the PAT/S should propose an action plan to address and remove the concerns and secure the necessary appropriate support if any articulated at the meeting. Examples may include, but are not limited to, recommendations that the student:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>seek help from Student Services, their GP or another external service;</li>\n<li>seek advice on matters of concern;</li>\n<li>reflect on conduct;</li>\n<li>submit an Extenuating Circumstances form;</li>\n<li>complete required assessments;</li>\n<li>attend classes;</li>\n<li>submit a deferral of study application.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The action plan should clearly allocate any tasks for the student and set an equally clear timetable. The PAT/S shall keep in a confidential file a record (not verbatim) of the meeting, including details of the proposed action plan and provide a copy of this to the student. The student shall be required to indicate whether or not the action plan is agreed.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.4 The PAT/S should arrange to review the student’s case in a subsequent meeting in an agreed time period, normally of not more than one month. The key points of the review meeting will be given in writing to the student, normally 7 calendar days in advance of the review meeting.</p>\n<p>If the concerns about a student’s fitness to study have been significantly reduced and/or eliminated, no further action shall be taken, unless further concerns arise at a later date, in which case a Level 2 intervention may be appropriate.</p>\n<p>If the Level 1 intervention is unsuccessful because the student has not attended a meeting, or failed to agree the action plan, or otherwise failed to engage in the procedure, or the case is judged too serious to be addressed at Level 1, Level 2 of the procedure may be invoked.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Level 2 – Formal intervention within the academic programme</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.5  Level 2 is a more formal intervention to be used when Level 1 has not been successful or the student’s conduct or circumstances indicate that further intervention is required. It will normally be initiated by the Programme Leader, with agreement of the relevant Dean. It is recommended that the Programme Leader requests support and/or advice from the Head of the Student Services, if this was not sought during Level 1.</p>\n<p>3.6  A Level 2 intervention normally comprises a formal meeting as set out below at paragraph 3.7. The student will be given reasonable written notice of the meeting, together with information on the purpose of the meeting. The student should be requested to provide any necessary detailed information and documentation including, if appropriate, medical evidence.</p>\n<p>3.7  The meeting should normally include the Programme Leader (as meeting Chair) and the student’s PAT/S or relevant nominees. Other members of staff may be invited but attendance should be limited to those that can contribute to a possible solution. Invited attendance may include a representative from Student Services and/or Accommodation Services, or other relevant service, if appropriate. A note taker will be appointed to attend.</p>\n<p>3.8  The student may be accompanied at a Level 2 meeting by a friend or supporter, as outlined at paragraph 2.4 above.</p>\n<p>3.9  The meeting will normally proceed where the student does not attend or engage in the process, and the meeting will normally consider the case even where the student has not provided requested evidence.</p>\n<p>3.10  At the meeting, the student will be informed of the reasons for the serious concern about the student’s fitness to study, including detailed examples if appropriate. The student will be given the opportunity to ask questions and respond. A key purpose is to establish the student’s</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>perception of, or insight into, the situation and how this is impacting on the student’s wellbeing and studies and on other students and staff.</p>\n<p>3.11  The conclusions drawn from the content and nature of the discussion will determine possible outcomes. If serious concerns remain, the outcome will normally be the establishment of an action plan to address and remove the serious concerns, including the provision of any appropriate support articulated at the meeting. The meeting may, without prejudice to other conclusions, decide on one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That no further action is necessary;</li>\n<li>That it is necessary to agree an action plan with the student;</li>\n<li>That, subject to the student’s consent, it is necessary and appropriate for the Programme Leader to consider an adjustment to hours of study;</li>\n<li>That, subject to the student’s consent, it is necessary and appropriate to agree an interruption from the programme (leave of absence);</li>\n<li>That it is necessary to make a referral to Level 3 of the procedure;</li>\n<li>That it is necessary to make a referral to other University procedures, as appropriate, for example the Regulations Governing Discipline or Fitness to Practise;</li>\n<li>Other actions intended to support the student to successful completion of their studies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the student does not agree to the discussed supportive proposed outcome, the member of staff should advise the student that Level 3 action will normally be taken.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.12 The Chair of the meeting will ensure that there is a written record of the meeting and any determined actions. If an action plan is agreed, it will normally include the specification of desirable behaviour and appropriate expectations, support mechanisms, together with a date for a review meeting. If appropriate, it may also detail the consequences of non-engagement by the student. The action plan may also include a request that the student provide medical evidence in support of their fitness to study.</p>\n<p>3.13  The record and action plan will normally be sent to the student within 7 calendar days of the meeting. The student will be asked to agree to the action plan by signing and returning one copy, or by confirming their agreement by University email. A copy of the documentation will also be held on the student’s personal file.</p>\n<p>3.14  Review meetings will be convened as agreed. Attendees at review meetings may be different to those in attendance at the original level 2 meeting. The student will have the opportunity to be accompanied by a friend or supporter. A written record of the meeting shall be made and this, together with the outcome, will be given to the student normally within 7 calendar days of the review meeting and will be copied to the student’s file. For monitoring purposes, the Chair or nominee may request regular updates on the student’s progress against the action plan requirements for review.</p>\n<p>If the concerns about a student’s fitness to study have been substantially reduced and/or eliminated, it is likely that no further action will require to be taken. If the student does not abide by the provisions of the action plan, the Chair may convene a review meeting before the planned date, or escalate, as appropriate. If there is insufficient improvement following the Level 2 initial or review meetings, or there is otherwise a failure to engage in the University’s Fitness to Study Procedure or, finally the case is too serious to be addressed at Level 2, Level 3 of the procedure may be invoked.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Level 3 – Fitness to Study Panel</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.15 Level 3 is a formal intervention, normally initiated by the University Secretary, or nominated designated officer, with advice/following consultation with academic staff or staff of Student Services.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.16  Level 3 of the Fitness to Study Procedure may be initiated if any one or more of the following applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a student fails to address serious concerns about fitness to study identified at Level 2;</li>\n<li>a student’s behaviour creates further serious concern beyond that at Level 2;</li>\n<li>the circumstances presented raise particularly serious issues as to the student’s fitness to study successfully</li>\n<li>there is evidence of significant adverse impact upon, or risk to, the student or others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.17  The University Secretary will request that a Fitness to Study Panel is convened. The Panel will consist of 3 members, one of whom will normally be the Head of Student Services or designated nominee. Two other independent members of staff who have not previously been involved will be appointed, one of whom shall be invited to act as Convener of the Panel.</p>\n<p>3.18  The purpose of the Panel is to gather and assess evidence about the student’s fitness to study and to determine appropriate actions. The Convener will determine witnesses to be called upon to give evidence, including such witnesses from the following areas of the University, as are appropriate on the facts of the case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academic Programme;</li>\n<li>Residence Life Team in Accommodation;</li>\n<li>Students’ Union;</li>\n<li>Student Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secretariat support for the Panel will be provided through the relevant School Manager.</p>\n<p>3.19  The student will be given no less than 14 days written notice of the meeting. The notice will inform the student of the purpose of the meeting and, where appropriate, will request from the student detailed information as necessary, including documentary evidence as to fitness to study. The student will be informed of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their right to be accompanied to the meeting by a friend or supporter;</li>\n<li>Details of the Panel composition and those invited to attend to give evidence;</li>\n<li>The right to request witnesses to be present at the meeting. The student should provide details of the proposed witness(es) and the nature of the intended evidence they would provide.

The meeting will consider the case even where the student has not provided requested evidence. The meeting may also proceed if a witness or other invited attendee is unable to attend.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.21  After review of the case, the Fitness to Study Panel may decide that:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>no further action is necessary</li>\n<li>it is necessary to agree an action plan</li>\n<li>it is necessary to maintain or revise a previous action plan</li>\n<li>with or without the student’s consent, it is necessary and appropriate to adjust the hours of study – Programme Leader approval will be sought</li>\n<li>with the student’s consent, it is necessary and appropriate to agree an interruption from the programme (leave of absence) – Programme Leader approval will be sought</li>\n<li>without the student’s consent, it is necessary and appropriate to suspend the student’s\n<p>studies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with or without the student’s consent, it is necessary to terminate the student’s studies at the University</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>it is necessary to make a referral to other University procedures, as appropriate, for example the Regulations Governing Discipline or Code of Conduct</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>other actions intended to support the student to successful completion of their studies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.22 The Convener of the Fitness to Study Panel will ensure that there is a written record of the meeting, and any determined actions. If an action plan is agreed, it will normally include the specification of appropriate actions, including desirable behaviour or specific expectations, support mechanisms together with dates for a review meeting.

Students may apply for permission to attend if they can demonstrate that it would be unreasonable to debar them from attending their programme of study pending the appeal. Grounds for such an appeal may include, but are not limited to, a change in circumstances since the Fitness to Study hearing or the fact that the timing of an appeal hearing means that a successful appellant will be prevented from returning to study immediately because of University regulations governing registration.

Normally the student will have to tell the Ombudsman about their complaint within 12 months of first knowing about the problem about which they are complaining, although the Ombudsman may look at complaints outside this limit if they think there is good reason to do so.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.3  There are some restrictions on what the Ombudsman can investigate.

This can be sent to the Ombudsman without cost at the freepost address given below.

Subject to QMUSU agreement this interim suspension normally includes the Students’ Union. The University Secretary may determine that an interim suspension is limited to specified areas, activities and facilities of the University.</p>\n<p>6.3  Where an interim suspension has been applied, this will be subject to review every two weeks or at key stages as determined within the case management process by the University Secretary.</p>\n<p>6.4  Where a student has been subject to an interim suspension for a period of 6 weeks or more, the student has the right to apply in writing to the University Secretary for a review of the interim suspension. The student shall specify the grounds for the review. Subsequent independent reviews may be conducted where a reasonable case may be made that circumstances have changed.</p>\n<p>6.5  Throughout a period of suspension, students are not expected to engage with the University or with their studies. The exception to this may be where the student is receiving ongoing therapeutic support from staff of Student Services.</p>\n<p>6.6  Normally, imposed periods of suspension under this procedure will be for no more than one year in total. If longer periods of suspension are required, it is recommended that a student’s studies are terminated, and the student is required to re-apply for admission at a later date.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>6.7 It will be the student’s responsibility to inform the Student Funding Body (which will be different in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland), sponsor, or any other relevant person/group of any suspension.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7 Return to Study</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>7.1 If the formal outcome of the Fitness to Study case is a period of suspension/ interruption of studies (leave of absence), a return to study review will normally be initiated within a 4 week period of the expected return to study. Where appropriate, students will only be permitted to return from a period of suspension/interruption of studies (leave of absence), after receiving suitable medical or other evidence stating that the student is fit to return to study.</p>\n<p>7.2  Normally, a return to study plan will need to be agreed with the student, the authorised member of staff in the academic programme and a representative from Student Services. This should be agreed within one month of the planned return to study. The plan should include any relevant support, including, for example, specific study support, Student Services support and any other support deemed necessary for the student’s successful return to study. The student will be required to comply with all agreed actions in order to remain at the University.</p>\n<p>7.3  Following the return to study, regular review meetings should take place – these should be initiated by the authorised member of staff in the academic programme and should include representatives from the Student Services, Residence Life in Accommodation or other service, as appropriate. It is intended that the need for review meetings may cease after an agreed period but, if appropriate, these meetings may continue for the duration of the student’s study.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Medical, or other, evidence</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>7.4  If concerns are raised about a student’s fitness to study, the student is encouraged to co- operate with any reasonable request to provide medical or other evidence.

If, for example, a medical certificate states that a student is fit to study, it is nevertheless for the University and ultimately the Level 3 Panel to determine the weight to be given to the medical evidence in considering all of the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p>7.6  It is expected that no cost will be incurred in providing additional evidence. Where, in exceptional circumstances, costs are incurred in sourcing medical or other evidence, these shall be met by the student, unless otherwise agreed in writing, in advance, by the University.</p>\n<p>7.7  If a student does not provide evidence as requested, the University may nevertheless reach a decision on the case.

In this context, it is essential that assessment is both integrated into the learning experience and that it motivates the learner.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.0 Purpose of assessment</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.1 Assessment satisfies a number of related requirements, namely that it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is integrated with the process of student learning;</li>\n<li>demonstrates that a student has achieved the learning outcomes for their programme of study</li>\n<li>justifies the award of academic credit based on actual student achievement;</li>\n<li>provides confidence in the maintenance of academic standards both internally and to external stakeholders;</li>\n<li>supports the evaluation and enhancement of programme design and delivery;</li>\n<li>provides meaningful feedback and feedforward to students on their performance on a programme of study which promotes learning and encourages reflection;</li>\n<li>provides meaningful information to employers, Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies and other organisations on the knowledge and competencies of a graduate;</li>\n<li>supports the enhancement of programme design and programme delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.2 Additionally, assessment may be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the current knowledge and skills of a student and to assist in the formulation of a programme of future study.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">4.0  Principles of Assessment</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4.1 Assessment regulations and policy establish a framework for the conduct of assessment across all taught programmes.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>4.2 Assessment regulations and policy establish sound procedures for the advanced communication of assessment requirements (including assessment criteria), the submission, conduct of examinations, marking and moderation of assessments, the progression of students, the remediation of failure and the conduct of meetings of Boards of Examiners.

This applies to coursework and examinations. Feedback on course work will normally be individual. A digital copy of this pro forma will act as the archive copy of the feedback and grade awarded for that assessment.

However all students also have the right to request individual feedback from the Module Co-ordinator.</p>\n<p>4.18 A copy of student assessments and the related feedback pro formae will be kept during the time that a student is matriculated, or as specified by the University’s Records Retention Schedule.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">5.0  Fairness, reliability and validity of assessment</span></p>\n<p>5.1  Assessment can take many different forms, as dictated by the variety of programmes and learning outcomes but, in all cases it should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fair, in that there should be equality of treatment across all programmes and that there should be a consistent approach to equality and diversity;</li>\n<li>Valid, that is the assessment can be shown to be relevant to the intended learning outcomes;</li>\n<li>Reliable, in that there should be consistency of processes and standards across the institution and that there should be comparability of both the volume and complexity of assessment in relation to credit and SCQF level;</li>\n<li>Useful, in that it contributes to the knowledge and competencies and employability of the learner;</li>\n<li>Transparent, in that the requirements of the assessment in terms of intended learning outcomes and assessment criteria are made clear to the student.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.2  To maximise accuracy and fairness of assessment, programme teams are expected to follow the procedures for marking, moderation and blind double marking set out below. The terms ‘marking’, ‘moderation’ and ‘blind double marking’ are defined as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Marking - </strong>The process of assessing students’ work, taking into account QMU guidelines for assessment feedback and the relevant criteria/mark schemes as devised by programme and/or module teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderation - </strong>The process of confirming the consistency of the mark and feedback provided by the original marker(s).</p>\n<p><strong>Blind double marking - </strong>Marking conducted without access to marks, annotations or comments from any other marker. Both markers must use the relevant criteria and provide feedback to students in the agreed format.</p>\n<p>5.3  Where there are differences between first and second markers, these should be resolved through a process of discussion and negotiation. On occasions where such differences cannot be resolved through this method, the case will be referred to a third marker. A single agreed mark is provided to the student as an outcome of the above procedures.</p>\n<p>5.4  If appropriate, Examiners may adjust the raw marks attained by students in individual subjects, but the basis of the scaling must be reported to the Board of Examiners who will be asked to endorse the scaling.</p>\n<p>5.5  All assessed work should have associated marking criteria. These guides to marking should be developed simultaneously with assessment instruments and, where practicable, be approved by the External Examiner. Sharing of approved marking criteria with students is a required feature of good practice. All feedback given to students should relate to the agreed marking criteria.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">5.6  Internal moderation</span></p>\n<p>5.6.1  All elements of assessments for Honours projects and postgraduate dissertations (or equivalent) at SCQF levels 9, 10, 11and 12 must be blind double-marked for the whole cohort.</p>\n<p>5.6.2  All summative assessments for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that are not blind-double marked must be moderated on a sampling basis as a means of verifying the accuracy of marking. The size of the sample to be moderated must be at least the square root of the total number of students (rounded to the nearest whole number) taking the assessment plus all borderline fails (those that are within 2% below the pass mark). The sample should include a range of performance and the minimum size should be six pieces of assessed work.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>5.7 External Examiner moderation</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.7.1 A sample as outlined above will be reviewed by External Examiners for assessment leading to a named award.</p>\n<p>5.7.2  External Examiners will normally only be required to moderate samples for an individual module once per academic year. They will not normally be required to moderate samples for reassessments or multiple occurrences of the module provided the mode of assessment and marking team remain unchanged from the original assessment. The Board of Examiners will determine whether the External Examiner will be required to moderate additional samples for reassessment or an additional occurrence of the module.</p>\n<p>5.7.3  It is the responsibility of the Module Co-ordinator to select the sample to be reviewed by the External Examiner.

It is the responsibility of the Programme Team to consider these recommendations and take a final decision on the student mark.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">5.8 Responsibility for Assessment</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>5.8.1  In all cases Module Co-ordinators have responsibility for the conduct and quality control of assessment in their own module(s). Programme Leaders are deemed responsible for the quality of assessment across programmes and are accountable to the Head of Division through the Programme Committee. Deans of School have responsibility for assessment regulations and policy and staff development (as it affects assessment) within the parameters set by the University and any relevant Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies. It is expected, however, that this responsibility will be delegated to Heads of Division.</p>\n<p>5.8.2  School Offices are responsible for the maintenance and retention of records of all provisional marks. The Student Records Office and the School Office under the direction of the Assistant Secretary, Registry and Academic Administration, will maintain a central archive of approved final marks.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">6.0 Forms of assessment</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n6.1  The form and balance of assessment for each module should be such as to provide the most accurate assessment of the student's achievement of the module's aims, objectives and learning outcomes. Assessment may be by end-of-module assessment; or by intermittent or periodic assessment undertaken during the course of the module.\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>6.2  The module descriptor specifies the relative assessment pattern, including weightings across components. The assessment pattern must be based on the intended learning outcomes of that module.</p>\n<p>6.3  Normally assessment will relate to some or all of the learning outcomes of a single module. Where an assessment covers learning outcomes from two or more modules, this must be clearly described in the module descriptors and the method of attributing marks to each module should be clearly defined.</p>\n<p>6.4  At the commencement of each module the Module Co-ordinator must advise the enrolled students of the form of the assessment and the timing of the components which make up the assessment. This will be consistent with the overall framework established for the programme’s assessment, as specified in the module descriptors.</p>\n<p>6.5  At the start of each programme, Programme Leaders will refer students to the assessment regulations for the programme governing progression and award, and of any changes thereto.</p>\n<p>6.6  The University operates a Student Attendance Policy which can be found on the University’s <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/\" title=\"Regulations, Policies and Procedures Website\">Regulations, Policies and Procedures web page</a>.</p>\n<p>Additional attendance and participation conditions may be in place for some programmes, but must be made clear to students.

themselves with the regulations for their programme. Students should consult their Programme Handbook and/or their Academic Tutor;</li>\n<li>recognise the role of assessment in the achievement and recognition of their learning;</li>\n<li>familiarise themselves with the examination periods (both first attempt and reassessment and make themselves available for the examination period);</li>\n<li>attend written examinations and observe the University’s Instruction to Candidates in Examinations (to be read out to students prior to the start of examinations). In brief, these require candidates to attend in good time, to bring their matriculation card, not to communicate with other candidates, not to cheat, not to disrupt the event, to complete the answer paper as instructed, not to bring into the hall any unauthorised material and not to remove any part of an answer paper from the hall;</li>\n<li>attend all other types of assessment, for example, practical examinations, class tests and presentations;</li>\n<li>submit all work for assessment in accordance with the requirements for their programme;</li>\n<li>provide evidence, in advance of the Board of Examiners, of any extenuating circumstances. This evidence is normally written by an independent source such as a medical practitioner and should be forwarded to the School Office in the first instance. Students should be aware that Boards of Examiners will take account of all certificated or verified evidence submitted on behalf of students in their deliberations on individual performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>21.2 If a student fails to attend examinations or submit work for assessment without good cause, the Board of Examiners has the authority to deem the student to have failed the assessments concerned.</p>\n<p>21.3 Students are not permitted to substantially reproduce the same piece of course work for more than one assignment, except where they are explicitly required to do so by the assignment specification.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>21.4 If a student is found to have cheated, or attempted to gain an unfair advantage, the Board of Examiners, following a recommendation from the Dean or Disciplinary Panel, has authority to deem the student to have failed part or all of the assessment and to determine whether or not the student shall be permitted to be re-assessed. Students must ensure the proper acknowledgement of the borrowings from other sources, whether published or unpublished. Divisions should provide guidance on how such borrowings should be acknowledged in a manner appropriate to that discipline.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Fraudulent practices such as copying, cheating, collusion, plagiarism (i.e. the presentation by an individual of another person’s ideas or work, in any medium, published or unpublished, as though they were their own) are serious academic offences and will incur appropriate penalties. Students must not submit work obtained from an essay bank or website essay writing service. Students are urged to seek advice from academic staff or the Effective Learning Service if in any doubt about the foregoing practices. All students are expected to seek clear guidance on the form and manner in which assessments are to be completed.</p>\n<p>21.5 Serious cases of cheating and plagiarism will be referred for consideration through the University’s disciplinary procedure.

Staff should note that ‘working days’ equates to Monday to Friday, excluding University closure dates, i.e. part-time working or periods of annual leave should not result in an extension to the 15/20 working day maximum. The maximum of 15/20 working days includes all stages within the marking process (i.e. marking, cross-marking, collation of marks and feedback, sending marks and feedback to the School Office, dissemination of marks and feedback to students by the School Office) and applies to all staff, including Visiting Lecturers.</li>\n<li>clearly specifying the date by which a student can expect to receive feedback on each summative assignment. This date must be communicated to the student at the same time as the assessment deadline.

Such warnings should be repeated during the session and are especially necessary where dissertations, projects or coursework are substantial elements of the curriculum. Every opportunity should be taken to reinforce this message by incorporating it in published material such as Programme or scheme guides and, in the case of postdoctoral candidates, by its inclusion in the Research Degrees Code of Practice/Doctoral Candidate Handbooks (PhD and Professional Doctorate).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>24.3.2 These warnings should be accompanied by specific advice from Divisions about what constitutes plagiarism and academic fraud. For example, such advice should indicate where a particular discipline makes the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate use of acknowledged or unacknowledged sources; what is regarded as acceptable collaboration between students undertaking joint project work; and what is expected of a dissertation or thesis. Dissertations should clearly indicate whether it is an original contribution to knowledge or a critical survey of published material. Training students to make such distinctions is part of the academic process and should be formally and publicly acknowledged as such. This is particularly significant since some of the cases arising stem from genuine ignorance on the part of the students who have never received guidance on how to acknowledge sources properly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>24.3.3  Scrutiny of academic work should be sufficient to ensure that signs of plagiarism or unacceptable levels of co-operation, whether intentional or not, are detected at an early stage and brought to students’ attention through tutorial guidance and in some cases perhaps by written warning.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>24.3.4  Dissertation supervisors and other academic staff responsible for assessment and guidance should be aware of cultural relativities that may affect some students’ approach to referencing.

Our ambition is that QMU research and knowledge is translated by the people and organisations most able to influence policy and inform practice, to make a positive difference to everyday life.</p>\n<p>Whilst in UK law the University owns legal title over intellectual property (IP) produced by its staff in their work, QMU recognises that staff and their collaborators are often best placed to develop their research into new products and applications which offer solutions to prospective end-users. Intellectual Property is also an asset class that is valuable to the University and individual researchers in their designated University role, and it may have commercial value. QMU believes that researchers should have free, uninhibited access to the IP they have generated during their research except in specific circumstances which might disadvantage the University – these are set out below in Section 2. The University aims to support both staff and the University’s use of University-generated IP and promote access for other parties use of that IP to help develop practical, user-centric, beneficial applications.</p>\n<p>“Intellectual property” covers all IP, including but not limited to all inventions, designs, information, specifications, formulae, improvements, discoveries, know-how, data, processes, methods, techniques and the IP rights therein, including but not limited to patents, copyrights, database rights, design rights (registered and unregistered), trademarks, trade names and service marks and the right to apply for any of the above as recognised in any country in the world. For the avoidance of doubt, IP shall not include any personal data (as defined in the General Data Protection Regulations 2018) of which the University is the data controller (“Personal data”). The University will retain ownership of all Personal data and this Policy is not intended to authorise any other party to process such Personal Data without the consent and authorisation of the University.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2 Intellectual Property Ownership</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The general rule in relation to IP created by an employee during the course of their employment is that, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, the first owner is the employer. This position arises due to statutes governing intellectual property. In the case of inventive products and processes, the Patents Act 1977 confers first ownership of an invention created by an employee to the employer. In relation to copyright works and registered and unregistered design rights (copyright works being literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works), the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, the Registered Designs Act 1949 and the Regulation on Community Designs (6/2002/EC) all operate to confer ownership of copyright works and UK and EU designs created by an employee to the employer. Similarly, the first owner of database rights in a database will be the employer pursuant to the Copyright, Rights in Databases Regulations 1997.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Whilst the de facto legal position is that the University owns the IP arising from work undertaken by its employees, this University Intellectual Property Policy modifies the position of IP ownership at QMU for staff and students as follows.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">a. Staff</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\nAll IP generated by staff during the course of their employment by the University and/or using University resources (“Staff IP”) will be owned by the inventor (the member of staff who creates the IP), except:\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Where as a condition of support an external funder providing funding or other support requires that Staff IP is assigned to that external sponsor; or</li>\n<li>Where the Staff IP has been developed in the production of a course or teaching materials, in which cases the Staff IP will be owned by the University.</li>\n<li>Exceptionally, and only at the point at which potential IP is disclosed (see Section 5), the University identifies that the commercial opportune would be best realised by a traditional model of IP exploitation led by the University. In such cases, after the University has recovered the direct costs incurred by it for any registration of IP rights and all costs incurred for exploitation, remaining revenues will be shared equally between the University and the inventors (50% each)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event where any of the exceptions above are considered by the University to apply, the staff member shall execute and deliver such documents and perform such acts as may reasonably be required in order to ensure that ownership of Staff IP is assigned to the correct party, as set out above. In certain cases, the University may require the staff member to sign an agreement formally assigning IP to the University.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">b.

Joint ownership requires more ongoing management and should only apply where the contributions of each inventor are not distinct and cannot be separated. Joint inventors are best placed to agree between themselves how Joint IP should be protected and how any revenue generated be shared, and the University would not normally expect to be involved in any negotiations between the inventors on the issues surrounding Joint IP.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3 University responsibilities for Intellectual Property</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University shall not give any warranties or assume liability for any uses of, or dealings in, Staff IP or Student IP which has been created at the University but assigned to any staff member or student under this policy.</p>\n<p>The relevant staff member or student shall be solely responsible for any protection, commercialisation and exploitation of Staff IP or Student IP respectively and must make clear that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the University has no ownership interest in the relevant IP; and</li>\n<li>they are not authorised to act or incur obligations and/ or liability on the University’s behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As noted in Section 2, the University will retain ownership of IP in relation to course or teaching materials generated by students and staff. The University will also register its IP where appropriate through trademarks, patents and/or registered designs to protect its IP, trading names and teaching &amp; research objectives where this is deemed appropriate. The University will monitor the use of this and any other IP belonging to the University and reserves the right to defend its IP in circumstances where their misuse or infringement would, or is likely to create reputational, financial or other damage to the University.</p>\n<p>The University shall continue to store and make publicly available data generated by research, in line with evolving policy on this issue. The University shall also continue to make research publications by staff accessible to a wide audience through use of the institutional repository of publications and requires that staff place their publications on this repository.</p>\n<p>In relation to any grant of rights, licences, warranties or undertakings sought by any person in relation to IP owned by or licenced to the University, these shall only be granted subject to the University’s approval procedures. No member of staff or any student is authorised to give or purport to give any such grant, licence, warranties and/or undertakings on the University’s behalf.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">4 Staff and Student’s Responsibilities for Intellectual Property</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The University has provided support to staff and students in the development of both Staff and Student IP and has a responsibility to promote new research and knowledge exchange.

Any deliberate removal or attempted removal of an item without complying with this procedure constitutes an offence and renders the user liable to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>3.4  Users will be held responsible for all items issued on their QMU Smart Card until they are returned to the LRC and duly discharged.</p>\n<p>3.5  Books and other items of LRC stock which have been issued on a QMU Smart Card may not be transferred from one LRC user to another.</p>\n<p>3.6  Current loan periods must be observed at all times, and items returned by the date and time specified.</p>\n<p>3.7  It is the responsibility of the user to return all items by dates and times specified. Reminder notices are a courtesy, not an entitlement (see Appendix 1).</p>\n<p>3.8  Email will be the standard means by which communications from the LRC are delivered. Email will only be sent to a QMU email address.</p>\n<p>3.9  When returning items, these must be discharged at the Self Service facility or handed to a member of LRC staff during staffed hours. Users returning LRC materials, issued on their QMU Smart Card, must not leave them unattended in the LRC, whether at the LRC Service Desk, or anywhere else in the LRC. LRC materials remain the responsibility of the user until they are duly discharged. When returning items via the self service machines, it is the responsibility of the user to check the screen and make sure that items are discharged from their record.</p>\n<p>3.10  Fines are levied on all users for the late return of items. Users who fail to return items will be invoiced for the accumulated fines, the cost of replacement and an administration charge. Users who have such an 'account' on their QMU Smart Card will have their borrowing privileges suspended until all accounts are cleared to the satisfaction of the Head of Library Services.</p>\n<p>3.11  University users who are in debt to the LRC, due to non-payment of fines or through failure to clear accounts on their LRC record, by the end of their course may have their degree certificate withheld and/or will not be allowed to graduate.</p>\n<p>3.12  Loans of the print stock are auto-renewed unless required by another user. However, if requested by another user, items must be returned within the time period stated on the recall notice. Recalls are sent by email to the user’s QMU email address only.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.13  A reservation or 'hold' may be placed on most items that are currently on loan. Users will be notified when the item becomes available and it will be held for 'pickup' for 7 days.</p>\n<p>3.14  Users will be notified if any item issued on their QMU Smart Card is required by another user. These items will no longer be eligible for renewal and must be returned by the date and time specified.</p>\n<p>3.15  Any user who fails to return a book, knowing that it is in demand, may be required to pay the costs of replacing it and will be liable to suspension of further borrowing privileges.</p>\n<p>3.16  Lost or stolen QMU Smart Cards must be reported to Security and to the LRC Helpdesk immediately.

Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is already provided through the main institutional Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), Blackboard, also referred to as the Hub.</p>\n<p>Lecture capture further enhances the capabilities of the existing VLE by giving lecturers the capacity to record, edit and enrich their live and pre-recorded content (often referred to as synchronous and asynchronous) and release it to students via the relevant module Hub sites.</p>\n<p>In 2018, 75% of UK universities reported using lecture recording in some form.[1] COVID-19 has likely accelerated what was already an upward trend of lecture recording use across the sector. In June 2020, the Students’ Union (QMUSU) published the results to their student experience survey which highlighted the positive engagement students had with recorded lectures during the initial stages of the lockdown. This was emphasised by the corresponding data which showed that 63.7% of students want recorded lecture content provision to continue after pandemic restrictions are lifted.[2]</p>\n<p>Lecture capture is normally a supplementary resource which is used to support learning and not as a substitute to replace live lectures. Research shows that lecture capture viewing fails to compensate for the impact that low attendance has on attainment.[3] Soong et al. (2006) also found that access to recorded lectures did not diminish students’ preference for face-toface lectures.[4] There are several benefits of lecture capture for students:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1. Access to recorded lectures can lead to more positive results and learning behaviours.[5]</p>\n<p>2. Students will have more flexibility and control over their learning and gain the capacity to watch recorded lectures at a wider range of times, locations, and speeds.[6]</p>\n<p>3. Students can use the recordings as a tool for revision ahead of exams and other assessments.[7] 4. It offers an alternative platform for students who are anxious about learning in live lectures.</p>\n<p>5. Recorded lectures provide additional support to students who are non-native speakers of English.[9]</p>\n<p>6. Lecture recording can assist with distance learning and help provide more parity in learning experiences.[10]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>7. It allows students to view specific sections of recordings to reinforce their understanding of complex theories and concepts.[11]</p>\n<p><strong>Lecture capture can also benefit staff:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Lecture capture can be used for self-reflection and evaluation, helping the lecturer to adapt pedagogy and/or improve communication skills.[12]</p>\n<p>2. Moving lecture content online can open-up more space for active learning during live sessions on campus.</p>\n<p>3. Lecture capture software offers a useful set of tools to enable the lecturer to produce more engaging and dynamic digital resources.</p>\n<p>4. Lecturers gain access to user analytics. This enables the lecturer to see what and how often students are engaging with course content, thereby helping to gauge interest or areas of detachment.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">POLICY</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2 Lecture Capture Policy Principles</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.1 General Principles</span></p>\n<p>2.1.1 Lecture capture is adopted to enhance the student experience and this principle should guide all others related to the technology and the way it is used.</p>\n<p>2.1.2 The University will not use recordings to assess staff performance or to instigate disciplinary hearings or complaints. However, they may be used (with the permission of the lecturer) as evidence in such hearings. Management may also access recorded lectures where this is permitted in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act (e.g. for law enforcement purposes).</p>\n<p>2.1.3 The University will provide users with appropriate training and guidance in using the technology.</p>\n<p>2.1.4 If a member of staff has a disability which impacts on their use of the Lecture Capture technology, they are asked to discuss any reasonable adjustments with their line manager in the first instance.</p>\n<p>2.1.5 Lecture capture will not be used to replace multiple teaching of large cohorts, or as a substitute for the availability of academic staff due to, e.g. industrial action.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.2 Under normal operating conditions</span></p>\n<p>2.2.1 The Lecture Capture policy adopts an opt-in approach for staff. This means that staff have the choice to have their classes recorded or not. Staff who choose to record their class will be required to initiate the recording process.</p>\n<p>2.2.2 Control over access and use of recorded teaching material rests with the member of staff (refer to section 4 on performance rights).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>2.2.3 Lecture capture takes place only for events categorised in the timetable as lectures. 2.2.4 As a minimum, audio and screen are captured, recording video is optional.</p>\n<p>2.2.5 Recorded content is available to students for two academic years, and archived for the lifetime of the module. This ensures a student has access to the recordings if resitting the module. It also enables staff who have recorded their lectures to access, use or repurpose their recordings in the subsequent academic session.</p>\n<p>2.2.6 Where lecture capture is implemented, students are clearly informed of the risks to their academic attainment of an over-reliance on the service as a substitute for lecture attendance.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2.3 Under extraordinary operating conditions</span></p>\n<p>If the Business Continuity Group or equivalent declares that extraordinary conditions exist, then these principles may be adapted to allow for appropriate adjustments to be made that ensure teaching provisions are met. Any adjustments made should be appropriate and proportionate to the prevailing conditions (e.g. the choice to opt-in may be removed if face to face on campus delivery of lecture materials is not possible) to ensure that teaching can take place:</p>\n<p>2.3.1 The opt-in approach may be temporarily removed in circumstances whereby it might impede the delivery of teaching e.g. where online teaching is the only option available.</p>\n<p>2.3.2 The range of events that are categorised as being appropriate for lecture capture may be broadened if the prevailing circumstances demand it.</p>\n<p>2.3.3 Guidance on what may be recorded (video/audio/screen) may be adapted where appropriate.</p>\n<p>2.3.4 Content may be held for longer than two academic years, if the prevailing circumstances demand it. An important purpose of that retention is to enable staff who have recorded their lectures to access, use or repurpose their recordings in subsequent academic sessions.</p>\n<p>2.3.5 Advice to students on the proper use of the service should be appropriate to the prevailing circumstances.</p>\n<p>2.3.6 Any aspects of the policy that have been adapted due to extraordinary operating conditions are time limited; the Business Continuity Group must agree and announce an expiry date for any adapted policy articles.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3 Opt-in approach</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.1 Under normal operating conditions</span></p>\n<p>3.1.1 QMU aims to adopt a philosophy of voluntarism in its approach to lecture capture and recognises that not all teaching staff will wish to use the technology.</p>\n<p>3.1.2 The decision to record teaching material and make it available to students will rest with the individual member of staff.</p>\n<p>3.1.3 The decision to opt-in or otherwise should have no detriment to the member of staff from the student body or from management. This is a professional choice and should be respected.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.1.4 Decisions made by individual staff concerning lecture capture should be clearly communicated to all students on the module and this should take place as early as possible.</p>\n<p>3.1.5 Normally, staff should aim to upload recordings within seven days of the timetabled event taking place.</p>\n<p>3.1.6 Staff may edit recordings as they wish, but it is not expected that recordings be edited before uploading. The exception to this is if data contravenes General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or includes sensitive information.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.2 Under extraordinary operating conditions</span></p>\n<p>3.2.1 As set out in section 2.3 the opt-in approach may be adapted under extraordinary operating conditions. Where this is the case, the policy on opt-in will be guided by the Business Continuity Group (or equivalent) and a temporary set of policies will be adopted that are appropriate for the prevailing conditions.</p>\n<p>3.2.2 In such situations, it is the responsibility of the Business Continuity Group to communicate to the relevant parties the nature of the changes in policy, the reasons for the changes in policy, and the expected expiry date of the amended policy items.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3.3 Covid-19 specific policy</span></p>\n<p>3.3.1 In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, QMU has indicated that a significant proportion of teaching will be in the form of asynchronous online lectures.</p>\n<p>3.3.2 As such, the opt-in policy will not apply while the University is responding to the pandemic. During this period, recording of teaching materials for online consumption will become mandatory for all appropriate classes. Exceptions to this are when an agreement exists between the member of teaching staff and their line manager that the material can be delivered in other formats, where this does not conflict with other institutional policies (both specific to the pandemic and more generally).</p>\n<p>3.3.3 Recordings should be made available sufficiently in advance of when students are expected to have viewed them by, to enable students to engage with the recording at a time that suits their personal circumstances (e.g. access to the internet, caring responsibilities, time zone differences etc.).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">4 Intellectual property, copyright, performer’s rights and retention period</span></p>\n<p>4.1 In the absence of agreement to the contrary, the University owns the intellectual property in all the teaching materials that staff generate or create whilst working for or at QMU.</p>\n<p>4.2 Performance rights reside with the performer(s), who agree to the recording of the lecture and approve that it is used for teaching purposes as detailed in this policy.

Students and staff should be aware that accuracy is around 92%. Where 100% accuracy is required e.g. for students with a hearing impairment or others with an ILP, some manual editing of the generated transcriptions may be necessary. These will be provided by the University in conjunctionwith the student’s ADSC/Disability Adviser as part of their reasonable adjustments.</p>\n<p>5.2.4 Where Lecture Capture is not available, and the lecture has not been specifically exempted from Lecture Capture, the University allows students to record audio with the prior permission of the lecturer.

In the normal course of events, students will be required to apply for “Standard Disclosure” before entry to a programme. The existence of a criminal record itself does not mean that a student is unable to join a programme, but admission to particular programmes may be precluded by certain types of convictions.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3 RECOGNITION OF PRIOR LEARNING (RPL)</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.1  Individual students may be admitted to an advanced stage of a programme, provided that they have demonstrably reached the same general standard of educational development as achieved through earlier level(s) of the programme. There should also be a reasonable probability that prospective students will complete the programme successfully within its normal duration. Where other studies are used as the basis for selection, the Programme Leader or Admissions Tutor will have discretion to determine if it is necessary for each component in the omitted level(s) of the programme to be shown to have been covered.</p>\n<p>3.2  Where admission to a level has been granted, students may further apply for specific credits as set out below. However, any credit approved under RPL and based on a specific episode of prior learning can be used only once on any programme of study.</p>\n<p>3.3  The Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) describes the use of prior learning, either as<br />a formative tool as part of personal development or as a summative tool for the award of credit. The learning may have taken place either as part of a formal educational course or as part of an informal life or work experience outside formal educational settings. This acknowledges that there may be a stage of discussion, reflection and formative assignments, prior to any formal application for the accreditation of prior learning.</p>\n<p>3.4  The Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) refers to the process whereby students are awarded credit towards an award on the basis of previous learning, which may be either certificated learning or experiential learning.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.5  APL can be used either as a means of demonstrating the achievement of entry level or for gaining credit that can be transferred as either general or specific credit towards a programme of study.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.6  The application will be assessed by the University in terms of its:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authenticity - that the applicant actually completed what is claimed.</li>\n<li>directness - that the learning was specific and can be identified and categorised.</li>\n<li>sufficiency - that learning reached a level to allow the applicant to fulfil the learning outcomes of the programme.</li>\n<li>currency - that the learning is sufficiently recent to allow the applicant to fulfil learning outcomes of the programme. Where experience from some time previously is referred to in a substantial way, e.g. more than five years has elapsed, the application will be assessed to determine whether the applicant has kept up to date with recent developments in the intended field of study.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.7  The Accreditation of Prior Certificated Learning (APCL) refers to the recognition of prior learning gained from a formal course that has been previously assessed and/or accredited at higher education level.</p>\n<p>3.8  The Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) refers to the process of assessing and credit-rating learning achieved outside formal education settings.</p>\n<p>3.9  The usual minimum credit that can be awarded is 10 credits in the case of undergraduate Programmes, and 15 credits for postgraduate programmes. For the purpose of awarding credit, smaller volumes of learning may be incorporated into a single summative assessment submitted for the award of credit.</p>\n<p>3.10  The University will grant specific credit to students by matching evidence provided by<br />the student which demonstrates that they have fulfilled the learning outcomes of specified full modules in a validated programme on which they are registered. Students given specific credit for a module will then be exempted from this module and prohibited from undertaking a similar module.</p>\n<p>3.11  Students may possess general credit awarded by other institutions for previous<br />studies. Part of these studies may be specifically recognised and given specific credit towards a programme of the University on the basis that they meet the requirements of a Queen Margaret University award.</p>\n<p>3.12  The level and volume of general credit should be assessed based on the relevant<br />level descriptors of the SCQF. Although the volume of credit is not a simple mathematical judgement, one credit point is approximately equivalent to 10 hours of learning, including all learning activities, application through work based activity, reflection and assessment.</p>\n<p>3.13  Students may be exempted from attendance in respect of part of a module where they<br />can demonstrate prior learning of some but not all of the learning outcomes of that module. In such circumstances, students will be summatively assessed against the learning outcomes of the full module.</p>\n<p>3.14  The only exception is where a programme option or elective exists. Specific credit<br />can be given on the basis of previous learning without precise matching of module learning outcomes, provided that students achieve the overall outcomes for an award.</p>\n<p>3.15  The student’s claim for credit for a specific module may be assessed in a number of possible ways, and in the following order of preference. The student can:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>provide evidence of passing an equivalent module elsewhere;</p>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>undertake the normal module assessment;</li>\n<li>undertake an oral examination;</li>\n<li>undertake another form of assessment, e.g. a challenge essay;</li>\n<li>complete an approved learning contract;</li>\n<li>submit a portfolio of evidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.16  Where credit is awarded, it should be for evidence of the achievement of learning arising from the experience and not for the experience alone.</p>\n<p>3.17  A student’s claim for credit for a specific module should be assessed by the same staff member who would normally assess performance on that module, unless that member of staff has previously acted as academic advisor to the student.</p>\n<p>3.18  The record of the assessment of prior learning should be open to independent scrutiny by the same external examiners who assess performance on the specific modules or academic award. The evidence submitted by students of prior experiential learning in support of a claim must be available for scrutiny by external examiners. Boards of Examiners should be notified of those credits on student transcripts arising from APL.</p>\n<p>3.19  At least 50 per cent of the level at which a student enters a programme must be completed at Queen Margaret University in order to gain an award from the University. Classification of awards may make use of grades given for prior learning: for APCL, those grades are those given by the institution where the prior learning was accredited (adjusted to allow for differences in marking criteria); for APEL, those grades may be given by Queen Margaret University.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>3.20  As part of its programme review and annual monitoring processes, QMU may require programme teams to monitor, review and report on their use of the policies and procedures for APL.</p>\n<p>3.21  An approved learning contract may be used by a student to gain credit, based on an agreed piece of current independent learning. The credit gained may be general or specific. Learning contracts may be incorporated into individual or independent study modules.</p>\n<p>3.22  Where a learning contract is used for the award of specific credit, the contract should indicate how the specific learning outcomes of the module(s) are to be demonstrated.</p>\n<p>3.23  Where a learning contract is used for general credit, the choice of learning outcomes, together with the volume and level of credit should be made with reference to the SCQF framework.</p>\n<p>3.24  A learning contract should include statements of: the level and volume of credit, the aims and learning outcomes, a plan of activities, details of evidence to be submitted by the student (report, essay, video, portfolio etc.), a marking scheme and a time plan.</p>\n<p>3.25  The contract should be dated and signed by the student, the lecturer supervising the student and the programme leader (plus the representative of any external body in the case of work- based learning).

This includes students who have been required, or have chosen, to withdraw from a programme, and who have not been granted a deferment of study. Students who have voluntarily withdrawn may be re-admitted for a higher award through the University's normal admissions procedures. Students who have been required to withdraw may be re-admitted through the University's normal admissions procedures a minimum of one year after the decision of the Boards of Examiners.

They may with the agreement of the Programme Leader register on modules rated to a total of 100, 110, 130, 140 credits in one academic year. In exceptional circumstances, the Board of Examiners may recommend registration on up to 160 credit points in cases where a student is required to carry forward modules. Further, with the additional agreement of the funding body, they may register on modules rated to a total of 80 or 90 credits. Students registering on modules rated to a total of 70 credits or fewer will for all purposes be considered as part-time students.</p>\n<p>5.2  The selection of an individual programme of study is the ultimate responsibility of the student subject to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the rules determining pre-requisites and co-requisites for modules;</li>\n<li>the availability each year of modules, and their time-tabling;</li>\n<li>the advice provided by staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5.3  The choice of a student's programme of study is determined by the regulations set out in the programme definitive document in terms of the compulsory modules and the pre-requisites. Boards of Examiners may advise on, but may not determine, a student's subsequent programme of study.</p>\n<p>5.4  A part-time student allowed to continue in registration and wishing to transfer to full-time study will have her or his application considered by the programme's Admissions Tutor.

Such change requires the approval of the Programme Leader(s) and Module Co-ordinators. This acts as a check that the student has a good reason for the change, the revised programme is still coherent, the necessary prerequisite qualifications are fulfilled, and that the registration period is still within the minimum and maximum allowed period.</p>\n<p>6.2  If a student withdraws from a module before 25% of the taught duration has elapsed, they will be treated as never having been on the module. No fee will be charged.</p>\n<p>6.3  If a student wishes to withdraw from a module after 25% of the taught duration has elapsed they will be treated as having registered on the module and will be charged a fee.</p>\n<p>6.4  A student withdrawing from a module after 25% of the taught duration has elapsed may provide the module co-ordinator with a written explanation of reasons for withdrawal. If the module co-ordinator accepts these as valid extenuating circumstances, the student will suffer no academic penalty, i.e. the withdrawal will not count as a fail. The student will receive a transcript showing them as withdrawn and will receive no credit.</p>\n<p>6.5  A student withdrawing from a module after 25% of the taught duration without providing evidence of extenuating circumstances will be recorded as a fail.</p>\n<p>6.6  A student wishing to transfer from one elective module to another will normally be permitted to do so within the first 25% of the taught duration of the module subject to the consent of both Module Co-ordinators. Only exceptionally will students be permitted to transfer between elective modules after this period.</p>\n<p>6.7  For the purpose of these regulations the term \"module\" is understood to cover all integrally assessed programme components, whether designed in a modular format or not, i.e. it includes projects and placements where these are assessed.</p>\n<p>6.8  Applications from students wishing to follow a programme of study leading to a general award of MSc, MA, MBA, MFA, PgDip or PgCert will be vetted by the School Academic Board or by the Programme Committee to ensure that the chosen programme exhibits relevance, academic coherence, and has the potential to lead to a dissertation in an area suitable to the level of award, appropriate to the interests and expertise of staff.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">7  CHOICE OF STUDY PROGRAMME – POSTGRADUATE STUDY</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>7.1  Within the regulations set down for the Masters Programme overall and for particular awards, it is intended that the student will choose her/his own programme.</p>\n<p>7.2  A student's choice of dissertation is subject to the agreement of the Programme Committee/Subject Area Panel and the dissertation supervisor. This agreement is given on the authority of the School Academic Board.</p>\n<p>7.3  The specific agreement of the School Academic Board is needed by a student who designs a study programme which is undefined in subject area content and which leads to the award of a general Masters degree (MFA, MSc or MA).</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>7.4  It is expected that students will choose programmes and modes of study appropriate to their own particular needs.

Attendance requirements for the satisfaction of a professional or registration body and on any modules should be clearly identified in the programme's student handbook. Programme attendance policies should be developed in consultation with module co-ordinators, where modules are accessed by students from various programmes.

ASSOCIATE STUDENTS</span></p>\n<p>9.1  Students may be admitted to a module or modules or to a part of a programme as an Associate Student, without registering for an award. As with all other students their matriculation is undertaken by the University Secretary’s Group.</p>\n<p>9.2  Where associate students are supplementary to an existing class and can be taught without the need for additional resources, approval for their admission will normally be given by the Head of Division responsible for the modules for which the students wish to register. However, where the number of associate students registered on a particular module is large, a special arrangement covering fees and additional resources for teaching and defined access to facilities on campus should be negotiated and agreed by the Dean of School. Such arrangements will apply where a separate class is provided or where special provision is made for teaching off-campus.</p>\n<p>9.3  It will normally be the responsibility of the module co-ordinator to ensure that associate students fulfil the pre-requisites of any module on which they are registered.</p>\n<p>9.4  Associate students will follow the same curriculum and, if they wish to be assessed, they will be assessed in the same way as (and usually together with) students taking the module who are registered for an award. The same Board of Examiners shall, at the same meeting, consider the results of all students assessed for a given module. The grades achieved in the assessment will be recorded and students will be eligible for an academic transcript.</p>\n<p>9.5  Associate students have access to the same appeals, disciplinary and complaints procedures as other students.</p>\n<p>9.6  The standard of the teaching will be assessed through the use of QMU teaching staff and the QMU Board of Examiners. Should students use facilities in another establishment, the Programme Leader responsible for the module in QMU should lodge an affirmation with the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement to the effect that the conditions and facilities are conducive to the proper pursuit of the module.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>9.7  Associate students will normally be charged the fee for the module taken or a pro-rata fee in relation to the portion of a programme being followed, and have access to all the University facilities.</p>\n<p>9.8 A student can study as an 'associate student' for a maximum period of 2 years, or for 2 modules.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

It has a duty to do all that is reasonably practicable to provide and maintain a working and learning environment that is safe for all, without risk to health and is adequate as regards facilities and arrangements for their welfare at work. It also has a duty to control the risks to people not in its employment which arise from the operation of its business. The University shall protect non-smokers from the risks to health from passive smoking and protect all users of the University’s premises and property from increased risk of fire. Reducing the number of potential sources of ignition can only assist in achieving this goal.</p>\n<p>As of the 26 May 2006 smoking was prohibited in all workplaces, in terms of the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>\n<p>The law prohibits smoking in certain public places which are ‘wholly or substantially enclosed’, including the majority of workplaces. It is an offence to smoke in no smoking premises or to knowingly permit smoking in no smoking premises. The University faces a fixed penalty fine of £200 for allowing anyone to smoke on the premises and individuals can face a personal fine of £50 for smoking. Failure to pay or repeated offences can result in prosecution and a fine of £2,500. Vehicles used for business purposes are also be affected by the law.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of clarity the use of e-cigarettes is included in the definition of smoking.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3 Objectives</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>This Policy has been developed with the following objectives in mind:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To protect all employees, students and visitors from exposure to second-hand smoke;</li>\n<li>To assist compliance with the Smoking Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005;</li>\n<li>To reduce the risk of fire within the University;</li>\n<li>To reflect a renewed emphasis on fire risk assessment in respect of potential harm caused by fire in the workplace as per the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">4.

Promoting and encouraging student engagement with all aspects of their learning experience is a key aspect of this. This policy has been developed to provide a supportive learning environment of which student attendance is one aspect of overall engagement. The University needs to be able to record the attendance of students at timetabled teaching sessions for the following reasons:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>a. To aid the retention of students by allowing early identification of those students at risk and allow timely interventions to be made in terms of academic and personal support.</p>\n<p>b. To comply with the requirements of the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) under our Tier 4 licence that requires us to record the attendance accurately of those students subject to visa restrictions so that an attendance return can be made within specified timescales required by the agency.</p>\n<p>c. To comply with the requirements of the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) who require attendance confirmations to be made on a regular basis for those students who are in receipt of SAAS financial support.</p>\n<p>d. To enable timely notifications of withdrawals and deferrals to external stakeholders (e.g. UKVI, SAAS).</p>\n<p>e.

Student welfare is a priority for Queen Margaret University.
