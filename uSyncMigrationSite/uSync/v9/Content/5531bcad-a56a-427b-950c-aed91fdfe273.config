You will thrive in our supportive environment, and benefit from placements each year along with practical experience in our specialist facilities on campus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Our course is designed to allow you to get to know your peers and our staff, and build positive academic and professional relationships. Teaching and learning methods include interactive lectures, seminars, practical workshops, group work and self-directed learning. Outside timetabled sessions, you will be expected to continue learning through independent study. For assessment, we focus less on written examinations and more on demonstrations of knowledge and understanding: reports, essays, presentations, oral and practical examinations, and creative assessments.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements provide the opportunity to integrate practice with theory. A practice placement is offered in each year. You will work with individuals, groups and communities in a variety of settings. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of full-time placements for each student.</p>\n<p>Placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or caring responsibilities) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by our Master of Occupational Therapy (MOccTh)/BSc (Hons) Occupational Therapy and MSc Occupational Therapy (Pre-Registration)<strong> </strong>courses. A variety of practice skills are taught both in generic clinical skills rooms and in our own Occupational Performance Room. We also utilise QMU's clinical simulation suite which is equipped to practice both hands-on skills and communication in a simulated real-life (hospital based) environment. In addition to these spaces, our students have access to art/craft based practical rooms as well as kitchens and the outdoor spaces around campus (eg the QMU allotment) when engaging in a variety of occupations.  </p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>You will have the opportunity (subject to availability) to undertake practice-based learning at an overseas university with which we have partnership agreements. Please visit the <a href=\"/study-here/international-students/exchanges-and-study-abroad/\">Exchanges and Study Abroad</a> pages for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

<p>QMU offers two undergraduate pathways of study in occupational therapy to achieve a recognised qualification. Initially all students register on the undergraduate master’s pathway and study together, then, from the end of the second year, students on the BSc (Hons) pathway follow a slightly different programme of study to those studying for the undergraduate master’s degree. On graduation, both pathways offer eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as an occupational therapist.</p>
<p>Please see the course structure on this page for more information on the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/">benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>]]></Value>
