      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">Could you be one of our next Governing Body members?</span></p>
<p>GIVE is a route to board membership for QMU alumni.</p>
<p>If you are a graduate of QMU, think you might have something to offer the University’s governing body, but currently lack the board experience or confidence you need to join it, the GIVE scheme could be for you.</p>
<p>GIVE offers alumni without board experience formal training and mentoring, along with the opportunity to witness the work of our governing body (the University Court) in action. It is designed to provide a pathway into full membership of the Court, and to support your professional and personal development.</p>
<p>Membership of any board can provide you with a powerful route to having your voice heard, and to giving back to society.  GIVE will not only provide a pathway to membership of QMU’s Court, but also prepare you for board membership more generally, helping enable our diverse alumni community to contribute across civic society.</p>
<p><strong>We are currently accepting applications from people interested in participating in the scheme in the 2024/2025 academic year (closing date is 1 July 2024).</strong></p>]]></Value>
