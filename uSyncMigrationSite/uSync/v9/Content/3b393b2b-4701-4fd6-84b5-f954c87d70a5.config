<p>The REF 2021 Code of Practice will ensure that our procedures and processes for REF 2021 do not discriminate unlawfully against, or otherwise have the effect of harassing or victimising individuals because of age, disability, faith/belief, gender identity, marriage/civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, sex and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>In developing and implementing its REF 2021 Code of Practice, the University is committed to the principles behind the key policy decisions underpinning the requirement that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) submit all staff with SRR. The University acknowledges that this change has been introduced in response to concerns that selecting staff in previous assessment exercises had potentially deleterious effects on individuals, their career choices, progression and morale.</p>
<p>The REF 2021 Code of Practice is consistent with the HR Excellence in Research Award, which was awarded to the University by the European Commission in 2011 and retained after an 8 year peer review in 2019. Fixed-term and part-time staff will not be treated any less favorably than comparable employees on open contracts or working full-time.</p>
<p>Central to our submission to REF 2021 will be an institutional-level environment statement, providing evidence about how equality and diversity in research careers is supported and promoted across the institution.</p>

<p>For the purposes of REF 2021 research is defined as a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared. It <strong>includes</strong> work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, culture, society, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction. It <strong>excludes</strong> routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research. It <strong>includes</strong> research that is published, disseminated or made publicly available in the form of assessable research outputs, and confidential reports.</p>

The EDC is responsible to the University Court for the development of the strategic framework for equality in service provision and in employment across the University. The Committee is a Standing Committee of the Court, to which it reports at each meeting on its discussions, on the development of specific initiatives, and to which it presents policies and procedures for approval. In so doing, it has a function that reflects the general duties.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The EDC has a remit to eliminate discrimination, advance equal opportunities and foster good relations by tackling prejudice and promoting understanding, thereby ensuring the University avoids the potential for discrimination on grounds of the protected equality strands.</p>\n<p>The Committee’s remit goes beyond legislative compliance. It aims to support delivery of key elements of the University’s Strategic Plan through policy development and the promotion of examples of good practice from both internal and external sources. It also seeks to develop and maintain effective networking and liaison in equality and diversity issues. This applies internally within the University and externally, with a particular focus on working relationships with professional equality experts and equality bodies such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission and Advance HE (formerly the Equality Challenge Unit).</p>\n<p>Along with its responsibility to develop and agree the institutional mission, the University Court has a role in ‘establishing a vision for equality, and in moving the agenda beyond compliance to an approach that ensures the richness and diversity of society are reflected and celebrated within the institution’.</p>\n<p>We consider that we have made significant progress over the last 5 years in particular in terms of the University Court’s approach to its equality duties, evidenced through policy development and through systematic review of the diversity of its membership. Progress in terms of the latter is described below.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>We have moved to collecting equality data in relation to Court members in support of our commitment to ensuring that there is an appropriate balance of independent members on the University Court in terms of equality and diversity. The data assists the Court in meeting its equality and diversity goals by identifying where gaps in representation arise, allowing the Court to target recruitment activity to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved.</p>\n<p>Recruitment for independent or lay members during 2015-17 continued to address directly the diversity of membership in line with the commitment set out in our Mainstreaming Report and Outcomes that ‘all committees and decision making bodies of the University are representative of its community’. A diversity audit of current membership was conducted by the Nominations Committee so that recruitment took account fully of the balance of skills, attributes and experience of the current lay membership.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>With advice from Advance HE, we have particularly sought expressions of interest from women, disabled people, ethnic minorities and applicants who would further enhance the diversity of the Court. Advertisements for vacancies are placed in a range of media, including, Women on Boards (WOB), with the intention of encouraging more female applicants. WOBs exists to provide information, encouragement and connections to help women get to the top within their own company or to take on a board or committee role as a non executive director (NED), trustee or governor. Again with the advice of Advance HE, the person specification was revised so as to accommodate those without previous board level experience, but who were able to demonstrate a track record of success in professional areas of expertise.</p>\n<p>At its meeting in December 2014, the University Court approved goals and policies in regard to the balance of its independent members in terms of equality and diversity as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>‘Queen Margaret University is committed to ensuring that the University Court (Court), Senate and all committees and decision making bodies of the University are representative of its community.

Retention of the award after eight years is a significant achievement and we have welcomed the timely production of the UKRI Review of the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers (June 2018). We have embraced some of the helpful key themes presented in this Review, relating to Researcher Independence, Freedom to Innovate and Equality and Diversity in the delivery of our Concordat Action Plan 2018-2020. In March 2019 we received confirmation that we had been successful in our eight year retention of the award.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Our Welcome to Research@QMU staff booklet, which sets out our commitment to equality and diversity in research, is available on the website, in hard copy at key points across the campus and is sent to all new members of staff by HR. In 2015, as part of our post REF 2014 strategy, we invested in a new institutional structure of strategic Research Centres to help drive equality and diversity at disciplinary level. Specific initiatives around mentoring and peer to peer buddying for female researchers were introduced. Through the annual review of Research Centres, taking place every November, the University monitors progress in addressing and responding to equality and diversity issues and KPIs have been set.</p>\n<p>Since REF 2014, we have sought to establish mechanisms to fully capture the positive impact of our research on the economy, health, society, culture, and public discourse.

Specifically we have been championing Female Entrepreneurship, building on the success of our 2019 EntreprenHER event with our Chancellor Prue Leith.
