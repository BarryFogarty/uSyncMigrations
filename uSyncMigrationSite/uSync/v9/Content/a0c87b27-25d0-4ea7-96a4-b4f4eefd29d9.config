      <Value><![CDATA[<p>A question I’ve been asked a lot, and continue to ask myself, is “why are you studying Gastronomy?” I graduated in 2002 with a degree in Food Product Development, and worked for quite a few of Scotland’s best food companies. I’ve helped bring hundreds of products to the marketplace including Disney Birthday Cakes, Guinness Sausages, Suki Tea and Raw Cakes. Most recently I ran my own business for two years, Clyde Valley Tomatoes, growing and selling Scottish tomatoes at Farmers Markets, Morrison’s and Waitrose supermarkets. So, I should know everything I need to know about running and advising a food company? No, No, No. You can never stop learning.</p>
<p>What I began to realise over the past year was that my experience, although wide, was focused on one area – feeding a consumer society. I’m very comfortable designing products that consumers want to buy, and companies want to make. Whether I will attain that elusive feeling of self-actualisation doing that for the next 25 years is a different question. I was introduced to the concept of ‘the rocking chair test’ a few years ago – will what you are doing now pass ‘the rocking chair test’ when you are old? Will you look back and say ‘yes, that was a good thing to do’.</p>
<p>I chose to study Gastronomy because it encourages us to step back and re-evaluate the food system we know today. Gastronomy covers everything from soil science to anthropology, taking a much more holistic approach to the world of food. It’s an approach that wasn’t really considered when I chose to study ‘food’ back in the 90s. The approach then was much more about food as a commodity, and funnily enough, that’s how many of us view food today.</p>
<p>I’m only in week three of study, but already I can feel myself questioning things much more. I’ve reverted to that five year old child I was who continually said “but why?” The difference now is that I’m asking those questions to myself, using the tools around me to start to answer those questions.</p>
<p>The next year is going to be transformational, and I look forward to sharing my journey as it happens.</p>
