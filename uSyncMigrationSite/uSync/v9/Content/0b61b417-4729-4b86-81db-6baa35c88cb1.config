      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Scooping the Student Experience award, QMU was delighted to be recognised as a flourishing place and space for all learners, beating off stiff competition from Lancashire Teaching Hospitals Trust, Liverpool John Moores University, University Hospitals of Derby and Burton FT, University of Hertfordshire, and University of the West of Scotland.</p>
<p>QMU’s nursing team travelled to London’s Grosvenor House on Friday 26 April for the glittering ceremony, at which the institution was represented across five awards categories. QMU student Stephanie Norton-Alexander was a nominee in the Student Nurse of the Year (adult) category, and Karen Rennie, a QMU PhD student and research assistant, was nominated for Learner of the Year (Post-registration).</p>
<p>The University’s partnership with <a href="https://cyrenians.scot">Cyrenians </a>(the Scotland-wide charity working with homeless and vulnerable people) was also nominated for The Partnership of the Year award. QMU’s final nomination was in the category of Nurse Education Provider of the Year (Pre-registration).</p>
<p>Steve Ford, Nursing Times editor and host of the Student Nursing Times Awards, said: “The 2019 Student Nursing Times Awards has been a record-breaking year. With over 173 shortlisted candidates which were whittled down from over 600 entries, the most we have ever received! It’s safe to say, just being shortlisted is a real achievement and you should all be incredibly proud of yourselves.”</p>
<p>Professor Jan Dewing, Director of The Centre for Person-centred Practice Research at QMU and the Sue Pembrey Chair in Nursing, said: “I’m absolutely delighted and so proud of QMU’s nursing team for winning the Student Experience Award at this year’s Student Nursing Times Awards.</p>
<p>“This well-deserved accolade serves as further evidence of the University’s sterling reputation in nursing, and is just one of the multiple benefits we can see from investing in the co-creation of a person-centred culture in the team.”</p>]]></Value>
