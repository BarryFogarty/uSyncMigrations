<p><strong>Categories of collaboration </strong></p>
<p>There are various categories of collaborative arrangement and terminology varies. Within QMU, the definitions below are used. These definitions take into account QAA guidance on <a href="http://www.qaa.ac.uk/quality-code/the-existing-uk-quality-code/part-a-setting-and-maintaining-academic-standards" title="QAA Website">Qualifications involving more than one awarding body</a> (October 2015).</p>
<p>Each collaborative arrangement is unique and not every partnership falls neatly into these categories. Variation is perfectly allowable within QMU’s regulations. The key points to remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The requirements of any local government or regulatory bodies must be met. (Eg, in Singapore, programmes and their management arrangements must meet the requirements of the Council for Private Education.)</li>
<li>Programme management arrangements must be proportionate to the likely level of risk to quality and standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of collaboration (full programmes):</p>
<ol>
<li>Franchise The partner institution delivers a copy of an existing QMU degree. Some slight variation may be allowed to fit the local context, but only in respect of elective modules, not the core content. Students will undertake the same assessments as those in the QMU delivered modules. If the parent programme changes, the franchised programme must change too. The degree is awarded by QMU alone as the partner doesn’t have its own degree-awarding powers.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Validation. A degree is developed to suit the needs of the partner institution. It may be based on QMU modules or entirely made up of new modules. QMU may or may not offer the same award internally (but must have the academic expertise to support it). Assessments are set by the partner institution with advice from QMU (and the external examiner). The degree is awarded by QMU alone as the partner doesn’t have its own degree-awarding powers.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Joint award. A degree is developed jointly by QMU and a partner with its own degree-awarding powers. Normally, teaching will be shared between the two institutions. A single certificate is awarded with the names of both partners on it.
<p>For partnerships that involve three or more partners with degree awarding powers, agreement will be reached as to which partner issues the certificate and how the contribution of the other partners is acknowledged in either the certificate or the transcript.</p>
</li>
<li>Double / multiple award. This is the same as a joint award but covers situations where one of the partners is unable constitutionally to award a joint degree. Instead each institution grants the degree but there is a note on the certificate or transcript explaining the nature of the relationship with the other partner’s award. Erasmus degrees may take this form. Some 'concurrent' arrangements may also be classed as double degree (see below).<br /><br /></li>
<li>Dual award. These are hybrid awards involving elements of each institution’s degree. They may be developed by two institutions agreeing to accept credit from the other partner’s modules towards their own award. Typically students will spend periods of study at each partner institution. They must meet the requirements of each separate award (although usually this will be done partly by credit transfer). Each partner is responsible for its own award and each certificate is awarded separately. The benefit of the arrangement is that students should be able to achieve both awards in less time than if they had studied each separately. This type of arrangement may be appropriate, for instance, where one partner offers a one-year Masters and the other offers a two-year programme.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Concurrent award. This is a variant of a franchised or validated programme that occurs when the partner institution has its own degree-awarding powers but wishes also to offer validation by a UK university in order to give the qualification greater international recognition. Students undertake the UK university’s curriculum and satisfy all the requirements for the UK degree. The partner institution also awards a degree. Certificates / transcripts must make clear the nature of the relationship. Degrees of this nature might be offered as what is sometimes referred to as a ‘twinning’ arrangement. This refers to arrangements whereby the overseas partner delivers and quality assures the early years of the programme itself. The UK university agrees to grant RPL and accepts students direct into the later years of the programme, which are designed and quality assured by the UK partner. Graduates receive awards from both partners.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other types of collaboration:</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Short programme<br /><br />Collaborative partners may be approved to deliver individual modules or a small number of modules that do not lead to a formal award.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Credit rating<br /><br />An external organisation delivers a module or programme and QMU’s only role is to confirm the equivalent credit value and level of the programme. The University does not award credit, and takes no role in assessment.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Articulation<br /><br />QMU grants credit to applicants from a partner's programme and allows them to enter a related QMU programme with advanced standing.</li>
