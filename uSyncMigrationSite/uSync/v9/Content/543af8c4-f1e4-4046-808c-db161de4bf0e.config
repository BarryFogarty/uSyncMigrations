    "content": "<p>A deferral is applicable where a student discontinues study with the University for an extended period of time (i.e. into the next academic year). It can be applied for and approved on the basis of valid medical or personal reasons at the request of the student. Short breaks for medical or personal reasons, which affect a student’s ability to undertake assessments on time or their performance in assessment, should be applied for under <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/manage-your-studies/extenuating-circumstances/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"extenuating circumstances\">Extenuating Circumstances</a>.</p>\n<p>A deferral of studies will normally be granted for a maximum of 12 months. Extensions to this will only be granted in exceptional circumstances and students must reapply. The application form for a deferral of studies is available at the bottom of this webpage <a href=\"/current-students/thinking-of-leaving/taking-a-break-or-returning-to-study/\">Taking a Break or Returning to Study | Thinking of Leaving| Queen Margaret University (qmu.ac.uk)</a></p>\n<p>Students should be aware that a deferral of studies is not an automatic right and therefore applications may be refused if a deferral is deemed inappropriate or if insufficient supporting evidence is provided. Requests for deferrals must be approved by the Programme Leader.</p>\n<p><strong>1.1. Associate degree students studying with an external partner</strong><br />Students studying with one of QMU’s local college partners are subject to the University <br />Deferral Procedure. Students considering deferral should discuss this with both their College Tutor and the Thinking of Leaving staff (<a href=\"mailto:thinkingofleaving@qmu.ac.uk\">thinkingofleaving@qmu.ac.uk</a>) at the University. The final decision regarding the deferral application rests with the University.</p>"

    "title": "2. Criteria for a deferral of studies",
    "content": "<p>The criteria for a deferral are circumstances beyond a student’s control which may affect their ability to continue on their programme of study. These are normally of a medical or personal nature affecting the student for an extended period of time i.e. a significant proportion of the current academic session. This would include circumstances preventing attendance on an ongoing basis. Examples would include, but not be limited to, illness, pregnancy, maternity or paternity leave, accident, bereavement or a significant change to the student’s employment. The University also recognises that some students need time away from their studies for other reasons such as prolonged homesickness or uncertainty about course choice. In these cases, students may be permitted to defer if they can demonstrate that time away from their studies would help to facilitate successful completion of the programme on their return.</p>\n<p>Deferral of studies should not be used when a student has been unable to submit course work, take an exam or performed less well in an assessment than they may have expected to. In those circumstances students should refer to <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/manage-your-studies/extenuating-circumstances/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"extenuating circumstances\">Extenuating Circumstances</a> guidance and the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/academic-appeals-regulations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"academic appeals\">Academic Appeals Regulations</a> to find out if they are eligible to be considered under these routes.</p>\n<p>Other examples where a deferral request will NOT normally be approved are when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the student has previously been granted a period of deferral</li>\n<li>the request is submitted retrospectively i.e. the student applies for the deferral significantly after the planned start date of the deferral period</li>\n<li>the deferral period would take the student outwith their registration period either with the <br />University or the relevant Professional Body (see Registration period for programme and with professional bodies below)</li>\n<li>planned changes to the student’s programme would make it impossible for the student to <br />complete their original programme</li>\n<li>academic progress is unsatisfactory</li>\n<li>the student has failed to make appropriate supporting evidence available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.1.</strong> <strong>Medical grounds<br /></strong>Students must make relevant supporting evidence available to their Programme Leader. This can be in the form of a medical certificate, letter from Student Services (or equivalent department at non-Scottish campuses) or other relevant qualified practitioner. Where appropriate, re-admittance on to a programme of study may be subject to confirmation by an appropriate medical practitioner indicating the student’s fitness to return to studies.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2. Personal reasons</strong> <br />Students should make documentary evidence available to their Programme Leader to support their claim. Individual circumstances will determine the type of evidence. Students should seek to provide supporting information from an independent person, organisation or support service that could confirm the student’s circumstances.</p>\n<p><br />If a student’s reasons for deferral are of a personal nature that they do not want to document in <br />detail, then the student can instead discuss these with their Personal Academic Tutor, the Student Counsellor, or the Students’ Union Welfare and Representation Coordinator. These staff may then be able to provide a letter or email confirming that the student has valid reasons, without disclosing details, to the Programme Leader, ensuring they can consider the claim. Please note that this is not an automatic entitlement and is at the discretion of the staff involved.</p>"

This can be helpful as a way of keeping in contact with the programme and the University. Students are encouraged to consider what might be appropriate for them and discuss this with their Programme Leader before starting their deferral period. Module Coordinators can offer advice about recommended reading and other work, in the lead <br />up to a student returning to studies.</p>\n<p>Students who have been granted a deferral will not normally be permitted to sit any assessments nor will they be permitted to take part in any project/dissertation work during the period of deferral. A student may exceptionally be permitted to re-sit an assessment which cannot be carried forward to the next stage of study where this impacts on the student progressing to the next stage. Any exceptions will need to be confirmed by the student's Programme Leader.</p>\n<p>Students who live in University accommodation should contact Accommodation Services to discuss their situation. Students who defer will remain liable for rent for the duration of their tenancy agreement.</p>"

This varies depending on the type of programme, the level and the mode of study (i.e. full-time or part-time). Deferrals count towards this time period. It is therefore very important that students considering a deferral are aware of this and ensure they can return to and complete the programme within the registration period. Further guidance is available in the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/registration-regulations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"registration regulations\">Registration Regulations</a>.</p>\n<p>Students on Health Science programmes which require registration with a Professional Body such as the Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council (NMC) or the Health &amp; Care Professions Council (HCPC) also need to consider the registration period of the Professional Body. This may be shorter than the University registration period and if this is the case the Professional Body time period would apply. Students should be aware that in some cases there are no grounds for appeal relating to registration periods with Professional Bodies.</p>"

For example, if a student defers their studies 28 days after the start of semester, they will be liable for the fees for the remainder of that semester. Semester one fees are equivalent to half a full year fee.</p>\n<p>If a student or a sponsor has paid the fees for a full academic session and the student then defers, the tuition fee will normally be retained by the University and carried forward to the next academic session.</p>\n<p>Sponsored students should discuss their deferral with their sponsor.
