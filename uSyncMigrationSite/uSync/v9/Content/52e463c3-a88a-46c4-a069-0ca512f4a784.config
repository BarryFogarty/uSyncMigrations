      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The new programme provides an outstanding opportunity to combine paid employment with a Business Management degree, meaning that students have the benefit of graduate level education without accruing the normal debt associated with university study.</p>
<p>As part of Skills Development Scotland expanding provision of graduate apprenticeships, QMU’s <a href="/business-GA">Graduate Apprenticeship Programme</a> now has the green light to offer 20 places to people who have a business-related role within an organisation. Aligned with QMU’s existing support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many of the participating organisations will mainly be SMEs that are keen to nurture and support the development of new and existing employees.</p>
<p>There is no upper age limit associated with the QMU programme, so any person living in Scotland, and working in a business-related role within a Scottish based organisation, is eligible.</p>
<p>Skills Development Scotland, Director of Service Design and Innovation, Jonathan Clark, said: “Graduate Apprenticeships have made learning more accessible, giving employees the opportunity to develop their skills and get qualified whilst still at work. From this year, there are more opportunities across Scotland to take up a Graduate Apprenticeship and a wider choice of qualifications on offer.  The launch of Graduate Apprenticeships at Queen Margaret University shows that they work for businesses and individuals and meet the needs of the local economy.  Work-based learning enables employers to develop and retain their workforce and Skills Development Scotland will continue to shape the offer in partnership with industry to provide relevant opportunities that respond to demand.”</p>
<p>Susanne Ross, Programme Leader for BA (Hons) Business Management at QMU, added: “Apprentices will be able to develop their academic knowledge and critical thinking whilst strengthening their business skills in the workplace. The work they undertake with their employer will count towards their Business degree. It’s a great opportunity to combine practical and academic learning with the experience of working in a real business environment. It will also allow students to apply their new-found knowledge to projects within their organisations. It’s a win-win for both the apprentice and the employer.”</p>
<p>Alice Thompson, Co-Founder and Director of Social Bite, said: “This programme is a fantastic opportunity for staff to get a business management degree and apply their new knowledge, first hand, in the workplace.”  </p>
<p>The QMU <a href="/business-GA">Graduate Apprenticeship programme</a> will run over four years with successful students graduating with a BA (Hons) Business Management. The programme will be a combination of blended learning with projects taking place within the workplace, online learning and day release, which allows students to benefit from face-to-face teaching with academics and also the benefits of being part of the on-campus community.</p>
<p>The QMU academic team is currently working with employers in Edinburgh and the Lothians to establish learning partnerships. QMU will be running the Graduate Apprenticeship Programme in Business Management from September 2018.</p>
<p>For information on the QMU programme and on how to apply, contact the Programme Leader, Dr Andrew Bratton, E: <a href="mailto:abratton@qmu.ac.uk">abratton@qmu.ac.uk </a>or T: 131 474 0000. Find out more about <a href="/business-GA">Graduate Apprenticeships</a> at QMU.</p>]]></Value>
