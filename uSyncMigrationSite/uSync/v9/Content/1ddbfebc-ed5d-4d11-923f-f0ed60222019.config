Not only does an exchange program allow you stretch your wings, it will bring you benefits for years to come. Employers are impressed with students who take on the challenge, and a higher level of cultural awareness is considered an important factor when hiring employees, particularly for a global role. You may also learn another language, which is always a good addition to a CV.
