<p><span class="lead">1.0 - Aims and Objectives</span></p>
<p>The aim of this policy is to provide Managers and Staff with guidance on partner leave (formerly known as paternity leave) and pay arrangements to ensure that this is undertaken fairly and consistently across Queen Margaret University (QMU) in accordance with equality and diversity principles.</p>
<p> <br /><span class="lead">2.0 - Scope of Policy</span></p>
<p>This policy applies to all employees taking partner leave within Queen Margaret University. </p>
<p>Throughout the policy, individuals are sometimes referred to as the “mother” or “father” or “he” or “she”.  This is not intended to prohibit application of the policy to all eligible employees and all possible arrangements but is simply to ease and assist in reading the policy<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><span class="lead">3.0 - Monitor and Review</span></p>
<p>Human Resources are responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of this policy and supporting procedures and will conduct reviews at appropriate intervals. </p>
<p>Anyone who feels they have been unfairly treated or discriminated against should contact Human Resources. </p>
<p><span class="lead">4.0 - Equal Opportunities</span></p>
<p>QMU is committed to equality of opportunity for all its staff and the terms of this policy and its supporting procedures and guidance notes are designed to ensure the fair and transparent treatment for all staff irrespective of age, race, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, sexual orientation, religion or belief, sex or contractual status.  A review of the Equality Impact Assessment is undertaken on this policy each time they are reviewed and updated</p>
<p><span class="lead">5.0 - Responsibility for this Policy</span></p>
<p>Human Resources. <br /><br />Any changes to this policy and supporting procedures will be made in consultation with appropriate bodies. <br /><br />QMU reserves the right to update HR Policies in line with new or updated Employment Legislation.</p>
<p><span class="lead">6.0 Eligibility for Ordinary Paternity Leave</span> <br /><br />Employees of QMU are entitled to the University’s Partner Pay from day one of their employment with the University, as long as they meet the following eligibility criteria, the employee must be either:</p>
<p>the biological father of the child</p>
<p>the husband, partner or civil partner of the mother of the child</p>
<p>the partner of the primary adopter</p>
<p>have responsibility for the child’s upbringing. </p>
<p>In the case of couples who are adopting a child or having a child through a surrogacy arrangement, adoption leave and pay are available to only one partner. The other partner can take Partner Leave.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>7.0 Entitlements</strong></span></p>
<p><br />Eligible employees are entitled to take one to four consecutive week’s leave.  Partner leave must be taken as a continuous block and cannot be taken as separate weeks or odd days<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Employees can choose to commence their Partner Leave on any day of the week either on the date of the child’s birth/placement (whether this is earlier or later than expected) or a chosen day thereafter.</p>
<p>Partner leave must be completed within 56 days of the actual date of birth/placement of the child or, where the child is born earlier than expected, between the birth and 56 days from the expected due date.  </p>
<p>Only one period of leave is available to employees irrespective of whether more than one child is born as the result of the same pregnancy/adoption.</p>
<p><span class="lead">8.0 Paternity Pay</span><br /><br /></p>
<p>Partner Pay is paid at the employee full pay for a maximum of 4 weeks. (This will include an element of Statutory Paternity Pay where appropriate which is effectively enhanced by the University to equal full pay).</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead"><strong>9.0 Notice of Intention to Take Paternity Leave</strong></span></p>
<p>The employee must inform their line manager and HR of their intention to take Partner Leave by the end of the qualifying week (15<sup>th</sup> week before the baby is expected to be born). Or in cases of adoption, within 7 days of being matched with a child.</p>
<p>The employee should give an indication of:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the baby is due to be born/placed,</li>
<li>whether the employee wishes to take leave,</li>
<li>when the partner leave is expected to start.</li>
</ul>
<p>The employee must complete the Partner Leave form.  The employee must submit the form to HR once it has been signed by the employee’s line manager. </p>
<p>The employee should provide a copy of the mother’s MatB1 form along with the Partner Leave form.  </p>
<p>The employee can change the start date of the Partner Leave by providing as much notice as reasonably practicable to their line manager.  </p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the employee to confirm to HR any changes to Partner Leave dates.</p>
<p><span class="lead">10.0 Time off for Antenatal Care</span></p>
<p>Employees are entitled to take reasonable paid time off work to attend antenatal appointments.  When requested evidence of appointments must be provided to the line manager. </p>
<p><span class="lead">11.0 Miscarriage and Stillbirths</span></p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that the baby is stillborn (after 24 weeks of pregnancy), all the provisions outlined in this policy will apply in the same way as with a live birth. Within the Special Leave policy there is also an entitlement to Parental Bereavement leave.</p>
<p><strong>12.0 Baby Loss Leave </strong></p>
<p>If an employee experiences a miscarriage prior to the start of the 25<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy, the University offers support of three days paid leave to partners.  Any further subsequent absence from work in this instance would be arranged under the Sickness Absence Policy, Bereavement Leave or Annual Leave. </p>
<p>Please note in these circumstances, employees will not be entitled to Partner Leave or Pay</p>
<p><strong>13.0 Contractual Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Normal employment terms and conditions continue throughout the period of partner leave.</p>
<p><strong>14.0 Payment of Pension Contributions</strong></p>
<p>Employees and QMU will continue to contribute to the employee’s pension scheme while on Partner Leave.  </p>
<p><strong>15.0 Childcare Vouchers</strong></p>
<p>The Childcare Voucher scheme is now closed to new entrants and has been replaced by the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit">child tax credit scheme</a>.</p>
<p>Some employees who intend to take Partner Leave may already be enrolled in the QMU childcare vouchers scheme because they are already paying for childcare for existing children.  If such an employee wishes to continue paying into the childcare vouchers scheme while they are on Partner Leave then Payroll will continue to deduct the payments from their Partner Pay</p>
