      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">What happens once I have received an offer?</span></p>
<p>If you receive an unconditional or conditional offer, you may be invited to one of our Offer Holder Days. An Offer Holder Day is a course-specific event which is designed to provide you with more information about your chosen course, the student experience at QMU and give you a chance to visit our campus. You also have the opportunity to meet academic staff and chat with current students.</p>
<p>Next, you must make a decision on your offers. Once you have received all of your decisions, you will have to reply to your offers by a specific deadline given in UCAS Track. If you decide to accept our offer, you will need to do this on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/after-you-apply/track-your-ucas-application" target="_blank" title="UCAS Track">UCAS Track</a>.</p>
<p>When making a decision on an offer, you have three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a firm choice – this is your first choice of course.</li>
<li>If your firm choice is conditional, you can also select an insurance choice – this is your back-up choice in case you don’t meet the conditions for your firm choice. We recommend that your insurance choice has lower conditions than your firm choice to give you the best chance of securing a place.</li>
<li>Decline any other offers.</li>

You can apply for accommodation if you are holding a conditional or unconditional offer. There is no deadline for submitting your application however, we recommend you apply as early as possible to avoid any disappointment. To virtually explore our accommodation, find out whether living on campus is right for you or to apply, <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/9fa80e4258ea485184e40d82eabd6612}\" title=\"Accommodation\">click here.</a></p>\n<p>Our Accommodation Team and our Student Union also provide support and advice for applicants who are considering accommodation off-campus.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Arrange funding for your studies</strong></span></p>\n<p>You may be eligible to apply for student grant or student loan to support the cost of your studies and living costs. We advise offer holders to apply to their relevant student funding body as early as possible to ensure funding is in place for the beginning of your programme. You can find out which student finance agency you could be eligible to apply to on our dedicated <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/84e109c45fe74b5c86fa1bb04f5fa7a5}\" title=\"Undergraduate Funding\">undergraduate funding</a> pages.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Send copies of your qualification certificates</strong></span></p>\n<p>To verify that the qualifications stated on your application form were accurate, please send copies of your previous qualifications to us. Your certificates must be <strong>final</strong> and <strong>official</strong> versions, where the information can be checked and verified. For example, we can accept an SQA summary of attainment but not a printed version of online results from your school or college. To upload your documents, use the link provided in your offer letter or alternatively, scan and email copies of these to <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:admissiona@qmu.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Send your documents to Admissions\">Admissions</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of our courses have detailed requirements, so you will need to send more than you might expect. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GCSE Certificates (for example to show Maths and English results)</li>\n<li>SQA transcripts (summary of attainment) for example to show Maths and English Nat5 results or to show the Graded Unit result from your HNC or HND.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your qualification certificate is not in English please include the original language version as well as an official translation, stamped and signed by an accredited translator.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Double check your conditions</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you are required to meet conditions (anyone with a conditional offer), please take note of the following in case this applies to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>English language: If you require a student visa, we recommend that you take a <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prove-your-english-language-abilities-with-a-secure-english-language-test-selt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Government Website - English Language Test\">Secure English Language Test</a> as recognised by the UK government. This includes \"SELT\" IELTS tests. We can also accept other qualifications and some further advice can be found <a href=\"/study-here/international-students/english-language-requirements/\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>SQA Higher qualifications: We are able to accept Highers and Advanced Highers taken over two or more years. Please note that only Higher passes at Grade C or above should be included and if an Advanced Higher is achieved, the preceding Higher in that subject will not be counted in the UCAS tariff points. Grade C or above at SQA Advanced Higher is considered equivalent to grade A at Higher. Highers are not counted If you have the Advanced Higher in the same subject. We are able to accept Highers and Advanced Highers taken over two or more years. If you are re-sitting a subject, only your best result will be counted towards the points total.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some courses that have placements require a Criminal Record Check. You can find more information in your offer letter and about the process <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/dabd02f8d6814e14b243dcb9b7ca3272}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Additional Information for Courses with Required Placements\">here.</a></p>"
