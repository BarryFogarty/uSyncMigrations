    "content": "<p>The creation of art in the presence of a trained art psychotherapist can have a profoundly positive effect for people experiencing difficulties in their lives. Art therapy is not a recreational activity (although the sessions can be enjoyable) but a form of psychotherapy that helps people address confusing and distressing issues.</p>\n<p>Art psychotherapists work with people to access their own image-making abilities. You could work with people of any age, from very small children tthrough to older adults, helping them to use art media to express themselves and communicate. You may work with groups or individuals.</p>\n<p>You and the person you are working with will jointly explore the meaning of the process and image/art object in the light of personal experiences and/or interpersonal relationships that may sometimes be distressing or troubling. The aim is to facilitate the intra-personal and interpersonal communication of experiences that may be difficult to put into words. The art psychotherapist’s task is to support processes of emotional integration by providing a safe, reliable and containing therapeutic environment within which the person can create and use art making to develop insight and promote change.</p>\n<p>This course will introduce you to the profession, theory and practice of art psychotherapy. Regular practice placements providing art psychotherapy sessions will build on your theoretical learning and allow you to apply your developing skills.</p>\n<p>Your learning will be enriched by the interdisciplinary structure of the course as you study alongside your peers from various other pathways within QMU’s Person-Centred Practice Framework, including the MSc Music Therapy and MSc Dramatherapy.</p>\n<p>All students are required to be in personal psychodynamic therapy throughout the duration of the course.</p>\n<p>Students will attend supervision on site at the practice placement setting and at QMU throughout the training.</p>"

Queen Margaret University does accept students with degrees or professional qualifications in other subjects relevant to Art Psychotherapy (for example: psychology, art history, nursing, occupational therapy, social work, sociology, medicine) as long as the applicant can also demonstrate an active art-making practice and has relevant work experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What should a portfolio include?</strong></p>\n<p>A portfolio should demonstrate a serious involvement with art media and your personal process of work with imagery. We want to see evidence that you have a committed art-making practice and are comfortable using a range of art materials. We do not teach technical skills related to the use of different art media on the course and it is important that you come to the course with confidence in this area.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there other steps I can take to prepare to apply for the MSc Art Psychotherapy?</strong></p>\n<p>Reading about art psychotherapy is essential and a pre-course reading list is provided at the end of this document. Introductory art therapy courses and workshops are also a helpful way of learning about the subject. QMU runs an introductory course in art psychotherapy each year and this is a good way of building your knowledge and determining whether this is the right career path for you.</p>\n<p>See websites; <a href=\"https://www.baat.org/\"><strong>British Association of Art Therapists</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.hcpc-uk.org/\"><strong>Health &amp; Care Professions Council.</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Does QM have Open Days?</strong></p>\n<p>QMU holds university postgraduate open evenings, usually one in the autumn and one in the spring. This offers potential applicants an opportunity to meet with representatives of the art psychotherapy programme and discuss any queries with them. The university also offers virtual meetings on those days. Please check <a href=\"/open-days-and-meeting-us/undergraduate-open-days/\"><strong>the university website for details of the postgraduate open evenings</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the course structured?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Full Time</strong></p>\n<p>Year One 9.00am-5.00pm on Mondays and Tuesdays, 2 days per week on placement plus 2 online modules</p>\n<p>Year Two 9.00am-5.00pm on Thursdays only and 2 days per week on placement</p>\n<p><strong>Part Time</strong></p>\n<p>Year One 9.00am-5.00pm on Tuesday, 1 day per week on placement and an online module</p>\n<p>Year Two 9.00am-5.00pm on Monday, 1 day per week on placement and an online module</p>\n<p>Year three 9.00am-5.00pm on Thursday and 1 day per week on placement</p>\n<p>Year 4 Part-time students wishing to complete their Clinical Project in Year Four will attend personal academic tutorials by appointment.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Part-time students will need to attend an intense introduction to placement at the start of year 1. They will need to be available 4 days a week, Monday-Thursday for the first 6 weeks of study.</p>\n<p>You will also be required to carry out independent learning. The Art Studio will be open for practice during evenings and weekends, and outside of normal teaching hours.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the practice placement allocated?</strong></p>\n<p>Practice Placements are arranged and allocated by the Practice Placement Coordinator and Administrator in the School Office. Students have two practice placements during the training course – one working with adults and one working with children or young people. The Practice Placement Coordinator will match the student's learning needs with a suitable practice placement. Efforts are made to arrange practice placements in or near the city where the student resides though some travel may be necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>What kinds of practice placements are offered?</strong></p>\n<p>The range of practice placements are extensive including placements within hospitals, schools, voluntary sector organisations, child and family centres, counselling services, prisons, drug and alcohol services, hospices, community based health centres, community based mental health teams, day centres for the elderly and for adults with physical and/or learning disabilities. The range of practice placements for art psychotherapy students changes from year to year.</p>\n<p><strong>What else do I need to know about placements?</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to complete 2 years of practice placement. Participation in a weekly supervision seminar in university is a co-requisite of the practice placement. Students will be required to complete a police check / Disclosure Scotland (PVG) for their placement. International students are required to bring police checks with them for the start of the semester at the latest. Admissions may ask for this information to arrive 3 months prior to the start of the course so that a final offer of a place can be granted.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are students required to attend personal psychotherapy for the duration of the MSc Art Psychotherapy?</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to attend weekly personal psychodynamic psychotherapy for the duration of the MSc Art Psychotherapy course. All of the registered art psychotherapy courses in the UK have this personal psychotherapy requirement. Responsibility for finding a therapist rests with the student. In general, students are advised to work with a therapist whose orientation is compatible with the psychodynamic orientation of the programme, with a minimum of 5 years experience BAAT, UKCP or BACP or HCPC State Registered.</p>\n<p>Fees for personal therapy range on average from £35-60 per session. It is important to bear this additional expense in mind and budget for it.</p>\n<p>Personal psychodynamic psychotherapy is seen to be supportive of the student whilst on the course and also enables a student to have personal experience of a therapeutic relationship. As personal therapy is a programme requirement, the student's therapist will be requested to submit a letter to the student’s personal academic tutor at the end of each semester informing her of the number of sessions the student has attended. Otherwise, the student's personal therapy is distinct from the course and is confidential between student and therapist. Personal psychotherapy is predominately carried out while seeing clients during semesters – on a weekly basis – while additional sessions may be carried out over the summer.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the course fees?</strong></p>\n<p>A full outline of the MSc Art Psychotherapy course fees and updated <a href=\"/study-here/postgraduate-study/2022/msc-art-psychotherapy/\"><strong>information on possible student funding can be found on the MSc Art Psychotherapy course pages</strong></a>. There are no grants and most students take out a student loan. Some applicants have received part funding from their employers</p>\n<p><strong>Are there grants, trusts or scholarships for the course?</strong></p>\n<p>No grants are available. Some students have sought funding from other sources by consulting information on Education Awards in their local library. Other students have obtained a Career Development Loan from their bank.</p>\n<p><strong>May fees be paid over the course of a year or need full fees be paid at the outset of the academic year?</strong></p>\n<p>A full outline of the MSc Art Psychotherapy course fees and<a href=\"/study-here/postgraduate-study/2022/msc-art-psychotherapy/\"><strong> information on payment structure can be found on the MSc Art Psychotherapy course pages.</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>What sort of tutorial support is available to students?</strong></p>\n<p>Each student on the course has a personal academic tutor (PAT) whose role is to help the student to integrate the different parts of the course and to be aware of any circumstances affecting the student’s learning on the course. Tutors will meet with their tutees at least once per semester to review the student's work. In addition, students will receive weekly supervision as part of their placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there support within college with students with special educational needs?</strong></p>\n<p>A member of the course team is an academic disability student coordinator and is able to meet with students to discuss requirements and offer advice in liaison with the academic disability services. For example, students with dyslexia may be advised how to be assessed, where to find technological support, and what sorts of extra support is available. In addition, there are workshops within the university on essay preparation and some tutorials are offered for students whose first language is not English. QMU subscribes to an equal opportunities policy. There is an access hardship fund within the college to which students experiencing financial difficulties may apply. Information is available from <a href=\"mailto:registry@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>registry@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there studio facilities in the college for students wishing to continue with their own artwork?</strong></p>\n<p>There is currently one large art studio. Students can book this when it is not being used for teaching – and it is available during evenings and weekends. Students are encouraged to continue to pursue their own art-making practice and to find out about the media specific workshop facilities open to them in Edinburgh (e.g. sculpture, photography and printmaking). Students are also strongly encouraged to visit the many excellent museums and galleries in Edinburgh.</p>\n<p><strong>Do most students find employment after they graduate?</strong></p>\n<p>Employment opportunities vary with some regions of the UK offering more employment possibilities for qualified art psychotherapists than others. Some art psychotherapists will find employment in settings where their art psychotherapy knowledge combines with the requirements of the job. Examples would be a job as a project worker, art worker or family support worker within a community setting or a mental health practitioner within an NHS mental health team or school counselling service. Art psychotherapists find full, part-time and sessional work within statutory and voluntary sectors. Practice placement experience whilst a student contributes to an understanding of employment possibilities and enables students to consider realistically how to approach employment upon graduation.</p>\n<p>The British Association of Art Therapists (BAAT), the professional organisation which newly qualified Art Therapists may join, publishes, a journal (International Journal of Art Psychotherapy), a Newsletter, and circulates online information about art therapy posts in the UK. In addition, BAAT Regional Groups enable art therapists to keep in touch with one another and focus upon local and professional issues and developments. Within BAAT there are a number of special interest groups, such as Art Therapy and Education, Art Therapy and Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Art Therapy and Palliative Care, Art Therapy and Learning Disability, Art Therapy in Forensic Settings and Art Therapy Race and Culture, creating networks which in turn promote employment.</p>\n<p><strong>What support is offered to International students?</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend pre-sessional courses to all applicants whose first language is not English.</p>\n<p>Studies Department at QMU offers a range of preparatory English courses for students whose first language is not English. Interested students are advised to contact Recruitment &amp; International Liaison Office: telephone:+ 44 ( 0) 131 474 0000 email: <a href=\"mailto:international@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>international@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a>.
