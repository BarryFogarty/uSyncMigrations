<p><span class="lead">5. Compliance with the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act</span></p>
<p>The inclusion of the following statements in the University Procurement Strategy is mandatory to demonstrate how the University will deliver the requirements of the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">Statement on the University’s policy on the use of community benefit requirements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For every procurement over £4m, the institution will consider how it can improve the economic, social or environmental wellbeing of its area through inclusion of community benefit clauses, to assist with its strategic objectives of seeking out partnership and collaboration and embedding sustainability across our portfolio and practices. Such improvements could be implemented through mandated delivery of training opportunities or subcontracting opportunities within the University’s operating area. Where possible and proportionate, the University will also look to include such clauses in procurements below the £4m threshold.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Statement on the University’s policy on consulting and engaging with those affected by its procurements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For each procurement, the institution will consider the community affected by the resultant contract and ensure any affected organisations/persons are consulted (e.g. impact on service for students, or a local contract that could be combined with another similar institution’s needs). Such consultation will always be on a scale and approach relevant and proportionate to the procurement in question.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Statement on the University’s policy on the payment of a living wage to persons involved in producing, providing or constructing the subject matter of regulated procurements.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The institution recognises the values of a well-motivated and dedicated workforce both in its own organisation and in those of its suppliers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As an accredited Living Wage employer the institution will encourage the fair work practices of suppliers in its procurements, including the application of the Living Wage.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Statement on the University’s policy on promoting compliance by contractors and sub-contractors with the Health &amp; Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and any provision made under that Act . </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The institution is committed to contracting only with suppliers that comply with all appropriate and relevant legislation, including Health and Safety legislation and relevant University procedures. Where appropriate, and on a contract by contract basis, the institution will assess the legislation applicable to a procurement and take steps to ensure bidders comply with such legislation and relevant procedures. Where proportionate, the institution may also assess a subcontractor’s compliance with specific legislation.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Statement on the University’s policy on the procurement of fairly and ethically traded goods and services.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The University’s catering is Fair Trade and this supports the sourcing of goods that are fairly and ethically traded.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Where relevant it shall make use of appropriate standards and labels in its procurements to take account of fair and ethical trading considerations, and will consider equivalent offerings from suppliers in its tenders.</p>

<p><strong>Statement on the University’s policy on how it intends to ensure that its regulated procurements will be carried out in compliance with its duty to act in a transparent and proportionate manner.</strong></p>
<p>In making regulated procurement contract awards, quality, risk and sustainability factors will be considered along with cost according to declared score weightings on a contract-by-contract basis. The University will make appropriate use of collaborative contracting arrangements (e.g. national, sectoral or local framework agreements or contracts) to deliver improved contract terms, contract and supplier management, sustainable procurement outcomes and value for money.</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University will take steps to make it easier for smaller businesses to bid for contracts. Whilst legislative constraints preclude preferences for only local suppliers, the University will ensure that through the structure of its tender documentation, the use of Public Contracts Scotland and Public Contracts Scotland – Tender, and the publication of a contracts register to highlight contracts for which local organisations may be interested in bidding for, it provides information to smaller, local providers and assists them to build capacity to be able to meet these requirements.</p>
