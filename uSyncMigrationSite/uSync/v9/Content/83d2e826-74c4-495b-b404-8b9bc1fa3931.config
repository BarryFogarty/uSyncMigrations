      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>RECENTLY, QUEEN MARGARET </strong><strong>University marked the 30th </strong><strong>anniversary of its Institute for </strong><strong>Global Health and Development (IGHD) </strong><strong>– a multidisciplinary centre celebrated for </strong><strong>its postgraduate education and world leading </strong><strong>research on global health and </strong><strong>development.</strong></p>
<p>Over the last three decades, QMU’s global health experts have borne witness to numerous crises, conflicts and exceptional events in low- and middle-income countries. Their expertise has supported governments; international aid agencies; NGOs; and global institutions, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), to create solutions to tackle some of the world’s most pressing problems. Their work has ranged from improving women’s sexual and reproductive health in sub-Saharan Africa; building resilience in health systems in low and fragile settings such as Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Cambodia; assessing the impact of conflict on young Syrian refugees; creating safe spaces for children in areas of conflict; and the psychosocial wellbeing, protection and integration of migrant, refugee and other vulnerable populations here in Scotland.</p>
<p>Marking this important moment in QMU’s history with several anniversary events allowed the institution to celebrate the global impact of IGHD, whilst also showcasing its impressive capabilities so it can continue growing its sphere of influence and working collaboratively in its pursuit of a better and fairer world for all.</p>
<p>Professor Daniel Reidpath, Director of QMU’s Institute for Global Health and Development, explained:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="The Institute for Global Health and Development has been
unwavering in its commitment to develop and share knowledge that provides support and value to those working to improve health and wellbeing for all, particularly
for those enduring war, natural disaster, disease and environmental catastrophe." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>“By marking this important milestone, we recognised our growth and achievements over the last thirty years. The platform of our anniversary events also provided a timely opportunity to strengthen and extend<br>our collaboration with governments and international agencies so our knowledge and capabilities can support global health and development for those being left or pushed further behind.”</p>
<p>Sir Paul Grice, QMU’s Principal, said: “War in Ukraine and the escalation of events in the Middle East shine a light on the relevance of the expertise that has developed over the 30 years since the Institute for Global Health and Development was established at QMU. Now, more than ever, international leaders need to draw on our knowledge to help ease suffering and build capacity to deal with conflict and tragedy linked to world events.”</p>]]></Value>
