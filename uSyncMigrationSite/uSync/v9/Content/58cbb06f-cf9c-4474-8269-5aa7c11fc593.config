    "content": "<p>The MA Applied Arts and Social Practice focuses on the applied use of creative activities. It provide students with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience to best prepare them for applying the arts and creativity to areas such as third-sector organisations, public health, social welfare, education or criminal justice. It also aims to provide students with the enterprise skills to establish and market themselves as applied arts practitioners in a professional context.</p>\n<p>The current team’s expertise stems from community arts, applied theatre and socially engaged practice, and we define applied art as ‘creative processes and skills that are applied to a specific purpose or function.’ This could include any creative practice (such as theatre, art, music, dance or puppetry, just to name a few) that does not exist in traditional spaces (such as museums, theatres or galleries) but rather is based alongside and with individuals and communities in the public domain.</p>\n<p>You may find the course particularly suitable if you have already worked within social practice and want to broaden your understanding of your professional social practice. It also works well for people with significant workplace experience who want to gain a formal qualification in a flexible manner. The course is also suitable for recent graduates of fine, contemporary or performing arts courses especially those who have developed a set of artistic skills and want to learn how to apply them to projects in a social context.</p>\n<p>Over the past three decades within the UK, there has been a significant and sustained growth of the arts within a social context. Indeed, the current draft Cultural Strategy in Scotland looks at embedding artistic and creative practices across numerous sectors, inviting artists, theatre makers, musicians and all creative practitioners to be productive within industry, business, education and social settings.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the arts are becoming more important within health and wellbeing contexts and the recent national report ‘Creative Health: Arts for Health and Wellbeing’ calls for artists to play a vital role in the social health and well-being of the population to the extent that GPs in England can prescribe artistic activities in order to tackle social issues such as obesity, loneliness and depression. This MA will provide qualified students to service the growing demand for this type of creative practice.</p>"

It presents reflective opportunities by exploring case studies and live projects, as well as the student’s own experimentation. This module also receives insights from guest speakers and experts in the field who can speak of their own practical experience of engaging in applied arts/social practice projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Applied Arts: Theories and Histories (20 credits)</strong>- Taking a historical perspective as a grounding, this module examines the theoretical justification of Applied Arts, using case studies and past projects. It grounds the students thinking about the types of histories and legacies that can be drawn from to complicate the practices of engagement</p>\n<p><strong>Social Practice: Working With People (20 credits)</strong>- This module examines the practical skills required to engage with people, examining concepts such as dialogue, inter-personal skills, group facilitation skills. The most practical of the modules, students get to try out and engage with groups and communities in order to expand their skillsets and experience in working with people. </p>\n<p><strong>Fundraising, Finance and Development (20 credits)</strong> - This module will equip students with a critical understanding of the principles and practices of fundraising, development and financial management. The assessments invite students to examine financial support mechanisms (eg, completing a funding application or designing a sponsorship pack) as well as financial literacy exam. This module marks our course as quite unique in this regards. </p>\n<p><strong>Planning and Marketing Cultural Projects (20 credits)</strong> - This module will provide students with a critical understanding of the principal skills, techniques and practices necessary to manage and market a cultural project. This modules looks at the practical realities of managing and marketing cultural projects and learning occurs around hypothetical projects that the students plan and market in groups. </p>\n<p><strong>The Only Way is Ethics: Art Representation and Ethics (20 credits)</strong> - The module is designed to develop critical and practical skills needed for students to engage with the public in the delivery of cultural projects. It looks at examples from history as well as contemporaneous projects that engage with people at the ethical edges of participation to challenge the student to develop their own ethical frameworks. </p>\n<p>For the <strong>MA</strong>, you will also complete a <strong>final practice based project (60 credits).</strong></p>\n<p>For the <strong>PgCert</strong>, you need to complete three modules, of which at least TWO from the following</p>\n<p>Applied Arts: Theories and Histories of Applied Art</p>\n<p>Social Practice: Working with People </p>\n<p>Practice As Research </p>\n<p>And/or ONE of the following: </p>\n<p>Fundraising, Development and Finance </p>\n<p>Planning and Marketing Cultural Projects (20 credits)</p>\n<p>The Only Way is Ethic: Art, Representation and Ethics </p>\n<p>The modules listed are correct at time of posting (October 2021) but are subject to change.
