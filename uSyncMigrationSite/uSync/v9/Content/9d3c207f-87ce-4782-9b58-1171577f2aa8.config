      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The final preparations are being put in place and there will be some re-routing of vehicle access to the campus to ensure easy access for the public to the vaccination centre, and for those staff and students who need to work, study or live at the University.</p>
<p>Sir Paul Grice, Principal of Queen Margaret University, explained: “Throughout our history, the University has been focused on tackling some of the most pressing issues facing society. Today, there is no greater threat to our existence than COVID-19, so we are proud to play our part in supporting the biggest mass vaccination programme our country has ever undertaken.”</p>
<p>Sir Paul continued: “This is just one of many ways in which QMU has been supporting the response to COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, our academics have been quick to act, drawing on their expertise. For example, we have been investigating what services people need when they are recovering from the virus in isolation. Another of our multidisciplinary teams has been exploring the impact of restrictions during the pandemic on loneliness and isolation within Scotland’s refugee and asylum seekers’ community. In addition, we equipped our healthcare students to move quickly from university directly into professional roles within our NHS to support our healthcare service at a time of crisis. Beyond that, our students, graduates and staff teams have also worked tireless to lead and support all manner of community initiatives such the Empty Kitchens, Full Hearts social enterprise, led by one of our Gastronomy students, which has prepared thousands of healthy free meals for people in need during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Sir Paul concluded: “Supporting the development of the COVID-19 vaccination centre fits so well with Queen Margaret University’s purpose of helping to create a better society, and the value we place upon partnership, and I am thankful to all our staff who are working hard to support NHS Lothian in its delivery of this project.”</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC</strong></p>
<p>It is important to stress that the COVID-19 vaccination centre is run by NHS Lothian, and not the University. If any member of the community has questions about the virus or the vaccination centre based at QMU, they should direct all calls to the NHS COVID vaccination helpline on 0800 030 8013.</p>
<p>For health and safety reasons, the public are encouraged not to visit the site of the vaccination centre except if they have an appointment for a vaccination, and only then at the time they have their appointment.</p>
