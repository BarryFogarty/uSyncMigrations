A dietitian influences food selection and eating behaviour of an individual based on specific nutritional or food requirements.</p>\n<p>As a dietitian, you will translate scientific information about nutrition into practical advice to help people make health-conscious decisions about food. You will assess, diagnose and treat diet-related problems and aim to raise awareness of the link between food, health and disease to prevent future problems and treat existing nutrition-related problems. Dietitians are a key part of the healthcare team and are the only nutrition professionals to be statutorily regulated.</p>\n<p>The course takes you through a clinically and practically focused study of disease, health, food and nutrition. With a clinical and health promotion focus, the course includes three practice-based placements that allow students to apply and consolidate their theoretical learning.</p>"

This would then permit entry into the MSc Dietetics (pre-registration) course the following year.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that it can be difficult to get shadowing experience, so relevant experience that demonstrates transferable skills to those required by dietitians would be beneficial.</p>\n<p>International: You will be required to provide evidence of English language competence at no less than IELTS 7.0 and no individual component score below 6.5.</p>\n<p>Criminal Records Check: A satisfactory criminal records check will be required.</p>"
