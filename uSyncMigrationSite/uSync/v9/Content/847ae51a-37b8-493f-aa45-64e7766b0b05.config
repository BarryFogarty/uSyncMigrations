    "title": "About the course",
    "content": "<p>The events business has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, from pop-up food fairs to corporate events, fashion shows to festivals such as Glastonbury and school sports days to the London Olympics. Events help drive the strategies of businesses, charities and public bodies, and there is now a growing cadre of supremely capable events professionals. They know all about planning, management, legal issues, budgeting, staging, marketing, promotions, evaluation and social responsibility. This course will teach you these skills and give you that experience and more.</p>\n<p>You will also learn how to think critically about issues such as sustainability, crime, social justice, inclusion and what happens when the party is over. There are political considerations too, as many events and festivals are used to encourage tourism, regenerate communities and stimulate local economies such as our own world-famous Edinburgh festivals. Leading industry figures will bring your learning to life in guest lectures and networking opportunities.</p>\n<p>In Years One and Two you will focus on the specifics of events and festivals management, plus general management skills such as marketing, accounting and human resources.</p>\n<p>In Year Two you will put theory into action when you plan and deliver a live event. Our students have organised unforgettable fashion shows, music nights, charity dinners and sports days, often raising thousands of pounds for charities in the process. You will critically consider the purpose of events and their political and social impacts.</p>\n<p>Years Three and Four will deepen your understanding of how events and festivals relate to national and international strategic issues, such as how cities use events for image development and investment purposes. You will look at audience development and engagement, why do some ideas catch on instantly when others fade into obscurity? This is when you will refine the focus of your learning, choosing the elective modules that you are most passionate about. You will undertake a consultancy project for an events industry partner. If you continue to honours, you will develop leadership skills in international events and examine how events contribute to social justice. You will complete a dissertation in an area of your choice and undertake a placement within the events industry, preparing you for graduation and your future career.</p>\n<p>Finally, you will be learning all of this on a campus just six minutes by train from the heart of the city with the biggest arts festival on earth.</p>\n<p>The really big event of your life, your career, starts here!</p>"
