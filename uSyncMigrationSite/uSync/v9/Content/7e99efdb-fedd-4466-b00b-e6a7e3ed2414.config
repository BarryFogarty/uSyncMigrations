    "content": "<p>Derhoticisation is a process that is not easily studied from an auditory or acoustic perspective only. It is well known that /r/ is acoustically complex: different lingual gestures can produce similar acoustic outputs. (See Delattre and Freeman’s 1968 cineradiographic study of bunched and tip-up American /r/ and more recently Guenther et al. 1999, and Alwan and Narayanan (1996), using EPG and MRI.)</p>\n<p>Articulatory information is clearly required if we are to understand the phonetic and social processes involved in Scottish derhoticisation. The relatively young phonetic technique of ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) seemed very suitable as a technique.</p>"

Derhoticisation was less common than expected, and mainly occurred in weak syllables.</p>"

ECB08 (in two WC speakers) further reveals that this can affect /r/ in diphthongs and in some clusters: <em>hut</em> and <em>hurt</em> may be homophonous. In low back <em>fir</em>, <em>hurt</em>, <em>car</em> etc. the post-alveolar gesture has a negligible acoustic effect, because it occurs when source energy is weak or absent, i.e. in the voicelessness arising from a glottal(ised) allophone of /t/, or from the utterance-final position.</p>\n<p>Especially when following mid or high vowels, the root retraction gesture of /r/ gives rise to a clear acoustic difference between many lexemes contrasting only in the presence/absence of that /r/ (Figures 3, 4). Diphthongisation and breaking leads to the conclusion for many listeners that “/r/” is still present. An audible post-alveolar constriction may also remain, occurring before voicing has entirely ceased, or during breathy glottal energy in prepausal contexts. Finally, vowel duration may cue /r/ in some contexts, for some vowels.</p>\n<p>Previous work by Sproat and Fujimura (1993), Gick et al. (2003, 2006) and Byrd and Saltzman (2003) suggests that such root-tip gestural dissociation may be due to gesture lag in lengthened syllables that occur before major boundaries. But such articulatory factors interact with segmental, social and perceptual ones: derhoticisation is clearly socially stratified.</p>\n<p><em>Speakers intend to <strong>sound derhotic</strong> yet in suitable contexts they still <strong>articulate rhotic-like postalveolar gestures</strong>.</em></p>"

However, initial analysis of the MC informants’ tongue movements suggests that postvocalic /r/ might often have a bunched tongue configuration typical of American speech. Such differences are reported to have no acoustic consequences (Guenther et al 1999) so should not be socially stratified.</p>\n<p>- What conditioned variation is there (cf. Mielke et al. in press)? We are currently quantifying the range of different tongue shapes and intergestural timing relationships in onset, prepausal singleton /r/ and prepausal clusters. As well as examining the acoustic qualities. Our main focus is on the low back vowels like /ar/, which can be monophthongal.</p>"
