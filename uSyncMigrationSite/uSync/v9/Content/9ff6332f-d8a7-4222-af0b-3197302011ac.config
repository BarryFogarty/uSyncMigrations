      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Hazel Pritchett (35), from Stewarton in Ayrshire, was awarded the ‘Student of the Year’ title based on her academic commitment, evidence of progression and application of learning within the work environment.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">She also received a £100 cash prize in recognition of her academic excellence, which is sponsored by international hearing technology company, Starkey.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Hazel graduated with a Diploma in Higher Education Hearing Aid Audiology from QMU this summer, having been sponsored by her employer, Specsavers.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Better known as a national optician chain, Specsavers now has Hearing Centres offering free hearing tests with qualified hearing professionals.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Hazel is now progressing her career with Specsavers Hearing Centre at the Trongate Centre in Glasgow, where she is working with hearing impairment, its identification, the prescription and fitting of hearing aids and the rehabilitation and aftercare associated with hearing aid use.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The Diploma in Higher Education Hearing Aid Audiology at QMU has equipped Hazel with the skills required to practise as a hearing aid dispenser in the private sector or as an associate audiologist in the NHS.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Commenting on her Student of the Year award, Hazel, said: “I’m really flattered to have been named Hearing Aid Audiology Student of the Year at QMU and recognised for my academic achievements, as well as my patient care skills.</p>
<p>“The course has involved a lot of hard work, but the continued support from QMU and Specsavers Hearing Centres has enabled me to development my skills and career prospects.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Hazel’s academic supervisor and Lecturer in Audiology at QMU, Christine Johnson, said: “We’ve been very impressed with Hazel’s commitment to the profession. She has demonstrated the ability to apply what she has learnt and has worked well with her fellow students.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Hazel's supervisor at Specsavers Hearcare is Ryan Forbes. Commenting on her success, Mr Forbes said: “Hazel is a great attribute to the business and has worked incredibly hard, over and above the knowledge required.</p>
<p>“Hazel’s keenness to learn has clearly paid off and given her the accolade of student of the year! I am a very proud supervisor!”</p>]]></Value>
