      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong><span>Why are you particularly interested in Sports Rehabilitation as a career?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>I have always been fascinated with the human body and movement, and passionate about working with and helping people. I used to play football at an elite level, but a multitude of injuries in my late teens led to early retirement. My own experiences with injury and rehabilitation have driven my aspirations to help individuals in similar situations. I had always pictured myself studying physiotherapy, but when I learnt about the Sports Therapy course at Edinburgh College, which sounded more specific to my interests in sports, it seemed like the right fit. </span> </p>
<p><span>When it was time to apply for the Sports Rehabilitation degree at QMU in my final year at college, I was so excited to apply. I was eager to gain a degree in a field I’m really passionate about, build my confidence as a practitioner, and expand my knowledge, skills and practical experiences. What I really enjoy about sports rehabilitation is the combination of assessing and managing injuries, while specialising in exercise prescription. I have also learned that sports rehabilitation is for anyone, not just athletes, so it gives you an opportunity to work with all kinds of different people.  </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Tell us about your ambitions and where you see yourself in the future?</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>To be honest, I’m still trying to figure it out. My long-term dream is to open a performance</span><span> and rehabilitation centre for athletic populations. However, there’s a lot I want to do before I’m ready for that. I’m considering continuing my studies to Master’s degree level in something like Sports Physiotherapy. A few job roles that excite me are rehabilitation within the Military of Defence (</span><span>MOD) </span><span>or working in professional sports.</span><span> <br></span><span> <br></span><span>What have you most enjoyed about your course in Sports Rehabilitation at QMU? </span><span>It’s been great to have placements run across the entire academic year, which have allowed me to apply everything we learn in class in practice. I have been really fortunate to experience both professional sports and private clinical practice through my placements. It has given me the opportunity to work with athletes as well as the general population, and experience a lot of different injuries and conditions, as well as management approaches. </span> </p>
<p><strong><span>Can you tell us a bit more about your placements?</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>In my 3</span><span data-fontsize="12">rd</span><span> year, I had an internship with Edinburgh Rugby. As I’ve always been interested in sports, it was an amazing opportunity for me to work with athletes and learn from </span> </p>
<p><span>experie</span><span>nced professionals in the field. I got to work with academy and professional athletes in both prevention and rehabilitation management. I was part of a multidisciplinary team and saw how much work goes on behind the scenes. I really enjoyed learning about the sport, as well as and position-specific rehabilitation, while also considering the individual player.</span> </p>
<p><span>In my 4</span><span data-fontsize="12">th</span> <span>year, I’ve been on placement in a private clinic. It’s been great because it’s completely different from my other placement. My goal was to get as much confidence and self-efficacy, and work with a wider range of patients and injuries. I’ve had much more hands-on experience, leading on case studies and seeing injuries and conditions I never would have come across in a sporting environment. It’s also encouraged me to do more research when presented with something you don’t necessarily know much about. Working with the general population is rewarding in a different way, where sometimes people come to you just wanting a better quality of life.</span><span> </span> </p>
<p><strong>How have your lecturers supported your learning? </strong></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="The staff have been approachable and always there to support my learning and student experience in any way, whether it has been academical or extra support needed due to personal matters. They have been good at suggesting and signposting resources that could help my learning in different areas of my studies. " source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p><strong>What have been some of your challenges with the course and university life?  </strong></p>
<p><span>One of the biggest challenges I faced when I started the degree was my time-management, which with practice has improved so much and made me a better student. The group work was initially a challenge, learning to work with people who work very differently to yourself. Finding and understanding everyone’s individual strengths and weaknesses has been helpful to get the best outcomes. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in taking up a Sports Rehabilitation course?</strong></p>
<p><span>If you are interested in how the body wor</span><span>ks and enjoy working with people, give it a go! </span><span> <br></span><span>There is a misconception that sport rehabilitation is only for athletes, but it can be for anyone. So, whether you want to work in professional sports, exercise for mental health or to help improve quality of life for people with long-term conditions, this degree can help prepare you for that. I always considered physiotherapy, but what really sets sports rehabilitation apart - and what was appealing to me - is that you become an expert in exercise prescription. It’s like a hybrid b</span><span>etween physiotherapy and strength and conditioning. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>What’s your ‘top tip’ for making the most out of being a student? </strong></p>
<p><span>Time-management! Balancing the work-life balance can be tricky, but if you are organised, you have the opportunity to make the most of the experience. The self-directed learning is an essential part to make time for, on top of everything else, but it will really help you excel in your classes.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span>What has been the most valuable lesson that you’ve learned at university?</span></strong><strong><span> </span></strong> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Enjoying what you’re doing makes the challenging parts easier. Also, understanding that there is always room to expand your knowledge and skills and learning from others. You are not expected to know everything. " source="" sourceExtra="" />]]></Value>

She was particularly keen to apply when she realised that after completing two years on the College course, she could articulate directly onto the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/2024/bsc-hons-sports-rehabilitation-2024-entry/">BSc (Hons) Sports Rehabilitation</a> at Queen Margaret University. The new degree at QMU is the only accredited course of its kind in Scotland. </span></p>]]></Value>
