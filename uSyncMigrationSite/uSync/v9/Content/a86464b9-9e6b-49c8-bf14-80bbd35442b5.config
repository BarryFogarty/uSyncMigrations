      <Value><![CDATA[<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Status</strong><br />Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh is an autonomous Scottish higher education institution. The <br />University’s governing instruments and arrangements are set out under the Queen Margaret <br />University, Edinburgh (Scotland) Order of Council 2007, amended from 1 October 2019 through <br />the Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh (Scotland) Amendment Order of Council 2019. The <br />2007 Order is made under section 45 of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992.<br />The University is registered under the Companies Acts as a company limited by guarantee, with <br />its registered office at Queen Margaret University Drive, Musselburgh, East Lothian, EH21 6UU.<br />The University has been entered into the Scottish Charity Register and is entitled, in accordance <br />with section 13(1) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, to refer to itself as <br />a Charity registered in Scotland.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Scope of the Financial Statements</strong><br />The financial statements presented on pages 26 to 54 comprise the consolidated results of the <br />University and its subsidiary company, QMU Enterprises Limited. QMU Enterprises Limited <br />undertakes commercial consultancy work, utilising the expertise of the University’s academic and <br />technical staff, and deals with vacation letting of the University’s student accommodation. The <br />University holds 50% of the issued share capital of Edinburgh Innovation Park Joint Venture <br />Company Limited. Due to the limited activity to date within the joint venture company, the results <br />have not been consolidated into these financial statements. Further information is provided in note <br />13 to the financial statements.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with<br />Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102) and the Statement of Recommended Practice –<br />Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 (SORP 2019), with the Accounts Direction <br />issued by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) and with the United Kingdom Companies Acts.<br />Information on the process which has been undertaken to inform the decision to prepare the <br />financial statements on a going concern basis is set out in section (A) in the statement of principal <br />accounting policies and include details in respect of a material uncertainty due to the material loan <br />repayment currently due within the going concern period.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Development of the Strategic Plan</strong><br />The University’s strategic plan remains rooted in the University’s core values, and sets out a <br />number of strategic goals, along with targets to be achieved by the end of the current plan period <br />in 2025. The plan is supported by a more detailed delivery plan, which sets out specific actions, <br />along with timescales and owners, which will enable the achievement of the strategic plan goals <br />and targets. A key element of the plan remains the inclusion of key performance indicators which <br />the University Court uses to monitor progress towards the achievement of the goals set out in the <br />plan (both financial and non-financial). The University also has processes to manage the risks <br />which might inhibit this achievement</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Results for the year </strong></p>

<p>The main changes in the underlying outturn position compared to 2021/22 were:-</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase of £1.0 million in income from tuition fees and education contracts, including <br />additional students on new programmes, and an increase in international student numbers;</li>
<li>An increase in SFC grants of £0.6 million. This included additional funding for the initial teacher <br />education programme, paramedic science programme and additional funding for Physio;</li>
<li>A reduction of £0.7 million in income from research grants and contracts;</li>
<li>An increase in other income of £1.0 million, as both summer school activity and <br />accommodation occupancy improved;</li>
<li>An increase of £0.7 million in staff costs, of which £2.5 million related to the reduction in <br />pension provision adjustments, with the remaining increase reflecting salary increases;</li>
<li>An increase of £1.5 million in other operating expenses, reflecting increases in utilities and <br />maintenance spending.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Additional information on the adjustments relating to the revaluation of land and buildings and <br />to actuarial gains and losses on pension schemes is provided in notes 12 and 21 respectively.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">QMU Enterprises Ltd generated a profit of £347,000 (2021/22: £157,000), which was passed to <br />the University under deed of covenant.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Cash Flows and Liquidity</strong><br />The result for the year, adjusted for the effect of non-cash items and interest, was a net cash inflow <br />of £4.5 million on operating activities (2021/22, £7.9 million inflow). Overall cash balances <br />increased by £2.2 million (2021/22; £0.4 million reduction). Unrestricted cash balances at 31 July <br />2023 of £17.5 million (2022: £15.2 million) represented 141 days’ expenditure (2022: 136 days).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Management of Principal Risks and Uncertainties</strong><br />In common with other universities, Queen Margaret University has to manage its activities whilst <br />facing significant pressures on its funding as well as on its cost base. Significant risks facing the <br />University include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding from government through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC), the University’s main <br />source of income, is likely to suffer from further real-terms reductions over the next few years <br />as a consequence of spending cuts throughout the public sector.</li>
<li>Pressure on staff costs will continue to build, both in terms of pay awards (where the University <br />continues to participate in the UK-wide national negotiating framework) and also in terms of <br />the cost of employers’ pension contributions.</li>
<li>Long term inflationary pressure on non staff costs are challenging and along with staff costs <br />are to be addressed in the review of our operating model .</li>
<li>The ability to attract and retain staff, particularly in some specialist areas, is becoming more <br />difficult throughout the economy, including in the University sector.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The identification and management of risks is firmly embedded within the University’s structure <br />and processes. An updated risk management strategy was adopted by the University Court in <br />2021. The institutional corporate risk register, which includes a description of actions undertaken <br />to mitigate risks, is formally reviewed by the Senior Leadership Team and the Audit &amp; Risk <br />Committee as well as being discussed by the University Court. The Court also undertakes, from <br />time to time, an exercise to agree its appetite for risk, and to ensure that residual risks, after the <br />application of mitigating actions, sit within the agreed tolerance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Financial Sustainability and Going Concern</strong><br />The University Court has assessed the financial position of the University for the year ended 31 <br />July 2023. The assessment period considered is the period to 31 July 2025 and further details of <br />this assessment can be found on page 30. The University Court has assessed a number of factors <br />as set out below and has concluded that there is an expectation that the University has adequate <br />financial resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future while recognising that a <br />material uncertainty exists within the going concern assessment, solely due to the expiry of the <br />Barclays loan in December 2024.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In reaching its conclusion, the University Court has considered the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the balance sheet date the University had net current assets of £10 million.</li>
<li>Cash balances at 31 July 2023 amounted to £17.5 million. The University had liquid reserves <br />(cash and investments) as at 31 July 2023 equivalent to approximately four months’ operating <br />cash requirements.</li>
<li>In the year to 31 July 2023 the University made an underlying surplus of £0.3 million before <br />pension provision adjustments, and generated positive net cash from operating activities of <br />£4.5 million. The University cash flow forecast shows an increasing cash trajectory over the <br />period to 31 July 2025, and no additional financing will be required to meet its liabilities.</li>
<li>At the balance sheet date, the University had external financing liabilities of £19.5 million, of<br />which £17.2 million is payable to Barclays Bank plc with the remainder being payable to the <br />Scottish Funding Council. As set out in Note 16, the University intends to enter into discussions <br />around refinancing the element of the Barclays loan which will remain outstanding at the<br />scheduled repayment date of 17 December 2024. Early discussions indicate that the <br />University are in a strong position to refinance the outstanding amount and with updated <br />business reflective covenants.</li>
<li>All bank loan covenants were complied with for the year ended 31 July 2023.</li>
<li>In relation to future years, Management has modelled plausible downside scenarios based on <br />a number of adverse scenarios taking place in financial year 2024/25, including a cash-terms <br />reduction in SFC grants, a reduction of planned tuition fee growth, and pay and affected non <br />pay costs remaining higher than forecast. In these scenarios, assuming the existence of <br />continued loan financing, the University retains liquidity headroom and compliance with <br />covenants through the going concern period with both plausible and available mitigating <br />actions being undertaken. These mitigations include, but are not limited to, reducing <br />uncommitted future spend on discretionary capital and maintenance programmes, seeking <br />SFC funding advances and, only if necessary, reducing staff numbers.</li>
<li>Management is confident the loan will be refinanced to the extent required to ensure sufficient <br />liquidity is retained by the University. Should the loan not be refinanced and be due for <br />repayment in full, without additional financing the Group and University headroom in its base <br />case going concern projections would be £ 3.1 million. Severe but plausible downside <br />scenarios erode the remaining headroom up to the period of 31 July 2025 and additional <br />financing would be required.</li>
<li>Taking account of the business risks facing the University, we believe that the University and <br />the group are well placed to continue to manage their business risks successfully.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In accordance with the recommendations from the Higher Education Financial Sustainability <br />Strategy Group (FSSG), the University Court undertakes a formal annual assessment of the <br />University’s financial sustainability. This process involves reviewing a common set of financial <br />indicators, which have been applied to the University’s historical results and to the financial <br />forecasts measured over a rolling five-year period, so as to reduce the impact of any one-off <br />exceptional items arising in any year. The two key indicators which the University Court has agreed <br />to focus upon to inform its considerations around financial sustainability are:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA); and</li>
<li>Net cash flow from operating activities less interest payable as a percentage of turnover.</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The second indicator has been adapted from the basket of financial indicators recommended by <br />the FSSG as it is a more appropriate measure for the University, given its relatively high level of <br />borrowings as a proportion of its turnover. The targets are also set at a level which will allow <br />compliance with banking covenants. The results of the annual review undertaken in October 2023, <br />based on a rolling five-year period, were as follows:-</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The <em>EBITDA</em> average percentage remains above the five-year average target and maintains the <br />figure from July. The “Net cash flow from operating activities less interest payable as a percentage <br />of turnover” indicator remains well above target, reflecting the University’s relatively strong cash <br />position.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Borrowings</strong><br />Borrowings at 31 July 2023 amounted to £19.5million (31 July 2022, £21.2 million). Of this amount, <br />£17.2 million related to a secured loan facility with Barclays Bank plc taken out to fund the campus <br />development at Musselburgh, and £2.4 million related to an unsecured loan from the Scottish <br />Funding Council under the Financial Transactions scheme.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Barclays Bank funding arrangement will expire on 17th December 2024 and will be refinanced <br />in advance. Early discussions have commenced with the incumbent and will progress to a full <br />market tender beginning in January 2024.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Pension arrangements</strong><br />The University is involved in three pension schemes, as follows:-</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Lothian Pension Fund</strong><br />The Lothian Pension Fund is part of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) and is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme. The scheme’s last funding valuation took place as at 31 March <br />2020 and set contributions from 1 April 2021. The funding valuation showed a positive position with <br />an overall funding position of 106%. The Fund trustees have, in recent years, applied increases to <br />the level of employers’ and employees’ contributions to the scheme in order to maintain the strong <br />funding position. The next triennial funding valuation was performed as at 31 March 2023 and will <br />set contribution rates from 1 April 2024. Results are expected in early 2024.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The University’s share of the fund for 31 July 2023 is a net asset of £23.4 million (31 July 2022<br />restated: £18.6 million net asset). The University has recognised the pension asset at 31 July 2023<br />in accordance with the accounting policy adopted as set out in accounting policy (D).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Scottish Teachers’ Superannuation Scheme</strong><br />The University participates in the Scottish Teachers’ Superannuation Scheme (STSS). The <br />scheme is an unfunded statutory public service pension scheme with benefits underwritten by the <br />UK Government. The scheme is financed by payments from employers and from those current <br />employees who are members of the scheme and paying contributions at progressively higher <br />marginal rates based on pensionable pay, as specified in the regulations. The rate of employer <br />contributions is set with reference to a funding valuation undertaken by the scheme actuary. The <br />last four-yearly valuation was undertaken as at 31 March 2016. This valuation informed an increase <br />in the employer contribution rate from 17.2% to 23.0% of pensionable pay from September 2019 <br />and an anticipated yield of 9.4% employees contributions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Queen Margaret University has no liability for other employer’s obligations to the multi-employer <br />scheme and, as the scheme is unfunded, there can be no deficit or surplus to distribute on the wind <br />up of the scheme or withdrawal from it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The scheme is an unfunded multi-employer defined benefit scheme. It is accepted that the scheme <br />can be treated for accounting purposes as a defined contribution scheme in circumstances where <br />the University is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The employer contribution rate for the period from 1 April 2022 is 23% of pensionable pay. The <br />employee rate applied is variable and is anticipated to provide a yield of 9.4% of pensionable pay.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">While a valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2016, it is not possible to say what deficit or <br />surplus may affect future contributions. Work on the valuation was suspended by the UK <br />Government pending the decision from the Court of Appeal (McCloud (Judiciary scheme)/Sargeant <br />(Firefighters’ Scheme) cases) that held that the transitional protections provided as part of the 2015 <br />reforms was unlawfully discriminated on the grounds of age. Following consultation and an announcement in February 2021 on proposals to remedy the discrimination, the UK Government <br />confirmed that the cost control element of the 2016 valuations could be completed. The UK <br />Government has also asked the Government Actuary to review whether, and to what extent, the <br />cost control mechanism is meeting its original objectives. The 2020 actuarial valuations will take <br />the report’s findings into account. The interim report is complete (restricted) and is currently being <br />finalised with a consultation. Alongside these announcements, the UK Government confirmed that <br />current employer contribution rates would stay in force until 1 April 2024.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Universities Superannuation Scheme</strong><br />The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) is a hybrid pension scheme, providing defined <br />benefits (for all members), as well as defined contribution benefits. The assets of the scheme are <br />held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Because of the mutual nature of the scheme, the <br />assets are not attributed to individual institutions and a scheme-wide contribution rate is set. The <br />University is therefore exposed to actuarial risks associated with other institutions’ employees and <br />is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent <br />and reasonable basis. As required by Section 28 of FRS 102 (Employee Benefits), the University <br />therefore accounts for the scheme as if it were a wholly defined contribution scheme. As a result, <br />the amount charged to the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure <br />represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The University has entered into an agreement (the Recovery Plan) that determines how each <br />employer within the scheme will fund the overall deficit and accordingly recognises a liability for <br />the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) <br />and therefore an expense is recognised in the income and expenditure account.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The most recent fund valuation as at 31 March 2023 demonstrates both a material increase in the <br />Plan value and reduction in the Plan deficit, driven by favourable economic conditions and resulting <br />inflationary benefits. Proposals resulting from the valuation are under consultation and will be <br />completed by the legislative deadline of 30 June 2024.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Further details on pension arrangements are set out in note 21 to the financial statements.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Social Inclusion</strong><br />Queen Margaret University aims to promote entry to, and provide education at, undergraduate and <br />postgraduate level to a diverse range of students, whatever their background. In assessing <br />candidates for admission to the University, we are committed to the principles of fairness, <br />transparency, and widening participation. Our Contextual Admissions Policy commits to making <br />offers to identified groups where we recognise that a range of factors may have impacted on <br />attainment. We offer a range of recruitment, outreach, pre and post entry activities to raise <br />aspiration, encourage access and maximise retention from under-represented groups in line with <br />our Student Experience strategy, Mainstreaming Report and Equality Outcomes, and underpinned <br />by the University’s Outcome Agreement with the Scottish Funding Council.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Student Satisfaction</strong><br />The University participates in the National Student Survey. Overall satisfaction in the 2023 <br />results was 74%, a decrease of 2.4% compared to 2022 and 2.2% below the University's <br />benchmark set by The Office for Students. While a number of programmes achieved over 90% for <br />overall satisfaction, and benchmark data showed the University was above or the same as the <br />benchmark in 10 of the 28 core questions, industrial action and external changes to placement <br />provision had impacted negatively on a number of other programmes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Graduate Employment</strong><br />Our Employability Strategy brings together in a single document our approach to employability, <br />with the primary objective of providing equitable employment and careers education to all students<br />and graduates, providing a public statement of our commitment to their success. We consider that <br />our efforts are proving highly effective.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As a result of all of our efforts to develop students’ employability - at 2%, the University has the <br />lowest level of unemployment in Scotland for its graduates 15 months after they have graduated. <br />The average figure for Scotland is 5%. In addition, we are in the top 6 of Scottish universities for <br />the number of graduates in full-time employment 15 months after they have graduated. (Graduate <br />Outcome Statistics 2020/21, published by HESA in 2023).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Environmental Issues</strong><br />The University made its first significant contribution to climate change with the move to new <br />sustainability designed and delivered campus in 2007. This was recognised though accreditation <br />of BREEAM excellent and CEEQUAL standards with the former achieving the highest ever score <br />recorded for an HE institution. The campus development reduced our annual operational carbon <br />mission by 38% and the holistic approach we adopted to environmental sustainability has ensured <br />that further operational based awards have been achieved. These include recognition for our low <br />carbon IT solutions, renewable fuel sources and a range of active travel awards. Our ongoing <br />commitment to the environment ensures that our CO2 emissions per student are regularly amongst <br />the very lowest across the UK HE sector.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Future Developments</strong><br />In order to take advantage of further opportunities as they arise, the University is continuing to <br />focus on ensuring that its academic, infrastructure, digital, human resources and financial <br />strategies are closely aligned. The University continues to make good progress in a number of <br />areas which will ensure that it is able to achieve the objectives set out in its strategic plan during <br />the period through to 2025. This will, in turn, allow the University to continue to generate an <br />adequate level of cash in the short to medium term and to maintain an adequate level of reserves.<br />The Court carries out regular monitoring of the University’s financial sustainability, as described <br />above.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The funding environment for Scottish higher education institutions was already challenging, with <br />sector-level evidence that funding for publicly funded teaching and research was insufficient to <br />cover the full cost of delivery. Whilst additional non-recurrent funding was made available to <br />mitigate the financial losses arising from COVID, indications from the most recent Scottish <br />Government spending review are that funding settlements for the next five years are likely to be at <br />a flat-cash level, which represents a significant reduction in real terms. Universities continue to<br />face significant pressures on costs, particularly staff costs and inflation impacted non pay costs. In <br />order to address this position, the University has recently developed a five-year proposition, <br />covering the period to 2027. This proposition involves targeting developments in three main areas, <br />as follows:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing postgraduate student numbers;</li>
<li>Developing new online provision at scale; and</li>
<li>Growth in transnational education partnerships.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The long term financial health of the University will continue to depend upon its ability to grow and <br />diversify its income base, and to control costs, whilst making available sufficient funds needed as <br />an upfront investment to enable the growth areas noted above to take place.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>On behalf of the University Court</strong><br />Pamela Woodburn<br />Chair<br />13 December 2023</p>]]></Value>
