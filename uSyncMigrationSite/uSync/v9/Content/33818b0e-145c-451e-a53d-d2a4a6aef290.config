<p><strong>Studentships and scholarships</strong></p>
<p>Many self-funding students have secured scholarships from funding bodies (including employers, foundations and trusts) themselves, and students are recommended to pursue such opportunities rigorously as the number of QMU-funded scholarships is heavily oversubscribed.  Each year QMU offers a small number of PhD studentships, which cover all tuition and bench fees and offer support towards living costs. Applications for studentships will be invited once a year (normally in January) and publicised on our website. Studentships can only be awarded for research proposals in the advertised topics. </p>
<p><strong>Fees and funding</strong></p>
<p>All other applicants must pay their own fees and living costs, or find an external sponsor to support them. </p>
<p><strong>Entry qualifications</strong></p>
<p>To apply for a master’s research degree, you should hold, or anticipate gaining, a good honours degree from a UK higher education institution, or a degree from an overseas institution accepted by the University as an equivalent. Applicants without an honours degree may only be considered if they can demonstrate equivalent professional experience in a relevant field. All overseas students must provide evidence of their English language ability. A minimum score of IELTS 6.5 or equivalent, with no element of performance lower than IELTS 6.0, is the entrance requirement for applicants who have not completed a degree taught and assessed in English. You must also produce an outline research proposal that we judge to be feasible and appropriate for the level of study, and that is in a field we can supervise. Finally, you will need to be interviewed. Interviews may take place in person or by telephone. </p>
<p><strong>Support for research degree students</strong></p>
<p>QMU is a forward-thinking higher education institution with an exciting future. It is a particularly good time to consider study at QMU. With a dedicated team of supervisors for each candidate and specialist training offered in key aspects of academic research, we believe that you will have the best possible chance of success in your studies.  Each candidate is allocated a team of two or three supervisors to provide support and advice. In addition, we provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>three doctoral development weeks per year offering various workshops and training opportunities to attend further workshops for training in specific skills;  </li>
<li>a dedicated research librarian to help you make the most of our library and electronic databases; </li>
<li>a network of peer support from other research students in our Graduate School; and</li>
<li>opportunities to attend research seminars and learn from other experienced researchers, </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to apply for a doctoral degree</strong></p>
<p>You may apply for either part-time or full-time study. Normally you will be based at QMU. In certain circumstances applications may be considered for non-resident students. Such applications will only be considered where appropriate support can be provided locally and on the understanding that the student will visit Edinburgh at least twice per year to meet with their supervisory team, attend doctoral development weeks, undertake assessment points, including the final viva and connect with the QMU research community. To apply you must complete the online application form and provide the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>a research proposal  </li>
<li>a copy of certificates and transcripts for your highest level academic qualifications (normally master’s/undergraduate degree) including official translations into English and if required evidence of English language ability  </li>
<li>two references, one of which must be academic if you have studied within three years of the start date </li>
</ul>
<p>Those applying for PhD by Publication should also include a publication plan and, where appropriate, a list of prior publications, indicating their contribution to each.  We strongly recommend that you make contact with potential supervisors before submitting your application.   </p>
<p><strong>Research proposal</strong></p>
<p>All applicants must provide a proposal. This allows us to check how well you understand the research process and to make sure the topic is in an area we can supervise. </p>
<p>The research topic must be within the expertise of our staff. The topic must have academic merit and it must be capable of generating new knowledge. Research that is linked to the applicant’s creative work may be considered. </p>
<p>It is essential that you check whether QMU has any expertise in your chosen field. See our <a href="http://www.qmu.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-research-study/graduate-school-and-doctoral-research/">Graduate School webpages for further information on the areas we cover. </a> The proposal should be approximately 1000 words long. The proposal should: </p>
<ul>
<li>summarise what the research is about and say why it is important, making reference to current literature;  </li>
<li>identify provisional research questions; and  </li>
<li>suggest how the questions can be investigated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visa information</strong></p>
<p>Since 1 July 2021, international students who have successfully completed a PhD are able to benefit from three years’ work experience in the UK upon graduation, through the new Graduate Route.
