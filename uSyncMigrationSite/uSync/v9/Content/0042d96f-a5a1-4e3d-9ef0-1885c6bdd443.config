      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Have you joined any schemes/initiatives to enhance your learning and development, such as a mentoring scheme, volunteering scheme, etc.? </span></p>
<p>I am on the Student/Staff Consultative Committee. This is a great way to strengthen relationships with staff as well as provide a voice for your class as a whole. We also organise days/nights out for the class to encourage relationship building and having a great time in general.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Have you won any awards/scholarship/internships, etc., that have helped you develop skills and experience? If so, please tell us about them.</span></p>
<p>I have been awarded an International Scholarship from QMU. This has helped considerably with the financial side of being an international student! I highly recommend applying for scholarships if you are studying abroad.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">Life as a Student at QMU</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What’s your ‘top tip’ for making the most of being a student?</span></p>
<p>My top tip for making the most of being a student is to attend the events promoted by the University and your course in particular. These are an excellent way to meet new people and expand your network. Also, make use of the facilities that QMU offers; as Physiotherapy students, when studying for exams, we can use the practical rooms and models. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What are your plans after graduation? Tell us about your ambitions and where you see yourself in the future?</span></p>
<p>Being raised in a small community in Southwestern Ontario, I acknowledge the lack of resources in rural areas. I hope to one day open up my own practice in a rural setting. I am a strong supporter of local practices that enable greater accessibility to those who cannot acquire care in a reasonable time frame and hope to evoke an overall community interest in achieving and maintaining well-balanced health and wellbeing. Hence, I recognise the value and the challenges of a small community and therefore feel motivated to help improve societal standards for health.</p>
<p>Before opening up my practice, however, I can see myself working in various countries. Not only will this help me gain perspective, but it will also allow me to continue building on my techniques and professionalism as a physiotherapist. </p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">About you</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Tell us a little about yourself.</span></p>
<p>My name is Colby, and I grew up in a small rural town in Ontario, Canada. Health and wellbeing have always been a significant part of my life – I achieved a health and wellness high skills award in high school and then went on to complete a Bachelor of Science degree with specialised honours in Kinesiology and Health Science at York University in Toronto. After completion of my BSc, I chose to take time away from academia to gain experiences, look for further opportunities and embark on a journey of personal growth. During this time, I travelled to Thailand, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, France, Holland, the UK and Ireland. I have gained a great deal of knowledge and cultural experiences through my travels that are likely to be extremely beneficial to my future career in Physiotherapy. As a future Physiotherapist, I aspire to be able to share my knowledge and passion of the subject with individuals all across the world to empower a higher quality of life.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study at QMU?</span></p>
<p>I chose QMU, as I’ve always wanted to study abroad. I believe that interacting with people from various cultures and taking a different approach to the academic experience adds value to an individual’s learning process and personal development.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh?</span></p>
<p>Edinburgh is such a diverse, historical and beautiful city. There are always events, markets and other new things to explore – so you'll never be short of things to do in your study breaks! In particular, I like how the city almost has a small-town feel as they have a great sense of community and such friendly people.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">The Course </span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been your highlight?</span></p>
<p>I have been able to develop and enhance skills that are necessary for becoming a Physiotherapist, such as communication and professionalism, through a series of practical classes. Furthermore, the skills that we make use of every day are transferrable to our practice, as witnessed through placements.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Has there been a particular course activity you found especially interesting?</span></p>
<p>We were able to attend a human cadaver laboratory which was a very informative, insightful and beneficial experience for anyone studying Physiotherapy.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How have your lecturers supported your learning?</span></p>
<p>The lecturers at QMU are very supportive and helpful. They ensure you are supported in all aspects of your university experience – from academic work to emotional and financial support, and anything else in between. They develop professional relationships with students, so we get the best experience possible.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What have been some of your challenges with the course and university life? How have you overcome them?</span></p>
<p>The biggest challenge when moving abroad is probably moving away from your friends and family, which can leave you feeling slightly vulnerable. However, I found that, especially as there are so many international students, many people are in a similar situation and are keen on meeting others. Everyone is very friendly at QMU, and as you have similar interests to your classmates, it should be quite easy to make new friends.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">Any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></p>
<p>I would recommend visiting the campus and having a day out in Edinburgh. QMU’s campus is modern and compact, which makes it easy to become familiar with the space. It’s easy to see why people fall in love with the city, and you should experience that for yourself.</p>]]></Value>
