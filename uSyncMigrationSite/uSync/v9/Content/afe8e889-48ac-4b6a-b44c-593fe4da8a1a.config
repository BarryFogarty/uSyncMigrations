Learners will be supported throughout the course by their Clinical Guide.</p>\n<p>A Clinical Guide is someone selected by the learner to support them through their learning journey. They should be encouraging and supportive, but also provides honest and often candid feedback.</p>\n<p>Learners will agree an individual Learning Action Plan through tripartite discussion between themselves, their clinical guide and their personal academic tutor at QMU.</p>\n<p>This will allow learners flexibility to define the competencies and other learning activities needed to develop their own practice. Assessments will be discussed at the beginning of each specific module.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Work-based learning</strong></span></p>\n<p>Learners will complete the course in their substantive clinical post.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></span></p>\n<p>A notional 480 hours (equivalent to 7.5 hours a week) of protected learning time, towards this portfolio and associated time for self-directed study has been proposed for this course.</p>\n<p>These hours can be used as is best suited to each learner and their individual situation. Some of these hours will be used towards synchronous (live) sessions, spending time with colleagues within the Integrated Community Team, self-directed study and viewing recorded sessions.</p>\n<p>As this is an academic programme of study, learners will need to commit to self-directed learning in addition to these notional hours.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Teaching staff</strong></span></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>"
