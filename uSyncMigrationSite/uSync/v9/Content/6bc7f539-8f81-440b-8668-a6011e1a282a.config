The aim is to ensure that communities can all make a positive contribution to support those living with dementia.</p>
<p>Bold is running a free taster event on Wednesday 27th November, between 10am and 1pm at Carberry House, Musselburgh. </p>
<p>Professor Brendan McCormack, Bold project lead and Head of the Division of Nursing and Occupational &amp; Arts Therapies at QMU, said: “I am delighted that we are bringing the next Bold Scotland Leadership School to East Lothian. Queen Margaret University is at the heart of the East Lothian community and being able to contribute something to this community is very exciting. East Lothian is an excellent area for Bold to next connect with, given the amount of work that is already happening to help persons living with dementia to flourish. Bold Scotland will connect with this work and offer a complementary route for bringing about flourishing communities.”</p>
<p>He added: “The ‘Taste of Leadership’ sessions are a great opportunity to experience the culture, values and ethos of Bold first hand. These taster sessions provide a way for those who might be thinking about joining the Bold Scotland programme to ‘give it a go’. Working in a safe space with like-minded colleagues and facilitators, we enable everyone to experience our ways of working and consider the potential of what might be possible if you participate in the full programme.</p>
<p>“Our goal in Bold Scotland is to create flourishing communities where having a dementia diagnosis doesn’t matter to how we live our lives. Living with dementia means just that - LIVING! All persons affected by dementia have that right. While there are many programmes, projects, initiatives and opportunities available across East Lothian that are contributing to making it a good place to live, we hope that Bold Scotland adds to this diverse mix and affords opportunities for participants to lead on changes needed, no matter how small, and remove labels that get in the way of ‘living a flourishing life.” </p>
