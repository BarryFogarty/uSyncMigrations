<p>This grievance procedure should not be used to complain about dismissal or disciplinary action. If you are dissatisfied with any disciplinary action, you should submit an appeal under the disciplinary procedure.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>If you have any grievance in relation to your employment you should normally raise the matter initially with your immediate manager informally. Many potential grievances can be resolved informally and managers and staff are encouraged to try and resolve issues using this approach. Where appropriate the University may consider the use of mediation to try and resolve the issue at an early stage.</p>
<p>If you are uncertain whether your complaint should be raised under the grievance procedure or one of the other University complaint processes, you should contact HR in the first instance and they will provide advice.</p>
<p>If attempts to resolve the grievance informally are unsuccessful and you wish to raise a formal grievance you should contact Human Resources for advice and guidance in following the formal grievance process.</p>
<p>Written grievances will be placed on your file along with a record of any decisions taken and any notes or other documents compiled during the grievance process.</p>
<p>If you have any difficulty at any stage of the grievance procedure because of a disability, you should discuss the situation with your manager or Human Resources as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Human Resources will always be available to advise managers and employees in the use of this procedure and to discuss particularly sensitive issues.</p>

This will enable the matter to be resolved swiftly and decisively. Only in exceptional circumstances will a grievance be considered after three months have elapsed since the incident occurred. Where appropriate, it is recommended that any complaints raised should use the informal stage of the grievance procedure, in the first instance. It should also be noted that if you do not observe the timescales without agreement, you may forfeit your right to proceed with your grievance.</p>\n<p>Every effort should made for parties to aim to resolve issues informally in the first instance.</p>\n<p>It is accepted that there may be instances where the nature of the grievance is too serious to be dealt with informally and it is necessary to undertake a formal investigation of the grievance. Formal proceedings may also be more appropriate where a previous attempt to find an informal resolution has been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that if Human Resources, a line manager or Trade Union Representative are made aware of a situation which has (or could cause) harm to the complainant (or others), the matter must be reported to HR and action will be taken immediately, potentially bypassing the informal stage.</p>\n<p>Throughout the informal and formal process, the respondent (where a respondent is identified) has the same right as the complainant to contact HR, line manager or Trade Union Representative for guidance and support.</p>\n<p>Please see Appendix 1 for a flowchart overview of the process.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The Informal Procedure</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In many cases issues may be resolved informally with no recourse to the formal procedure.</p>\n<p>The informal stage can apply where the complainant simply wants a behaviour to stop, there has been action which was deemed to be unfair or inappropriate, when there has been a deviation from a procedure which needs to be rectified or a potential risk has been identified.</p>\n<p>The informal stage aims to resolve issues by adopting a variety of approaches. This may include the complainant approaching and meeting the respondent/ person responsible for the area of concern (for example Head of Division/Department) to discuss the matter, accompanied with either a colleague, line manager (if appropriate) or a Trade Union Representative. Human Resources will facilitate and if required, attend the informal meeting. The aim of this meeting is to make clear to the respondent/person responsible for area of concern what action or behaviour the complainant finds unacceptable or of concern. It is hoped that both parties will suggest ways forward which are acceptable to both parties. If this informal approach is not suitable for the situation then mediation may be suggested as an alternative means of resolution.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Outcome One – Successful resolution</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>On occasion individuals may be unaware that their behaviour or an action is unwelcome and the informal meeting or mediation meeting may create an enhanced understanding of both parties points of view. This may lead to an agreement that either behaviour or actions will be modified. The individual may be comfortable to undertake this on their own or they may request support that is available from a variety of sources such as their line manager or HR Partner as well as the mediation and counselling services.

You can raise a grievance individually or as part of a group acting together. If you raise a grievance, it is normal for you to attend a meeting to give your side of events. If there is a Respondent named in your grievance they will be advised that a grievance has been raised and will receive a copy of the Written Grievance Form for information. Where any issue is already the subject of consultation or negotiation with trade unions or a grievance is being raised on behalf of two or more employees by a representative of a recognised trade union, this procedure is not appropriate and you should refer to the University’s Collective Grievance Procedure .</p>\n<p>HR will appoint an investigating officer from a list of staff members trained in undertaking investigations.

<p>Queen Margaret University recognises the fundamental importance of a harmonious working environment in the delivery of the University strategy and in support of its commitment to equality and respect for diversity. The University will ensure that all employees have access to a procedure to deal with any grievances relating to their employment or dignity at work complaint without unreasonable delay. We acknowledge that unresolved grievances are likely to affect the achievement and maintenance of satisfactory work standards. It is therefore in all our interests to resolve grievances as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The University recognises that practical steps must be taken to maintain and promote a good workplace environment. The grievance procedure enables all employees to raise any grievance relating to their employment. In addition to this, the dignity at work procedure has been developed to ensure that every employee understands their right to dignity and respect in the workplace, as well as their role in ensuring a respectful and inclusive workplace.</p>
<p>This procedure is designed to be pro-active and to encourage both positive behaviour and good workplace practices by supporting the creation of an environment which respects, nurtures, values and caters for difference amongst its employees.</p>
<p>In some circumstances it may be necessary that we are required to amend the procedure or vary it as appropriate to a particular case in the event that it is not reasonably practicable or otherwise inappropriate to follow the procedure set out below.</p>
<p>This procedure applies to all employees of Queen Margaret University regardless of length of service. Employees who wish to make a complaint about student behaviour or indeed a student who wishes to make a complaint about staff behaviour should refer to the Student Conduct, Complaints and Disciplinary Procedures or contact the Director of Academic Development and Student Affairs.</p>
