We are using this to elevate our focus on “place–based research” to ensure connectivity and coherence in research and innovation that is strategically integrated into the regional growth agenda. As part of this development, an Innovation Hub will facilitate an expansion of the University’s existing Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation and will provide flexible commercial space for small and medium sized businesses. The Innovation Hub is expected to act as a catalyst for the further development of an Innovation Park, based broadly around the theme of food and drink but with opportunities for health and wellbeing, on a 52 acre site close to the University campus. The Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal also promotes place based cohesion with regional Universities, including with the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Napier University to understand the potential of artificial intelligence and big data.</p>\n<p>Contact:<a href=\"mailto:rkedu@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Research and knowledge Email Address\">Research &amp; knowledge Email Address</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

<p>Our vision is to achieve an international research profile that ranks QMU as one of the leading post-92 universities in Scotland. Our Research and Knowledge Exchange (KE) is focused on improving quality of life and building the evidence base for policy and practice through world- leading interdisciplinary, translational research and external collaboration.</p>
<p>We work at the intersection of conventional disciplinary groupings to create innovative approaches to contemporary societal challenges and public discourse, and make a significant contribution to the creation and sharing of knowledge that reaches and influences a broad range of regional and international stakeholders. Our researchers benefit from different perspectives and interdisciplinary expertise that comes from being part of a community of researchers from across the University.</p>
<p>QMU is dedicated to building a supportive, considerate and highly motivated research culture based on diversity, inclusivity and mutual respect across all activities to help us to attract and retain our talented staff and students. Equality of opportunity is essential to achieving research excellence and we believe our diversity of thought and culture is fundamental to our ability to solve complex challenges. We aim to remove barriers, eliminate discrimination and make sure all researchers have the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>We offer researcher development training and mentoring; funded initiatives; interdisciplinary events; support for external collaboration; enterprise and innovation services; grant writing support; and career and professional resources to enhance employability, with opportunities to meet others and become part of our vibrant research community.</p>
