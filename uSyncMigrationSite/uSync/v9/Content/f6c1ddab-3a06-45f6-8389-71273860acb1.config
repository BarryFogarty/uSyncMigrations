    "content": "<p class=\"p1\">First-rate digital content has one primary quality; it makes us pause and want to look, to hear the message, to discover what happens next. Can the creation of such compelling material be a happy blend of good fortune and good timing. No it’s not: there is a method, and it can be mastered using skills learned on this practically focused course. By understanding the language of film you will learn how to improve content. Along with campaign strategy, you will learn engaging visual storytelling techniques (such as mise-en-scene, continuity and montage) that are essential for effective short documentaries, adverts or dramas. You will also learn key news-media production skills (such as interviewing, managing, producing, directing, shooting and editing short newsworthy film and other digital content).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drawing on QMU’s existing portfolio of courses in PR, film and media, this new course has been inspired by the professional experiences of our academic staff. Our media production lecturers have won a host of international awards for their short films and are highly successful on social media. Our PR and communications lecturers have professional and personal campaign experience and are involved with a range of campaigning organisations. This experience is at the centre of our teaching approach and we always engage students in producing real strategies and content for real clients. This results in campaigns where video and digital content have had a profound effect on audiences and have been crucial in achieving strategic aims and objectives.</p>"
