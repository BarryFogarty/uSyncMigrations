    "content": "<p>As a diagnostic radiographer you will be a healthcare professional who acquires and evaluates images of the human body to diagnose disease and trauma. You will use a range of high-technology imaging equipment and techniques and work closely with the multidisciplinary team to provide a person-centred service.</p>\n<p>Radiography is invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and trauma. As a diagnostic radiographer your skill, judgement and professionalism will be a vital part of a team’s clinical work, and affect patients’ lives, day after day. Awaiting a diagnosis can be a stressful time for patients and in this career you must be technically adept, an excellent communicator and provide person-centred care. This is why our diagnostic radiography programme places high importance on clinical placements. Placements are essential to build self-confidence, practice radiographic techniques and develop clinical knowledge in a real-life hospital setting.</p>\n<p>The Year One modules include anatomy and physiology, scientific and diagnostic technological radiographic principles. You will prepare for clinical practice by developing your communication skills and exploring the professional requirements of a diagnostic radiographer. To assist your transition into university there is a focus on academic skills including essay writing and how to access information. A two-week placement provides the opportunity to experience and integrate into the clinical environment.</p>\n<p>In Year Two you will undertake modules that explore more complex radiographic techniques including cross-sectional imaging and trauma. You will continue to broaden your understanding of health and well-being and how to influence behaviour change. Academic skills will be further developed by exploring the application of knowledge. You will develop your practical skills through 12 weeks of clinical placement.</p>\n<p>Year Three modules are designed to enhance your critical thinking and further develop your knowledge of specialist diagnostic imaging modalities. You will broaden your healthcare awareness and challenge your understanding of health education and promotion. You will continue to link theory and practice during 12 weeks of placement, which includes a four-week elective placement.</p>\n<p>Year Four provides the opportunity to enhance, consolidate and reflect on your theoretical, research, professional and clinical skills enabling a smooth transition to working life. You will explore leadership skills and innovative practice to meet current healthcare challenges. You will take ownership of your academic learning by undertaking a quality improvement project. This year includes 12 weeks of clinical placement.<br />We aim for all of our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member. This is the reason why we have implemented an interprofessional focus within all of our healthcare courses, including this one.</p>"
