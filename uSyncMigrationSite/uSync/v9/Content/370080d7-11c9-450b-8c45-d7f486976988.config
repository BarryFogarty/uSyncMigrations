Learners can obtain a Graduate Certificate (60 credits) in Year One or a Graduate Diploma (120 credits) in Year Two.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to study single modules in areas of interest. <a href=\"mailto:jchurchill@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Email Julie Churchill\"><strong>Contact Julie Churchill</strong></a> for further information.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>The Division of Nursing at QMU has developed and embedded a person-centred ethos in the teaching and learning strategies across all of its courses, drawing on the philosophical ideas of persons, personhood and person-centredness. This move from learner-centredness to person-centredness values the personhood of all persons equally, creating an environment where learners and teaching staff engage in mutual learning, with an approach which is facilitative and consistent.</p>\n<p>We create learning environments where all persons feel engaged and able to commit. Whilst most of the learning will take place in the workplace, delivery of the academic elements of this course will be entirely online with opportunities to engage regularly with the teaching team and other learners. Learners will be supported throughout the course by their Clinical Guide.</p>\n<p>A Clinical Guide is someone selected by the learner to support them through their learning journey. A Clinical Guide is someone who is encouraging and supportive, but who also provides honest and often candid feedback. Learners will agree an individual Learning Action Plan through tripartite discussion between themselves, their clinical guide and their personal academic tutor at QMU. This will allow learners flexibility to define the competencies and other learning activities needed to develop their own practice. Assessments will be discussed at the beginning of each specific module.</p>\n<p><strong>Work-based learning</strong></p>\n<p>Learners will complete the course in their substantive clinical post.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>A notional 160 hours in each academic year (equivalent to 3.5 hours a week) of protected learning time, towards this portfolio has been proposed for this course.</p>\n<p>These hours can be used as is best suited to each learner and their individual situation. Some of these hours will be used towards synchronous (live) sessions, spending time with colleagues within the Integrated Community Team, self-directed study and viewing recorded sessions.</p>\n<p>As this is an academic programme of study, learners will need to commit to self-directed learning in addition to these notional hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>"
