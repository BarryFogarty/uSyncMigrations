    "content": "<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The research programme on studying motor speech development in children using ultrasound tongue imaging was initiated by Dr Natalia Zharkova in 2008, in collaboration with Dr Nigel Hewlett and Prof William Hardcastle. This research led by Dr Zharkova has, over the years, attracted three grants from the <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/\" title=\"Economic and Social Research Council website\">Economic and Social Research Council </a>(~£577K fEC, in total).</p>\n<p>Typically developing children generally learn to produce most vowels and consonants correctly by the age of three years old. However details concerned with complex variations of speech sound production in words and sentences (or coarticulation) continue to develop during childhood. An example of coarticulation is the difference between two realisations of the consonant /s/, in the words \"sea\" and \"saw\", which arises from the influence of the following vowel. Understanding of coarticulatory processes and the constraints on them (for example the ability to differentiate between parts of the tongue) is fundamental to our knowledge of the general processes of speech motor control. Previous research by the team has demonstrated subtle developmental changes during childhood and preadolescent years. The new project is focussing on these subtle changes, by collecting and analysing ultrasound imaging data on tongue position and shape in speech.</p>\n<p><strong> Aims</strong></p>\n<p>The study aims to provide articulatory and acoustic data on the maturation of lingual coarticulatory patterns and tongue differentiation from the age of 3 years old to early adolescence. We will contribute to theories of speech production, focussing on the role of tongue constraints in coarticulation development. For the first time, the ability to differentiate between parts of the tongue will be systematically studied in tightly spaced age groups throughout childhood, using tongue imaging data. A long-term practical aim is to gain information that will potentially be useful for diagnosing speech motor problems. The database collected in the study will be a resource for addressing coarticulation development in children and other linguistic phonetic questions.</p>\n<p><strong> Research objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>to collect a database of lingual articulations by Scottish Standard English speakers aged between 3 and 13 years old, producing short sentences</li>\n<li>to validate the methodology of quantitative ultrasound analysis of lingual coarticulation based on recordings without head-to-transducer stabilisation</li>\n<li>to describe the development of coarticulation patterns in different consonants, from childhood to adolescence.</li>\n<li>to establish how articulatory constraints on the tongue affect consonant-specific coarticulation development in different age groups</li>\n<li>to describe the development of the ability to differentiate between parts of the tongue throughout childhood</li>\n<li>to produce an account of age-related changes in within-speaker variability in typical speakers</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p><strong>We have finished recruitment for this project. </strong></p>\n<p>Scottish-English speaking children aged between 3 and 13 years old participated in this ultrasound study of speech. The aim of this study is to investigate tongue movements during the pronunciation of some consonant-vowel sequences in speech, and to establish developmental trends in speech production from childhood to adolescence. During the recording, the child looks at the computer screen and reads or repeats short sentences, while the computer records images of the child's tongue via an ultrasound transducer placed below the chin.</p>\n<p>Up to five years old, children have the ultrasound transducer held under the chin by the investigator. Participants above five years old wear a special helmet, which holds the ultrasound transducer.</p>\n<p>Ultrasound is subject to rigorous safety assessments. There are no known risks associated with the technique and it is entirely non-invasive. Participants were native Scottish English speaking children without any speech or hearing disorders. The recordings took place at the ultrasound recording studio at Queen Margaret University.</p>\n<p>If you would like more information, please contact <a href=\"mailto:nzharkova@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Email Dr Zharkova\">Dr Natalia Zharkova</a>.</p>"
