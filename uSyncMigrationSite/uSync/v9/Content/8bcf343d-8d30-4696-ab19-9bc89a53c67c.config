      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>QMU’s ‘Walking Fit-ball' group is a weekly event that helps men over the age of 60, from the local community, meet up and play a more accessible version of football together with students from the University. </span> </p>
<p><span>While an element of competitivity remains, the ultimate goal of ‘Walking Fit-ball' is to help older men, as well as students, who may suffer from loneliness and isolation, develop a sense of community and connection.</span> </p>
<p><span>Elaine Stewart, Manager of Prostate Scotland's COMPASS project, came along to this week's game to see the ‘Fitball’ game in action and to chat and provide helpful information about prostate health issues to the men in the group. </span> </p>
<p><span>Elaine has been working on the Prostate FFIT project, at Tynecastle, a 12-week exercise and healthy living project for men with prostate cancer. She was keen to see how the charity can use initiatives like QMU’s 'Walking Fit-ball’ to share, what could be, life saving information and help keep men active once they have finished the Prostate FFIT programme.</span> </p>
<p><span>Elaine said: "Since our Prostate FFIT programme only runs for a short time, we are keen to identify what other opportunities men have to stay healthy once they have completed it. </span> </p>
<p><span>“Walking football is often a favourite sport among older men, so QMU’s group seems like a perfect fit for men in the East Lothian area.</span> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Prostate cancer typically affects older men so it is crucial to target those most likely to develop prostate issues for support and information. However, this support is equally relevant to younger men. These health conditions will become increasingly relevant in older age, but those with relatives suffering from prostate cancer are at an increased risk of developing it themselves." source="Elaine Stewart" sourceExtra="" />
<p><span>QMU academic, Dr Christos Theodorakopoulos said: “The ‘Walking Fit-ball' project has been successful, and we are proud of the strong community of regular players that come along to spend time with one another each week.</span> </p>
<p>"We were absolutely delighted to welcome Elaine to this week's game. Increased awareness of this serious health issue is crucial for improving the outcomes of those diagnosed with prostate cancer. Being aware of the warning signs and taking steps to get checked when you identify them, and ideally even before symptoms present themselves, can help catch cancer early and give people the best possible chance to beat it.</p>
<p><span>“So many men will suffer from prostate cancer or other prostate issues in their life. We hope that projects like this will get more men to actively pay attention to their own health.” </span> </p>
<p><span>Prostate Scotland is Scotland’s prostate disease charity. Its</span> <span>work provides men with information and help on prostate health, diseas</span><span>es and treatment. The organisation’s </span><span>website has a wealth of resources for men worried about prostate cancer and their families. </span> </p>
<p><span>According to Prostate Scotland, one in two men over 50 will be affected by a prostate disease at some stage of his life and one in ten will develop prostate cancer. The support offered by Prostate Scotland gives men crucial access to information on the warning signs of prostate issues and support once they are diagnosed.</span> </p>]]></Value>
