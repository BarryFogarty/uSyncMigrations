      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The BA International Hospitality, Tourism and Events Management programme that is offered through the QMU and ITM IHM partnership is a franchise programme, and as such QMU provides all teaching, learning and assessment materials, access to online learning resources, including a virtual learning environment, staff support, development and quality assurance, including the moderation of all assessments.  ITM IHM are responsible for providing all the necessary facilities to ensure that students have a suitable environment for learning, all teaching, learning and assessment activities in the classroom, as well as providing student support, and effective programme management. ITM IHM also work exceptionally hard to ensure that students are afforded a wide range of extra-curricular and co-curricular activities that positively enhance the student experience and provide valuable opportunities for students to apply and extend their learning in a positive and supportive environment.  In this way students are encouraged to recognise and value the knowledge and skills they are developing, and are enabled to enter the workforce with confidence in their abilities.</p>
<p>The programme is informed by the principles of responsible, ethical and sustainable business that underpin the work of Queen Margaret Business School. This programme seeks to facilitate the development of employment-ready graduates, who can lead and manage sustainable organisations in a turbulent environment and shape a better world, locally and globally. This commitment to ensuring that our graduates are well prepared to enter the workplace and make a positive contribution from the outset, has prompted us to make some changes to the programme, most notably through the inclusion of the “Project Managing a Live Event” module, designed to offer students an opportunity to hone their practical skills and thereby significantly enhance students’ enjoyment of the programme, as well as formalise our focus on graduate employability.</p>]]></Value>
