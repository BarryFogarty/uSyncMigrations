      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Shannon, aged 20 from Stoneyburn, West Lothian, was delighted to be awarded a £1000 bursary from the Ryder Cup Europe.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Ryder Cup Europe made a commitment to QMU to fund five tourism, hospitality and event student bursaries per year for a total of four years. The bursary scheme, now in its third year of distribution, means that a total of twenty QMU students will benefit by receiving £1000 each.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Shannon was delighted to win the financial support from the Ryder Cup which is to be used to help finance her daily travel from her home in West Lothian to the University.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">She said: “I’m absolutely delighted with this award. I based my application for the award on an event that I worked on the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisation (SCVO). I volunteered to assist with the event management of ‘The Gathering’ – SCVO’s showcase charity event in Glasgow, which was held this summer and attracted over 3000 people. The experience helped me gain hands-on work experience in event management and helped confirm that I really did want to pursue a career in the events industry.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Shannon continued: “This bursary will really help to alleviate the financial burden of student life. Before receiving The Ryder Cup Bursary, I juggled studying at Queen Margaret University with working four days in a restaurant. I have now been able to reduce my restaurant work to two days which is allowing me more time to focus on my studies.</p>
<p>“It’s important that I get the best marks I can during my 2nd year on the BA (Hons) Events Management”, said Shannon. “My aim is to study abroad during my third year, but I need top marks in order to do that.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Joe Goldblatt, said: “The 2014 Ryder Cup has created lasting benefits across Scotland and the bursary scheme is an important element of its education legacy. We are delighted that Queen Margaret University students are benefitting in this way. The financial benefits associated with this Scholarship help students concentrate on their studies and helps reduce stress during the learner journey.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The Ryder Cup Bursary Scheme runs at Queen Margaret University, as well as Perth College, University of the Highlands and Islands and the University of Stirling. The Scheme completes a range of educational commitments made by Ryder Cup Europe, covering primary through to further education initiatives.</p>]]></Value>
