      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Mature student, Mary Kelly, came to QMU in third year on the BA (Hons) International Hospitality and Tourism Management as a Direct Entrant student after completing a HND at City of Glasgow College. She began her HND after retiring from the police force having served for 30 years as a firearms officer.</p>
<p>Mary was presented with the Dr Norman Springford Future Leader Award on Wednesday 6 November after delivering an impressive presentation to Apex’s senior management team on the need for the hospitality industry to have a multi-skilled workforce. Mary will receive the award as a £3k bursary to support her during her final year of study.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Mary also received a £1,000 Apex Hotels Scholarship and completed an 11-week internship working in numerous departments such as housekeeping, food and beverage, reception and head office to gain experience in sales, events, and marketing.  Having made a very positive impression on hotel management while on her internship, Mary was subsequently offered a part-time role at Apex City of Glasgow Hotel.</p>
<p>Commenting on her award success, Mary said: “Receiving the Norman Springford Future Leader Award will show prospective employers the passion and commitment I have for my second career in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>“I hope to move onto a role in management as soon as I complete my degree.”</p>
<p>Taking great delight in presenting with her award, Dr Norman Springford, the founder and former executive chairman of Apex Hotels and honorary graduate of QMU, said: “It’s a real pleasure to present this award to Mary today. We were so impressed with her presentation, and her passion for the hospitality industry is clear to see.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to continue supporting students at Queen Margaret University to enhance the student experience and boost employability prospects after graduation.”</p>
