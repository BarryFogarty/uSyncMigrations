Whether you intend to be a theatre maker, scholar or teacher, the course will guide you in the development of your creative and critical prowess while providing very distinct routes into the professional world. By the time you graduate you will know how and why a theatre team brings a performance to life, and the many ways in which drama can be understood and made relevant to contemporary audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn the collaborative skills and process involved in creating and staging plays;</li>\n<li>experiment with key contemporary performance practices;</li>\n<li>explore all aspects of theatre, front and backstage, including the audience. Who are they? What do they want from a performance? How can you reach your audience?;</li>\n<li>challenge conventional assumptions of what the performing arts can be and who they are for, from both a practitioner and audience perspective; and</li>\n<li>engage with a vibrant diversity of practical and theoretical approaches that balance practice, history, research, critical thinking and employability skills.</li>\n</ul>"

There is a strong focus on group work and on independent study outside timetabled sessions. You will be assessed in a variety of ways, including essays, reports, portfolios, vivas, performances, post-show discussions and exams. You will complete a Year Four Honours project (practical or theoretical). There will be individual and group assessments.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>\n<p>Our fully resourced studio theatre and smaller black box studio are fully kitted out with sound, lighting, and projection equipment for your use. In addition we have a scenic workshop for building sets and props, a scenography studio for set design, and a costume studio and store.

Placements are usually in the creative sector but we will consider other options suggested by students if we feel they offer an opportunity for you to develop your practical skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>Studying abroad through our exchange programme can be one of the most exciting and rewarding challenges for a student to experience. The opportunity to travel and live in another country, learn different customs and traditions, meet new people and future career draws many students into the exchange programme. In Year Three you have the opportunity (subject to availability) to study for one semester at a university overseas. Please visit the <a href=\"/study-here/international-students/exchanges-and-study-abroad/\">Exchanges and Study Abroad</a> pages for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
