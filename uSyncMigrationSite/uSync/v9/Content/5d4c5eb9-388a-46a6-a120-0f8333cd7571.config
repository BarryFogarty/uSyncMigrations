To have a successful career in the theatre, you need to understand its historical context, techniques and craft. Whether you intend to be a theatre maker, scholar or teacher, the course will guide you in the development of your creative and critical prowess while providing very distinct routes into the professional world. By the time you graduate you will know how and why a theatre team brings a performance to life, and the many ways in which drama can be understood and made relevant to contemporary audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn the collaborative skills and process involved in creating and staging plays;</li>\n<li>experiment with key contemporary performance practices;</li>\n<li>explore all aspects of theatre, front and backstage, including the audience. Who are they? What do they want from a performance? How can you reach your audience? We challenge conventional assumptions of what the performing arts can be and who they are for, from both a practitioner and audience perspective; and</li>\n<li>engage with a vibrant diversity of practical and theoretical approaches that balance practice, history, research, critical thinking and employability skills.</li>\n</ul>"
