      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">1.0 - Policy Principles</span></p>
<p>The health of our staff is directly related to the vitality and well-being of the University. QMU recognises that high levels of attendance are essential in enabling the organisation to meet its objectives. The University also recognises that low levels of attendance, due to sickness absence, can have an adverse affect on morale and motivation and the health of those members of staff covering the work of absent colleagues. <br /><br />QMU is committed to encouraging and supporting regular attendance at work and to supporting and assisting members of staff in maintaining good levels of attendance. QMU also recognises its statutory obligations to members of staff in relation to disability discrimination and complies with all relevant legislation. Specific provisions may apply to the reporting of accidents at work. <br /><br />QMU recognises the importance of our staff’s cooperation and commitment in achieving consistently low levels of sickness absence and in minimising unplanned and unauthorised absence. This policy and supporting procedures provide a framework for ensuring the University is able to continue to operate effectively and to provide support for members of staff who are unable to attend work due to sickness absence. <br /><br />In order to manage attendance effectively there is a need to monitor all absence levels including individual patterns of absence. Monitoring enables a fair and consistent approach where a review of attendance identifies a pattern of absence that requires management intervention.<br /> </p>
<p><span class="lead">Aims and Objectives  </span></p>
<p>The aims of this policy are to: <br /><br />(a) ensure all members of staff are aware of and understand QMU’s policies and procedures for managing sickness absence <br /><br />(b) provide Deans of School and Heads of Department with a structured framework that supports them in managing sickness absence <br /><br />(c) provide positive means of support for members of staff to help them overcome any health or related concerns that are preventing them from attending work <br /><br />(d) allow Schools and Departments to maintain a high quality of service internally and externally <br /><br />(e) ensure all members of staff are treated fairly and consistently </p>
<p><span class="lead">Scope of the Policy </span></p>
<p>This policy applies to all members of staff of Queen Margaret University.</p>
<p><span class="lead">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) </span></p>
<p>All information gathered on individuals as part of the Sickness Management Policy will be processed in accordance with the Worker Privacy Notice. This includes the processing of sensitive personal data. The University has a documents retention schedule and all records and files in relation to the Sickness Management Policy are managed in accordance with that schedule. <br /><br /><span class="lead">Induction  </span></p>
<p>An explanation of all QMU policies should be given by the Line Manager or nominated person to all new members of staff to ensure they engage fully with the policy and processes at an early stage.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Learning and Development </span></p>
<p>Human Resources will provide Learning and Development for all members of staff involved in the implementation and application of this policy. The aim of this learning and development is to provide awareness of University policy and best practice, the legislative framework, including equal opportunities and to provide enhanced skills in managing and participating in the implementation and application of this policy.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Monitoring and Review  </span></p>
<p>Human Resources are responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of this policy and supporting procedures and will conduct an annual review. <br /><br />Anyone who feels they have been unfairly treated or discriminated against as part of the sickness management process should submit a written complaint to the Director of Human Resources.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Equal Opportunities</span> <br /><br />The University is committed to equality of opportunity for all members of staff and it is the responsibility of all QMU employees to promote equality and diversity in the application of this policy. The University is committed to ensuring there is no discrimination in the application of this policy on the grounds of disability, race, ethnic origin, sex/gender, age, religion, marital or family status, dependency, sexual orientation or because of membership of a trade union or similar association.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Responsibility for this Policy</span> <br /><br />Human Resources. Any changes to this policy and supporting procedures will be made in consultation with managers, staff and trade unions as appropriate.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Disclaimer </span><br /><br />QMU will update HR Policies in line with new or updated Employment Legislation. <br /><br /><span class="lead">2.0 - Sickness Management Policy </span><br /><br /><span class="lead"> Occupational Health and Safety </span></p>
<ul>
<li> QMU provides an occupational health service to support the development of the health and well being of all members of staff and to provide a systematic and planned approach to occupational health. </li>
<li>As part of the management of sickness, the University may wish to obtain a health assessment from our occupational health physician. The decision to seek the opinion of an occupational physician will be taken in the light of concerns the Dean of School/Head of Department has regarding the members of staff’s state of health and/or if the member of staff has lengthy absences or suffers frequent sickness absence.</li>
<li>The occupational health physician’s report will support discussions between the Dean of School/Head of Department, member of staff and Human Resources on the members of staff’s fitness for work and ability to carry out their duties. If a member of staff refuses to give their consent to attending an assessment or obtaining a report from our occupational health physicians, decisions about the member of staff will need to be made without the benefit of medical evidence.</li>
<li>The University reserves the right to require a member of staff to attend an appointment with our occupational health physician where it considers occupational health advice or an examination, is necessary in order to fulfil its duty of care to members of staff under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and associated legislation.</li>
<li>QMU recognises its responsibilities as an employer for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of all staff. The University through its Health and Safety Policy Statement and supporting policies and procedures takes all reasonable steps to provide a working environment without avoidable risk to members of staff, students and anyone who accesses our premises. For more information on our Health and Safety Policy and supporting procedures click on the intranet link http://intraserv/sites/humresources/healthsafety/default.aspx.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Employee Counselling Service </span></p>
<ul>
<li>As part of our policy of supporting occupational health, QMU provides an Employee Counselling Service. This is an independent, confidential service available to all members of staff and offers professional counselling for a wide range of personal issues. <br /> </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Monitoring Sickness Levels</span></p>
<ul>
<li> In order to respond to unacceptable levels of sickness absence it is important to establish arrangements for monitoring the level, pattern and trends of sickness absence, e.g. on an individual, School/Department, or university wide basis. Such arrangements will enable the identification of problem areas and provide a reliable basis for action should it be required.</li>
<li>The collation of relevant information may include an examination of appropriate documentation, contact with external sources and personal contact with individual members of staff. In relation to individual members of staff, information will be processed, communicated and acted upon in a confidential manner, recognising statutory requirements relating to data protection and/or legislation relating to access to medical records.</li>
<li>Human Resources will provide monthly reports on sickness absence levels, patterns and sickness absence trends to Deans of School/Heads of Department.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Procedures for managing sickness</span></p>
<ul>
<li>To support the fair and consistent application of this policy, QMU has comprehensive Sickness Management Procedures that are reviewed regularly by Human Resources.</li>
<li>Our procedures for managing sickness absence seek to establish a fair and consistent approach taking into account both the interests of individual members of staff and the organisational needs of the University.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Responsibilities </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Deans of School/Heads of Department and managers are responsible for the management of sickness within their area of responsibility. Managers are also responsible for communicating the provisions of this policy to all members of staff and ensuring compliance with the procedures. Individual members of staff are responsible for notifying sickness absence and completing the relevant QMU process for the reporting of sickness absence and providing medical certificates. New members of staff will be provided with information on this policy and associated procedures as part of their induction process.</li>
<li>Deans of School and Heads of Department are also responsible for ensuring their managers are fully aware of their role and responsibilities in the management of sickness absence. Human Resources will provide managers with information on sickness absence on a monthly basis. Support and guidance are available from Human Resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Implementation of the Policy </span></p>
<ul>
<li> Deans of School/Heads of Department and managers are responsible for maximising attendance in the areas under their control. Recording of all  <br />sickness absence is essential in ensuring QMU’s records are fully up to date and information is submitted to Human Resources in accordance with our Sickness Management Procedures.</li>
<li>Local monitoring and appropriate action should be undertaken by Deans of School and Department Heads in a consistent manner in accordance with this policy and supporting procedures. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li>
