      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Queen Margaret University (QMU), Edinburgh, has joined forces with the University of Bradford and a range of other partners, as part of a significant study to help cut hospital admissions.</p>
<p>Professor Brendan McCormack, Head of the Division of Nursing at QMU, is a collaborator and co-leader on key parts of the study. With 24 years of specialist experience in the nursing of older people, Professor McCormack is considered an internationally-renowned authority on person-centred nursing and practice development.</p>
<p>The three year project, beginning in March this year , will develop and test an intervention to reduce avoidable hospital admissions from care homes.</p>
<p>The study is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the intervention builds on Professor McCormack’s earlier research and will see the team of university researchers collaborate with primary and secondary care clinicians, nursing home staff and family members to develop clinical guidance and decision support systems for UK nursing homes.</p>
<p>The study group will also determine the best methods to improve the skills of nursing home staff and clarify the role of family members .  The grant will also enable the researchers to design the implementation support and guidance for the intervention .</p>
<p>Commenting on QMU’s involvement in this new study, Professor McCormack, said: “It’s a great opportunity to be a part of this research, as it has the potential to have significant benefit for older people residing in nursing homes and their families. </p>
<p>“The acute care sector is under constant strain and we know that the health of older people is not always enhanced through admission to hospital, so anything that can be done for older people in nursing homes to avoid unnecessary admission to hospital is a good thing.”</p>]]></Value>
