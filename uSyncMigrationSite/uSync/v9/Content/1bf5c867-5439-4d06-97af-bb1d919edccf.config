      <Value><![CDATA[<p> IIHD is involved through the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Network (MHPSS.net), QMU's online facility which promotes better mental health and community support in humanitarian emergencies.</p>
<p>MHPSS.net has set up a Nepal 2015 Earthquake Response Group to allow people and organisations to share resources, build knowledge and develop the skills required to respond to the impact of conflict, disaster and chronic adversity. Individuals and families suffer enormous emotional and social consequences, as well as material ones, from exposure to such large scale disasters.</p>
<p>In the hours and days immediately after a disaster many people are disorientated, confused and quick to panic. MHPSS.net has already made available 'Psychological First Aid' materials in Nepali to enable local professionals and international aid workers to protect, bring comfort and stability to people in the middle of the earthquake affected area. Over time, communities in Nepal will gradually learn of the extent of their losses, endure multiple bereavements and disruption. They will need to reshape their emotional and social - as well as material - worlds in order to restore their lives.</p>
<p>"As well as practical assistance to provide food and shelter for those who have either lost their homes, or are too afraid to go back to them, the importance of psychosocial support that help survivors to cope and rebuild their communities should not be underestimated,' said Dr Alison Strang of IIHD. "The MHPSS network allows those with expertise in humanitarian disasters and emergencies to immediately share what they have learned in very specific circumstances for the benefit of those providing emergency response on the ground in Nepal."</p>
<p>By building a global community of practice amongst mental health and psychosocial support professionals, MHPSS.net strengthens local community resilience. Already locals and international humanitarian practitioners are members of the network, and are using the online facility to be in touch and work together to help those affected by this disaster.</p>
<p>MHPSS.net was able to play a central role in supporting the response to the Typhoon Haiyan response in the Philippines. Now, through MHPSS.net, Filipino professionals are providing direct advice and support to colleagues in Nepal.</p>]]></Value>
