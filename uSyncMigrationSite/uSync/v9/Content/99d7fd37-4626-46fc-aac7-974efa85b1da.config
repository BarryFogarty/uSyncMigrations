At Queen Margaret University we want our students to be part of this experience too.</p>\n<p>With great links across the world, you can choose to study part of your degree in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada or the USA. Living in another country and studying with another institution will allow you to meet new friends from across the world and acquire invaluable life skills as well as a greater feeling of independence and confidence. Not only does an exchange program allow you stretch your wings, it will bring you benefits for years to come. Employers are impressed with students who take on the challenge, and a higher level of cultural awareness is considered an important factor when hiring employees, particularly for a global role. You may also learn another language, which is always a good addition to a CV.
