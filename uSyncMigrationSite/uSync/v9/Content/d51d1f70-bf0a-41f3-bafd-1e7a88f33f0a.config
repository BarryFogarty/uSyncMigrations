A significant proportion of the information we hold on alumni and stakeholders is that which is provided to us (for example you may give us information face to face, filling in forms on the University’s website, or by corresponding with us by telephone, email or otherwise). If you are a graduate of the University (or any of its predecessor or partner institutions) some of your personal data is transferred from your student record to the University’s alumni database.</p>\n<p>Most records contain:</p>\n<p>- Details of your education (e.g. the course you have completed and the dates of study).</p>\n<p>- Unique personal identifiers and biographical information (e.g. student number, date of<br />birth).</p>\n<p>- Your contact details which we update whenever you let us know they have changed.</p>\n<p>- Details of your interactions with the University, including:<br />(1) your membership of clubs, societies and alumni groups<br />(2) your attendance at University events<br />(3) communication you have received from the University or that the University has received from you<br />(4) details of any meetings that have taken place between you and the University</p>\n<p>- Your employment information.</p>\n<p>- Any history of donations to the University (please note we do not store full credit card details once the transaction has been processed).The original paperwork detailing bank account details are kept in a locked cupboard within Finance. The bank information is transferred on to our BACS system for direct debit collections. This system has restricted staff access.<br />We may also use information from publicly available sources, such as public LinkedIn profiles to gain up-to-date information about you, to carry out research to assess your inclination and capacity to support the University financially or by volunteering your time. We may use trusted third-party partners, such as Live Alumni, to carry out this type of data collection to automate some of this work. This information is in the public domain and includes details related to corporate business position, industry and location.</p>\n<p>Any sensitive personal data (i.e. data relating to physical disabilities) will only be held if it has been provided by you for a specific purpose (e.g. event planning).</p>\n<p>This data is held on a CRM database which is hosted by Blackbaud Inc. located in their European data centre. Access to personal data is restricted to those members of staff who have a requirement to maintain a relationship with you, and is controlled through password protection and user security profiles. All University employees, contractors and volunteers that are given access to personal data receive Data Protection training and have a contractual responsibility to maintain confidentiality.</p>"

It outlines the types of data that we hold and how we use them to provide services to our alumni and supporters. We aim to be clear when we collect your personal information, and not do anything you would not reasonably expect.</p>]]></Value>
