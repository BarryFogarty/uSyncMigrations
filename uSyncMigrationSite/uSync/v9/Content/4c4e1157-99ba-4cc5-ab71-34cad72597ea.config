      <Value><![CDATA[<p>As part of the Landmark Trust’s annual Landmark Futures scheme, the group of MA Arts, Festival and Cultural Management students spent a week in the surroundings of a fisherman’s cottage built in the 1840s: The Shore Cottages No2.</p>
<p><span>The visit was part of the Arts Management in Practice module, which allowed students to explore rural Scottish cultural organisations; including visits to Timespan, Northlands Creative and local studios. They experienced creativity taking place outside of urban contexts and examined the realities of how to manage these organisations, giving them a fuller understanding of the field.</span></p>
<p><span>In Berridale near Wick, Caithness, The Shore Cottages No2 made a special place for the free break – situated directly on the beach overlooking a beautiful cove known as The Shore, the cottage is reached by a footbridge. </span></p>
<p><span>The peaceful, isolated bay is sheltered by high rocky cliffs and is a favourite of birds and seals. The Landmark Trust rescues historic buildings at risk, such as The Shore Cottages, giving them a future by letting them for self-catering stays.</span></p>
<p><span>QMU student, Jessica Cowley, said: “The trip offered me an extremely valuable learning experience. My previous research into arts organisations has been city-based, so this trip gave me the perfect opportunity to explore how to run an arts organisation within a rural setting. It gave me an excellent understanding of what it is like to live and work in rural areas, and offered the chance to compare rural and city-based arts organisations.</span></p>
<p><span>“I truly appreciate the time and effort that went into securing the donation from The Landmark Trust. It made the trip accessible to all students, no matter what their personal income is.”</span></p>
<p><span>Commenting on her experience, Sarah Tegeler, said: “Without this trip, we couldn’t have experienced how artists and arts organisations in rural contexts work. The trip has helped us understand the challenges and opportunities of the arts sector as a whole.”</span></p>
<p><span>Fellow student, Sally Lamont, added: “The stay at The Shore Cottages exceeded all expectations. It enabled the group to experience the remoteness of a rural environment, visit rural arts organisations and gain knowledge about managing an arts and cultural organisation. I’d highly recommend this trip to any future students. I’m thankful to The Landmark Trust for the opportunities this trip allowed.”</span></p>
<p><span>Launched in autumn 2017, the Landmark Futures scheme is designed to enable ‘light bulb’ moments across a study field and for individual students. Applications are open to all higher education institutions and other qualifying organisations, and encouraged from all disciplines – with only 11 institutions successful in securing a free stay in this first year.</span></p>
<p><span>Caroline Stanford, Historian and Head of Engagement at Landmark and who conceived the Landmark Futures scheme, said: “People often tell us they find staying in a Landmark gives them a chance to step away from the distractions of daily life, with time to think, talk, write and be inspired. </span></p>
<p><span>“With the Landmark Futures scheme, we’re extending those benefits, free, to university research groups. The popularity of the scheme underlines the relevance of time spent in historic buildings in beautiful places for those whose work will shape and enrich everyone’s futures, and we’re delighted to be able to help in this way.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/" title="The Landmark Trust">T</a><span><a href="https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/" title="The Landmark Trust">he Landmark Trust</a> was founded in 1965 to preserve architecturally interesting and historic buildings at risk, giving them a future by letting them for self-catering stays. Today, 198 unique historic ‘Landmarks’ across Britain, Italy, France and Belgium are available for holidays at prices from £16 per person per night. </span></p>
<p><span>Each ‘landmark’ has a special place in the warp and weft of our national story; be it a part of the industrial revolution, a window onto significant social change, the spaces of brilliant writers or the work of notable architects.</span></p>
<p><span>The rental income pays for the buildings’ upkeep and survival in our culture, society and landscape, but the Trust relies on grants and voluntary sources of income to rescue further buildings at risk. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/get-involved/landmark-futures-2020/" title="Landmark Futures scheme">Landmark Futures</a> is an annual scheme offering free study stays in Landmark Trust buildings to higher education institutions or other qualifying organisations. Application for stays during the 2018/19 academic year will open in the autumn of 2018.</span></p>
