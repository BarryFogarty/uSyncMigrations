      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">About you:</span></p>
<p>Eimear is a 4th year student on the Master of Nursing (MNurse) course and comes from Donegal, in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study at Queen Margaret University (QMU)?</span></p>
<p>I chose to study at QMU because the University has a great reputation for nursing. As the course is four years, I will obtain my honours Nursing degree which will be good to build on when I want to move up the career ladder as I will have a strong academic background. This course was the route I wanted to go down professionally, and I believed that QMU fit with my character and who I am as a person.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What interested you about your chosen course?</span></p>
<p>The facilities here for my subject are second to none. Having small class groups which deliver effective learning is ideal for me as I struggle in larger groups. Having smaller classes also enables me to ask questions.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What attracted you to study in Edinburgh?</span></p>
<p>I was attracted to study in Edinburgh as it has excellent infrastructure and scenery. It is a beautiful city and the people are very friendly - it reminds me a lot of home which is a huge benefit.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">The Course</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been the highlight?</span></p>
<p>The highlight of this course for me has been seeing myself grow as a person and become the nurse that I always dreamt of being. I have made friends for life from my course in both classmates and in lecturers.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How have your lecturers supported your learning?</span></p>
<p>All the lecturers at QMU are extremely supportive towards your learning. They strive for you to do your best and they go above and beyond for you if you are having difficulty and struggling. They have drop-in sessions regularly and at the height of COVID-19 they were so supportive, always encouraging you to do your best. No problem is too big for them to help with.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What have been some of your challenges with the course and university life? How have you overcome them?</span></p>
<p>As with everything there are challenges that I have had to face while at University. The workload was a big step up from school and took some time to get used too but having supportive friends and lecturers helped. Having small classes also helped as well as smaller seminar groups for project work and learning.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Have you taken part in a placement as part of your course and if so, what was your experience?</strong></span></p>
<p>I have taken part in many placements as part of my course. It was daunting at the beginning but now, as a fourth year on my management placement, I feel grateful that I have had as many placements as I have, as I am very prepared. Every placement has been a great learning experience and the lecturers are incredibly supportive when we are out them as well.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in applying for this course?</span></p>
<p>My main piece of advice for students applying for the Nursing course at QMU is that it may seem scary now and if you are going to be moving away from home it’s even scarier but just take the leap and go for it. It’s the best thing I ever did, it’s made me the person I am today and I’ve met some amazing people along the way. I can’t recommend QMU enough for future Nursing students.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big"><strong>The Student Experience</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Are you a member of any clubs or societies at QMU? If so, what was the reason you joined and what do you enjoy most about it?</strong></span></p>
<p>I was a member of the QMU ladies Gaelic football team in my first and second year. It was a great way to meet new friends and blow off some steam from the University workload. It was also great fun and a way to see different parts of Scotland on away games.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>What is your ‘top tip’ for making the most of being a student?</strong></span></p>
<p>My ‘top tip’ for making the most out of being a student would be to make sure to have fun along the way and join a society, but to stay on top of your workload. Find a balance that works for you!</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>What has been the most valuable lesson that you have learned at university?</strong></span></p>
<p>To be yourself and have confidence in yourself and that you can’t be everyone’s friend.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big"><strong>After QMU</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>What are you plans after graduation? Tell us about your ambitions and where you see yourself in the future? </strong></span></p>
<p>I hope to be the best nurse I can be in the future and work my way up the professional ladder. I hope that I can do QMU and the</p>]]></Value>
