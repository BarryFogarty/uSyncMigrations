<p>The Court of Queen Margaret University is committed to this institution’s purpose of helping to create a better society through education, research and innovation, and providing a supportive and creative learning environment in which students and staff thrive. This commitment includes the effective management of health and safety within QMU.</p>
<p>The Court accepts its responsibilities as an employer for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of staff, students and others who may be affected, in respect of harm caused by fire in the workplace. This specific policy supports (and has the same force as) the current overarching Health and Safety Policy.</p>
<p>The Court recognises that effective and efficient fire safety management can contribute to organisational performance by eliminating or reducing unnecessary risks and liabilities. To facilitate this, the Court will create and promote a positive fire safety culture that secures the commitment and participation of all staff and students to help achieve, maintain, and develop high standards of fire safety on the Queen Margaret University campus.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Court shall:</p>
<p><span class="lead">Provide</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Premises which are constructed and maintained with fire safety measures (active and passive fire protection) of an appropriate standard.</li>
<li>Adequate means of escape.</li>
<li>Adequate means for fighting fire and for giving warning in the event of fire.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Ensure</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Appropriate procedures for serious and imminent danger from fire and for danger areas.</li>
<li>Provision of information to employees, contractors, and visitors to the University.</li>
<li>Appropriate training to employees.</li>
<li>The elimination or reduction of risks from dangerous substances.</li>
<li>The maintenance of measures provided for the protection of fire-fighters.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Undertake</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable and sufficient fire risk assessments of all University buildings to assess the risks to the occupants from fire and to implement and analyse the adequacy of fire safety measures.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">Periodically test, monitor, and audit all fire safety systems and procedures to ensure</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous and planned improvement.</li>
<li>The application of corrective and preventative actions based on monitoring, auditing and investigating activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Principal of the University, I am authorised to ensure that this policy is implemented effectively throughout the institution. The policy (and the associated approved Fire Safety Management document) applies to all persons, premises and activities falling, to any extent, under the University’s control, whether at home or abroad.</p>
<p>I call on your support in ensuring that this policy is implemented and adhered to as appropriate, helping to keep everyone safe. Thank you.</p>
<p>Principal and Vice-Chancellor, Sir Paul Grice.<br />December 2023.</p>]]></Value>

Its suite of buildings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main academic building [hosting library, research, teaching, and professional services activity].</li>\n<li>Sports complex/drama facility/QMU students’ union building.</li>\n<li>Energy Centre.</li>\n<li>Drama set construction.</li>\n<li>Groundkeeper facilities.</li>\n<li>Student residential accommodation [9 units, including management suite].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve effective fire safety management, it is essential to develop and maintain a strategy that links the active and passive fire safety systems throughout the QMU estate with the appropriate response (human behaviours) of all occupants to fire, fire alarm and evacuation.</p>\n<p>This policy outlines Queen Margaret University’s collective strategy in response to the hazard of fire within the campus.</p>"

    "title": "3. QMU Fire Risk Profile",
    "content": "<p>All premises occupied and operated by Queen Margaret University have undergone full fire risk assessment, as defined in the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006, by competent consultants. These assessments reflect, in part, the nature and use of the building, population types, fire safety measures (both passive and active protective measures) and the emergency evacuation and management procedures in place. Where weaknesses are identified by internal monitoring/audit/review process, action points/further control measures will be determined and completed to ensure the robustness of the QMU community’s collective response to fire.</p>\n<p>QMU Campus is purpose-built and incorporates, in part, the most recent advances in fire engineering technology/smoke modelling to ensure that occupants of the buildings can escape safely in the event of fire or fire alarm.</p>\n<p>The areas designated as the highest fire risk are typical in such educational establishments – catering facilities, laboratories, sleeping risk, etc. and the activities surrounding the use of third-party contractors. The QMU energy centre facility (a remote distinct building on the campus) supplies heat to campus buildings and thus fire risk from this source is absent from many campus structures.</p>\n<p>The Campus is a ‘no smoking’ zone with a designated smoke shelter in place.</p>\n<p>Fire risk from electrical malfunction is addressed through full compliance with the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 by the operation of a regular portable appliance testing regime alongside periodic fixed wire electrical installation inspection and testing.</p>\n<p>Queen Margaret University’s risk profile also extends beyond person and asset safety to business resilience. The Main Building facility incorporates most of the corporate and academic functions of the University and a catastrophic loss of this facility due to fire has the potential to effectively reduce the ability of Queen Margaret University to discharge its obligations. To reflect the importance of this risk exposure, business resilience/continuity now features within this policy document and guidance note.</p>\n<p>It is essential that the QMU community, collectively, aspires to the highest standards of fire safety to protect both the people and as a place of research and learning.</p>"

    "content": "<p>The QMU Campus comprises a portfolio of buildings built to modern building standards. The main academic building, due to its complex architectural design, incorporates advanced fire engineering to control the flow of smoke from fire within the atrium area and throughout the building. This control system was detailed in the original building specification and became a condition of build and, as a consequence, any deviation/modification in building use or structure can only be sanctioned with permission from the local planning/building and fire authorities.</p>\n<p>To support the advanced nature of these operational active and passive fire control measures is a fire strategy, partly outlined in this policy and supplemented by an authorised Fire Safety Management document. This document describes in detail the way the University community will manage a fire event and evacuation, taking into account vulnerable persons and visitors/contractors in QMU buildings.</p>\n<p>Completing the overall strategy is a comprehensive suite of fire risk assessments that detail the overall fire assessment rating, survey findings and analysis and remedial actions to ensure that Queen Margaret University is an organisation fully aware and ready to respond appropriately to a fire event or emergency evacuation. These fire risk assessments (and Campus buildings) are regularly audited by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.</p>"
