    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p align="LEFT"><strong>For the year ended 31 July 2023</strong></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The pace of change in the world shows no sign of letting up – demographic shifts, geo-political <br />tensions, advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the climate crisis, inflation and fiscal belt-tightening <br />are all having a real and present impact on people and institutions. As with all universities, we are <br />having to manage substantial real terms reductions in funding from government, and greatly <br />increased costs arising from inflation, including staff pay costs. A specific consideration for the<br />University is the scheduled renewal of our long term borrowings, required by December 2024, a <br />matter for consideration in Management’s assessment of Going Concern. The reality is that across <br />Scotland and the rest of the UK, universities are having to make some difficult financial decisions <br />arising from this very challenging financial environment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our student numbers continue to increase, though not in the expected pattern. Although high <br />employment and inflation has dampened the market for home students, demand from international <br />markets has been high, bringing new opportunities, while we continue to protect our home markets.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We have successfully launched QMU Online, our suite of postgraduate online courses offering <br />students a step on and off ‘carousel’ model of learning. Our work in this form of delivery is setting <br />us up well for a future in which quality of digital delivery is of greater importance than ever before, <br />and with students increasingly seeking more flexible ways of participating in higher education.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We have also expanded our range of transnational education partnerships in this last year, with <br />more than a third of our students now studying with us through such partnerships. Our involvement <br />in this type of educational provision extends over nearly two decades now. Along with fostering an <br />international perspective, this has supported efforts to grow and diversify our income.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">More broadly, analysis shows that despite the fluid and rapidly changing policy and financial <br />environment, our underlying business model continues to provide the opportunity to grow income <br />further. To enable this and ensure we continue to achieve our strategic ambitions we are <br />considering measures we could take to understand, and where identified, make our current <br />operating model more effective</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Alongside focusing on growth, we continue to work hard to optimise the experience of our existing <br />and future students. Central to this is our Learning Enhancement and Academic Development<br />(LEAD) centre, established two years ago. One of LEAD’s innovations is employing a team of<br />‘Student Champions’ - paid, part-time roles - to work collaboratively with students and staff in the <br />co-creation of initiatives associated with our Student Experience Strategy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the National Student Survey 2023, several of our courses achieved 100% overall satisfaction; <br />and our Students’ Union was ranked second top in Scotland, with students agreeing that QMUSU <br />represented students' academic interests well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We are one of the top five climbers in the Guardian University League table published this year, <br />and we have also moved up in the QS University World Rankings. Furthermore, our work <br />supporting student wellbeing has won accolades this last year, with our Thank Goodness It’s <br />Thursday (TGIT) initiative winning the Supporting Student Wellbeing category of the Herald Higher <br />Education Awards and being shortlisted in the Watusi? and CUBO awards.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This last year saw significant progress on the CityDeal funded Innovation Hub to be built on land <br />adjacent to our campus. A joint venture between QMU and East Lothian Council, the hub will be a <br />catalyst for economic development throughout the Edinburgh City Region,and provides <br />unprecedented opportunities for us to foster our innovation capabilities and an entrepreneurial <br />culture. The Hub has full planning permission, construction is due to begin at the end of this year <br />and the facility is scheduled to become operational in August 2025.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our focus on innovation was boosted this year with the launch of Start for Future at QMU. A <br />European wide project, SFF supports early-stage start-ups and entrepreneurial spirited individuals <br />looking to join a start-up in its early days. It provides members with expert coaching and start-up development, bringing together an alliance of European higher education institutions (HEIs), incubators, research and business development centres, start-ups, and industry partners.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Following REF 2021, work has already begun on REF 2028, and our research continues to make <br />a difference in the here and now. We supported Creative Scotland this year evaluating cultural <br />policy, with a particular focus on approaches to employment for freelance creative practitioners <br />engaging people in shaping the future cultural life of their local community. Another example is <br />the work of our speech scientists developing the use of ultrasound technology to help improve <br />early detection of swallowing issues associated with conditions like stroke, Motor Neurone Disease <br />(MND), Parkinson’s, and head and neck cancers. This could allow earlier medical interventions <br />and improved quality of patient care. Researchers in our Institute for Global Health and <br />Development, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, are making a significant contribution <br />to discussion on how we equitably share the inevitable harms from global heating across the world <br />protect the most vulnerable.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Those QMU staff involved in preparing for our 150th anniversary in 2025 have had the pleasure of <br />delving into the archives, finding out how this institution has played its part in national and <br />international moments of need and transformation, for example during the two world wars. In that <br />same spirit, we have this year been twinned with a university in central Ukraine as part of the UK-Ukraine Twinning Initiative, which is seeing UK universities twinning with a Ukrainian partner to <br />help provide immediate support, as well as longer term strategic engagement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So as we continue to deliver on our commitment to act as a force for good in the world, our <br />achievements in the last show that at QMU we have the drive, focus, and vision needed to ensure <br />that this University fulfils its potential for many years to come.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><br />Sir Paul Grice, FRSE, FAcSS<br />Principal and Vice-Chancellor<br />13 December 2023</p>]]></Value>
