Emphasis will be placed on integrating clinical and university-based learning opportunities and on independent study. Your performance will be assessed by a combination of assignments, examinations and practical assessments.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>The RCSLT curriculum guidance requires that, on completion of the course, all students have completed the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100 sessions (50 days) of practice-based learning under the supervision of a registered SLT. 30 sessions (15 days) of which must be with paediatric client groups and 30 sessions of which must be with adult client groups.</li>\n<li>50 sessions (25 days) of clinically-related activity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Placements are organised by the Clinical Placement Team. Semester placements are typically for one or two days per week and students will be placed across our local catchment area within the Health Boards of Lothian, Borders, Fife, Forth Valley and Tayside.</p>\n<p>Summer placements take place in both years of the course and students are typically placed across the whole of Scotland. Although every effort is made to arrange placements to suit students’ circumstances, this is not always possible and students must be prepared to be flexible about placement location and timing. Students are responsible for any travel and accommodation costs associated with their placements.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module will require you to attend classes and carry out independent work. Your attendance at placement is compulsory and your attendance at QMU-based modules is also expected.</p>\n<p>Classes may be spread over the whole week, except for placement days when you will be off campus. This is a full-time course, with the expectation that classes, independent study and placement together require 35-40 hours of dedicated time each week.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>We expect to have 25-35 students on the course each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>"
