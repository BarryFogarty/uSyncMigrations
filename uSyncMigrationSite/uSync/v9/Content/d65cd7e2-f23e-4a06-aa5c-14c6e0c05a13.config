The University reserves the right to amend published fees. </span></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Fee levels are reviewed on an annual basis, and are subject to increase.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If the fee for a particular course in which you are interested is not listed here, please contact Registry for advice. <a href=\"mailto:registry@qmu.ac.uk\" class=\"txtMainTextLinks\">registry@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">PAYMENT OF FEES (DUE DATE) </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Tuition fees become due on the first day of your programme of study. Arrangements for fee payments are detailed below.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">International students who have paid a £2000 deposit will have this amount deducted from their overall fees.</p>\n<p class=\"txtHeadings\"><strong>21 DAY PERIOD</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Within 21 days of the due date, all students must either pay their tuition fees in full, or have arranged with the Finance Office to pay by instalments. If you wish to pay in full, payments can be made via the <a href=\"https://u.qmu.ac.uk/live/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn\">student portal;</a> via debit card or credit card or with cash. Payments may be made in person at the Finance Office or by sending in a cheque made payable to QMU. Please put your matriculation number on the back of the cheque and sent it to the Finance Office, QMU, Queen Margaret University Drive, Musselburgh, East Lothian, EH21 6UU. You can also pay over the phone by calling +44 (0)131 474 0000 and asking for 'Finance.'</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">PAYMENT BY INSTALMENTS </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">You may choose to pay tuition fees by instalments, rather than by a single payment either by Direct Debit or Recurring Card Payment (RCP). These instalments are over 8 months, October to May for September starts or January to August (for January 2019 starts only).</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you choose to pay by Direct Debit you will find the form on the Student Portal (you must have a UK Bank Account for this to operate). Alternatively, you can set-up an RCP on the Student Portal whereby instalments are taken from your debit/credit card over 8 months (October to May or January to August for January 2019 starts only). For all returning students, you must renew your Direct Debit or RCP each year. For new students you will only get access to the Student Portal after you have completed online matriculation. <strong>Please note that short courses/low fee courses may not be paid by instalments</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">PAYMENT BY A SPONSOR </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">It is a condition of registration that students accept liability for their tuition fees. <em>Remember that even if your fees are to be paid by a sponsor, such as an embassy or employer, it is your personal responsibility to ensure that they are paid and to provide evidence of funding when you matriculate.</em> Where any student has failed to provide written confirmation of funding within 28 days of the start of their programme of study, she/he will be deemed to be personally liable for payment of the fees, and an invoice will be issued to the student accordingly. If your sponsor is a Health Board you must obtain a Purchase Order number from them so this can be quoted on an invoice.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">DISCOUNT</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">For all annual tuition fees of £9,000 and above, where the student is self-funding and the fee is settled in full by 31 October 2018, a discount of 5% will be authorised.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Graduates of the University who hold a verified QMU undergraduate or postgraduate award and who are admitted to a named postgraduate award of QMU from 2011/12 will be eligible for a 10% discount on the published fees.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">PART-TIME FEE GRANT</strong></p>\n<p>If you are over 16 and live in Scotland you may be eligible for a part-time fee grant which helps to cover the tuition fee cost of part-time study (but does not pay for all of it). In order to qualify you must be studying part-time, a minimum of 30 credits and have a personal income of less than £25,000 per annum.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.saas.gov.uk/part_time/ug/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">SAAS website to see how they would calculate their contribution towards you fees</a> - or contact <a href=\"mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk\">studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p>You must apply for the part-time fee grant <strong>no later</strong> than three months after the start date of your course.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><span class=\"txtHeadings\"><strong>PROFESSIONAL BODY REGISTRATION FEES </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Students will be personally liable for payment of any professional body registration fees as detailed in the Registration &amp; Membership fees sections.</p>\n<p class=\"txtHeadings\"><strong>INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS <span class=\"txtMainBlack\"></span></strong></p>\n<p>The University is pleased to offer a number of competitive Scholarships of between £3000-5000 for new International students undertaking their first year of study on UG or taught PG degrees.

The University will be sympathetic and assist where it can. However, in order to maintain the quality of teaching for everyone else, the University must act to recover debts. Initially you should approach Bill Stronach, the <a data-id=\"1642\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/ad8fc076737d4365941e1ad4c0445c77}\" title=\"Student Funding Service\">Student Funding Adviser </a>within Student Services for a confidential discussion.
