<ul>
<li><strong>We are smaller by design than many universities, so you will enjoy smaller class sizes and a close, supportive relationship with our academic team.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be part of a vibrant, supportive and social learning community that is integrated across all Physiotherapy year groups.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will benefit from a carefully considered balance of theory and practical learning. Extracurricular opportunities can further develop your physiotherapy skills.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this course you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to register with the HCPC and practise as a physiotherapist on graduation.</li>
<li>Be able to confidently deliver safe, effective and person-centred physiotherapy care on graduation.</li>
<li>Become part of a community of learners, working collaboratively with lecturers, clinical staff, service users and other students on a transformational journey towards registration.</li>
<li>Carry out invaluable practice-based placements in each year that will enrich your learning. Placements will take place in a variety of real health and social care settings and you will work (supported by a registered physiotherapist) with patients, their carers and families, and with other health and social care professionals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Physiotherapists are healthcare professionals who use person-centred approaches to make a difference to people’s lives. Physiotherapists work in a wide range of settings and focus on the management and prevention of problems relating to movement and function across the life-span.</p>
<p>Physiotherapy is a demanding course and we recommend that you research the career thoroughly and consider work shadowing before you come to QMU</p>
<p>This is a four year integrated undergraduate master’s course that leads to eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a physiotherapist. Students commence the course with a view to graduating with a Master of Physiotherapy (MPhys) in four years. Years Three and Four will include some study alongside postgraduate students studying on the MSc Physiotherapy (Pre-Registration) course. There is an option for students to choose a BSc (Hons) route at the end of Year Two and they will still be eligible to apply for registration with the HCPC as a physiotherapist.</p>]]></Value>

For some health boards  relocation for the duration of the placement might be required unless there are  individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location.
