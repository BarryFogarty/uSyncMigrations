<p><span>Having worked across four continents, Professor Reidpath has held academic and senior research positions at several prestigious institutions in Australia, </span><span>Malaysia, Bangladesh and the UK and has collaborated with </span><span>higher education institutions </span><span>and researchers all over the world. </span> </p>
<p><span>Over the years his work has principally focused on the measurement of population health, social stigma (particularly HIV related stigma) and health equity. He has a borderless approach to academic work and is passionate about increasing the research and impact of </span><span>collaborations that improve scientific capacity to meet the needs of the world's poor and marginalised.</span> </p>
<p><span>Prior to taking up his new position at the helm of QMU’s Institute for Global Health and Development in July this year, Professor Reidpath was Senior Director, Health Systems and Population Studies Division, at icddr,b Bangladesh. From 2011</span><span>‑</span><span>2019, he was the founding Director of the South East Asia Community Observatory at Monash University, Malaysia, and  Professor of Population Health at the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University, Malaysia.</span> </p>
<p><span>Working in the area of public health and global health since 1996, he has authored and co-authored multiple peer-reviewed scientific papers, presented works at many international conferences and held several honorary and advisory positions with educational and advisory organisations.</span> </p>
<p><span>Professor Fiona Coutts, Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Queen Margaret University, said: “We are delighted to welcome Professor Reidpath to the University. Having worked for a number of prominent universities, NGOs and organisations all over the world, Professor Reidpath has an impressive reputation as an influencer and leader in global health development. As a leading researcher, his interdisciplinary and innovative approach to research has shaped policy and helped implement positive change, thereby transforming lives in many countries throughout the world. His work in supporting the development of a healthier, fairer and more equal society which helps marginalised populations and builds capacity in poorer countries aligns with Queen Margaret University’s aim of shaping a better society through education, research and innovation.</span><span> </span> </p>
<p><span>“</span><span>Professor Reidpath will build on the great work achieved by our Institute for Global Health and Development under the leadership of Professor Alastair Ager, who has recently retired. We are excited to see the team going from strength to strength and building on the values of social justice and equality which underpins QMU’s world view.” </span><span> </span> </p>]]></Value>
