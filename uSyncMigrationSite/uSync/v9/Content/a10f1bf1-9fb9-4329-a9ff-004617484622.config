<li>Institutions without degree-awarding powers may want to offer their students a recognised academic qualification.</li>
<li>Institutions who do have degree-awarding powers in their own country may want to offer a joint or dual award that gives their students an international experience and is more easily transportable around the world.</li>
<li>Institutions may want to share their expertise with ours in order to deliver a degree that neither partner could fully support on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here at QMU we have been working with partners since the 1990s. Our earliest partnerships were with St Columba’s Hospice, local NHS trusts and private education providers in India and Greece. Over the years we have developed considerable expertise in supporting partner organisations and have well-established procedures for quality assurance and staff development.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviewing-higher-education/quality-assurance-reports/Queen-Margaret-University-Edinburgh" title="Quality Assurance Agency Scotland ELIR">Quality Assurance Agency</a> has included QMU’s collaborative provision in its reviews and concluded that QMU has "... an effective set of arrangements that meet sector expectations and are underpinned by robust policies and procedures, in particular programme approval, annual monitoring and review, and thorough processes for the quality assurance of assessment. Partnerships are well supported through Academic Link staff, the operation of Joint Boards of Study, a range of useful guidance and extensive development opportunities."</p>
<p>More information about the different ways in which we work with partners is set out below.</p>]]></Value>
