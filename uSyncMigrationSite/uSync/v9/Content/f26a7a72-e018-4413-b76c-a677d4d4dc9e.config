<p>By Isabell Hodgson, (Class of 1972)</p>
<p><span class="lead">OUR GROUP of 12 commenced studying the Institutional Management </span><span class="lead">Diploma in 1969. We were the last cohort to graduate with this award in </span><span class="lead">1972. Our first year was spent studying at Atholl Crescent, which was </span><span class="lead">the institution’s first base in Edinburgh. It was a wonderful place which was </span><span class="lead">steeped in history - if only the buildings could talk! We relocated to the new </span><span class="lead">college building in Clerwood Terrace, Edinburgh, for our last two years. It was a </span><span class="lead">total contrast to our first year, with the new site offering modern buildings and </span><span class="lead">equipment, as well as very comfortable halls of residences</span></p>
<p>Our course was very diverse, covering business management; accountancy; science; and cultural studies, the latter which included visits to art galleries. There were also practical subjects such as food and beverage management; domestic services (cleaning), which included a six-week programme cleaning our fellow students’ study rooms; and laundry and dressmaking, which included producing curtains and cushion covers! We also carried out work experience in different sectors of the hospitality industry – this was one of the best parts of the course. All of these experiences influenced the future careers of many of the group.</p>
<p>We’ve all kept in touch since graduation and have held several reunions throughout <br />the years. Our first reunion was held at the Fox Covert Hotel in Clerwood, Edinburgh, <br />where many happy and outrageous memories were shared. We have also enjoyed <br />gatherings at the QMU campus in Musselburgh, as well as reunions in both Edinburgh <br />and York (with many of our group based in the south of England, York is a good halfway point).</p>
<p>On 24th May 2022, we held a 50th anniversary lunch celebration at Amarone in George Street, Edinburgh. This allowed us to revisit old haunts and recall many happy memories from our three years of study in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The group had travelled from Devon, Somerset, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Argyll, Perthshire, the Borders and East Lothian</p>]]></Value>
