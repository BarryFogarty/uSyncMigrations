<ul>
<li><strong>Our graduates are recognised by employers as being independent learners who can address problems creatively.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will be taught by highly experienced lecturers who are well respected in their fields. They engage in innovative research, contribute to knowledge development and translation and have strong personal links with practice settings.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We have small class sizes, therefore our staff will really get to know you. We genuinely care about your journey and will recognise your strengths and where you most need support.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We are in the top 5 of UK universities for Counselling, Psychotherapy and Occupational Therapy (Complete University Guide 2024).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this course you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore how to provide practical support to empower people, facilitate health and wellbeing, and help identify and respond to barriers that prevent people from doing what really matters to them.</li>
<li>Learn a wide range of transferable personal and professional skills, understanding why and how people engage in occupations and what might disrupt patterns of occupation; critically engaging with knowledge and evidence that informs the profession; and collaborating with services to address needs of their communities.</li>
<li>Develop an appreciation of how individual’s lives can be shaped by society including environments, history, or systems and how these factors can impact health.</li>
<li>Learn through a variety of approaches, and practical placements are a key element of the course, giving you the opportunity to translate your learning into practice and to work with a wide range of services and populations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Living, not existing, that is a primary objective for the profession. As an occupational therapist, you will work with individuals, groups and communities to foster participation in the aspects of life that people need, want and have to do. This course is your first step towards a rewarding and diverse healthcare career with excellent employment prospects.</p>
<p>This is a four year integrated undergraduate master’s course. Students commence the course with a view to graduating with a Master of Occupational Therapy (MOccTh) in four years. The majority of modules are taught alongside postgraduate students studying on the accelerated MSc Occupational Therapy (Pre-Registration) course. There is an option for students to transfer to a BSc (Hons) route at the end of year two and they will still be eligible to apply for registration with the HCPC as an occupational therapist.</p>

There are two aspects of the open day that still stand out to me, including the modern, en-suite student rooms in the halls of residence. The second was a comment made by a lecturer about the occupational therapy course – “don’t study at QMU if you want to be able to sit at the back of lectures and not be noticed”. My course was made up of about 40 people, so you really could not go unnoticed in classes.\"",
