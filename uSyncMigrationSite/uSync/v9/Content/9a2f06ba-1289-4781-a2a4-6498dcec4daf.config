      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Dr Chris Wang from  Shanghai, China has announced a Cultural Management Scholarship at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh. The move will provide much needed financial support for a cultural management student, as well as crucial skills development opportunities with the Chinese Art and Cultural Festival.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Dr Wang is the producer of the Chinese Art and Cultural Festival which is part of Edinburgh’s Fringe Festival. </p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Based in Shanghai, Dr Wang is responsible for bringing some of the highest quality Chinese productions to Scotland each summer. The Chinese Art and Cultural Festival is now a prominent feature within Edinburgh's Fringe Festival. He also produces the World Clown Festival in China which has become the largest gathering of clowns in the world.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Having studied for several years in the USA under the direction of Professor Joe Goldblatt, the world’s leading academic in event management, Dr Wang is passionate about event and cultural management and is keen to nurture talented young people who wish to contribute to the cultural and creative industries.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Goldblatt, Director of the Centre for the Study of Planned Events at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, said: “Dr Wang was one of my most determined and promising students when I lectured in Washington and I’m proud that he has gone on to establish this important cultural relationship with the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He is responsible for bringing a range of outstanding Chinese productions to Scotland’s capital city, and for providing graduates with the opportunity to develop skills and experience within the cultural sector.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Goldblatt continued: “His generous donation has allowed us to establish the University’s first scholarship in Cultural Management for students on the MA in Arts, Festival and Cultural Management. The annual £1,000 donation marks the first gift to Queen Margaret University from China. This will not only provide important financial support to a student on the MA programme, but offers an invaluable opportunity to work as part of the organising team on this year’s Chinese Art and Cultural Festival.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Queen Margaret University and Dr Wang intend to create more exciting opportunities for cultural management students in the future. The University is working with Dr Wang to develop a partnership between QMU and Donghua University in Shanghai. Hopefully, the initiative will open up opportunities for students at QMU to study part of their course in China, as well as facilitating Chinese cultural management students to continue their postgraduate education in Scotland.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Dr Wang is also working on ambitious plans with officials in his home country to establish ‘Shanghai Culture Week’ in Edinburgh and has initiated Asia's largest international Comedy Festival in Shanghai.</p>]]></Value>
