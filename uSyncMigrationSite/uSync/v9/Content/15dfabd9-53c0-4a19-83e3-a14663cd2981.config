You can exit at different points but single module study is not available.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching includes practical and academic elements with an emphasis on experiential and interpersonal learning and teaching methods, including lectures, seminars and tutorials. Practice education is supported by regular supervision at QMU. Students are not required to cover the cost for supervision at University or on placement.</p>\n<p>Assessments are varied and include practical and written formats as well as short video, poster and case work presentations. Personal development is fundamental to therapeutic training and it is a requirement of the HCPC that students attend regular personal psychotherapy throughout the course, with a minimum of 40 hours of attendance. Personal therapy is not assessed and students are required to cover the cost. Independent study is in addition to this, as well as days specifically for practice-based learning: one day/week in year one and two days/ week in year two.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice-based Learning (Placements) </strong></p>\n<p>Practice-based learning is ongoing throughout the course. In Year One, your placement  is usually with a music therapist, one day per week from October through to March. In Year Two, you attend practice-based learning two days per week throughout both semesters and work in a more autonomous way.</p>\n<p>The range of practice-based learning is extensive including placements within hospitals, schools, voluntary sector organisations, child and family centres, drug and alcohol services, hospices, community based health centres, community based mental health teams, day centres for the elderly and for adults with physical and/or learning disabilities. The range of practice placements for Music Therapy students changes from year to year.</p>\n<p>Practice-based learning can also be arranged further afield if students choose to commute; the course has excellent partnerships with practice education providers across the UK, Ireland and Gibraltar. Students do not need to find their own placements: practice placements are organised by the Professional Practice Tutor at QMU.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module requires attendance of classes at QMU: typically, Year One students attend QMU on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and in Year Two, classes are on a Thursday. Practice placement days and independent study are in addition to this.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>There are (maximum) 25 places for each cohort. </p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

You should be able to demonstrate a high degree of skill and flexibility on at least one instrument. You do not need to be able to read Western musical notation. We are committed to enabling and widening access for musicians from diverse backgrounds.</p>\n<p>You will also have a minimum of one year’s experience of relevant work experience with persons in the community, education or health settings.

Your personal statement should include the reasons you feel drawn to the profession of music therapy at this stage in your life and why the particular approach taught at QMU appeals to you. Please include an outline of any texts you have read in preparation for this course. We would also like to hear about your own relationship with music and how this has shaped your decision to apply. In addition, please detail any relevant experience within caring professions, which does not need to be music related, and highlight particular qualities you feel you would bring to the course.</li>\n<li>Applicants will be asked to attend interview and audition (see below).</li>\n<li>A satisfactory criminal records check from the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme, an occupational health check and personal indemnity insurance (normally through membership of the professional body) are required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disability/health conditions</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a disability, long-term physical or mental health condition, or learning disability, it should not stand in the way of your studying at QMU.

Applications are reviewed by members of the course team and you will either be sent feedback at that stage or offered an interview and audition.</p>\n<p><strong>About the audition and interview</strong></p>\n<p>The audition usually includes a group improvisation with other applicants and an individual audition. The audition is your chance to demonstrate your breadth of musicianship: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please prepare a short piece on two different instruments (or two contrasting pieces if you are playing one instrument)</li>\n<li>If you don’t use your voice in these pieces, you are also required to sing a short song</li>\n<li>Please be ready to improvise as directed on the day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We would recommend you bring your own instrument for the audition but larger instruments such as a clarsach, a piano, drum kit and guitars are available to play. Please <a href=\"mailto:therapy@qmu.ac.uk\">email the Music Therapy team</a> for any other queries.</p>\n<p>The interview aims to assess your personal suitability for the profession, your ability to reflect and readiness for the demands that the course entails. Members of the course team will be interested in talking to you about your personal statement.  </p>\n<p>When the interview and audition is conducted online, you will be asked to prepare for the audition and interview in the same way, but there is no group component.</p>\n<p>Applicants are advised of the outcome of their interview via the Admissions team within a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>Other information</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost of the PVG check (£18 or £59 depending on the level of clearance required*) and the professional indemnity insurance are the responsibility of the student.

    "content": "<p><strong>Does QMU have Open Days?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. These are on campus and online and provide an opportunity to speak to lecturers and meet with current students from the MSc Music Therapy. Please check the <a href=\"/open-days-and-meeting-us/postgraduate-open-events/\"><strong>Postgraduate Open Days</strong></a> page on the QMU website for forthcoming dates or follow @QMUMusicTherapy for notifications via Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I apply?</strong></p>\n<p>Applications are made online. Please click the ‘Apply to this course’ button on the top right of this page.</p>\n<p><strong>When should I apply?</strong></p>\n<p>Applications can be made from October of each year for the following September. Applicants are advised to apply as soon as possible and before the 1st May, although late applicants will be considered. Places fill up on a first come first served basis. If your application is successful, and the course is full, you will be offered a place on a waiting list.</p>\n<p><strong>When are interviews?</strong></p>\n<p>If your application is successful, you will be invited to interview at the University. They normally take place between January and June. For more information, contact: <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Contact Admissions\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> </p>\n<p><strong>What is the mode of attendance?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two fifteen-week semesters in each year: September – December; January – May.</p>\n<p>In Year One students attend two days at University (Tuesday and Wednesday) and one other weekday each week for practice placement.</p>\n<p>In Year Two students attend one day at University (Thursday) and two other days each week on practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I work at the same time?</strong></p>\n<p>Although attendance at University and practice placement is part-time (3 days/ week in each year) the course is full-time so you are required to make up the hours for independent study (equivalent to 2 days/ week).</p>\n<p><strong>Can I do the course by distance-learning?</strong></p>\n<p>Some aspects of the course can be studied online and there is much self-directed study. However, attendance at University is compulsory due to the necessity of interpersonal and experiential components.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a part-time route to MSc Music Therapy?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no part-time route at the moment. It is offered as a full-time 2-year, fast-track pre-registration (HCPC) course.</p>\n<p><strong>Who organises practice placements?</strong></p>\n<p>Practice Placements are arranged and allocated by the Professional Practice Tutor at QMU. Students are not expected to find their own placements. Before Year One and Two, students are invited to complete a form to indicate choice, previous experience and address during Semesters. Wherever possible, practice placements are arranged in, or near to, the city where the student lives but this is also balanced by each student’s learning needs and preferences, which are all taken into consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Are all the practice placements in Scotland?</strong></p>\n<p>We have approved placement sites in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Aberdeen and many other areas in Scotland, but also in England, Northern Ireland and Ireland. Students are placed in a site that we consider will offer the best learning experience. Our good links with managers at various practice placement settings around the UK and Ireland mean that we can aim to offer all students a placement that makes sense geographically.</p>\n<p><strong>What kinds of practice placements are offered?</strong></p>\n<p>The range of practice placements are extensive including placements within hospitals, schools, voluntary sector organisations, child and family centres, drug and alcohol services, hospices, community based health centres, community based mental health teams, day centres for the elderly and for adults with physical and/or learning disabilities. The range of practice placements for Music Therapy students changes from year to year.</p>\n<p><strong>Who supervises practice placement?</strong></p>\n<p>In Year One, all students are usually supervised by a music therapist who works on-site. In Year Two, students have the opportunity to work more autonomously and often in a setting where there has previously been no Music Therapy. They are supervised by another professional who works in the setting.</p>\n<p>All students receive regular clinical supervision at University in small groups and attendance to these is a co-requisite of practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong>When should I start personal psychotherapy?</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to attend personal psychodynamic psychotherapy for the duration of the MSc Music Therapy course (as all HCPC registered courses in the UK) and to show evidence of at least 40 hours throughout the 2-year course. Responsibility for finding a therapist rests with the student and ideally should be in place for the start of the course.</p>\n<p>In general students are advised to work with a therapist whose orientation is compatible with the psychodynamic orientation of the course, with a minimum of 5 years’ experience, and registered with UKCP or BACP. Further details are provided in the Programme Handbook which is sent to students before the course start.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the course fees? </strong></p>\n<p>See the Fees and Funding button on the course website for fees and updated information on possible student funding.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any other costs?</strong></p>\n<p>Fees for personal psychotherapy range on average from £40-60 per session. It is important to bear this additional expense in mind and budget for it.</p>\n<p>The HCPC requires that all music therapists, including trainees, must have personal indemnity insurance.</p>\n<p>If you have been resident in Scotland for at least 3 years, your travel and accommodation costs for placement are covered. Otherwise applicants are advised to plan to cover such costs.</p>\n<p>Your name badge for practice placements is a one-off payment of £7.</p>\n<p>All students have occupational health checks before beginning the first practice placement but this cost is covered by QMU. </p>\n<p><strong>Are there grants, trusts or scholarships for the course ?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no grants available but international students can apply for a QMU scholarship. Some students have sought funding from other sources by consulting information on Education Awards in their local library. Other students have obtained a Career Development Loan from their bank, or received part funding from their employers.</p>\n<p><strong>Do full fees need to be paid at the outset of the academic year?</strong></p>\n<p>No, there are other options. See the QMU website for further details.  </p>\n<p><strong>What sort of tutorial support is available to students? </strong></p>\n<p>Each student on the course has a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT). The role of the Personal Academic Tutor is to help students integrate the different parts of the course, review their work and be aware of any circumstances affecting the student’s learning on the course. Students meet with their Personal Academic Tutor at least once each semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there support within University for students with disabilities?</strong></p>\n<p>A member of the course team is an academic disability student coordinator and will meet with students to discuss requirements and offer advice in liaison with the academic disability services.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there help with writing?</strong></p>\n<p>The team within the <a href=\"/study-here/student-services/effective-learning-service-els/\"><strong>Effective Learning Services at QMU</strong></a> offer workshops for all students and on every aspect of academic study, including essay preparation. Tutorials are also offered for students whose first language is not English. </p>\n<p><strong>What support is offered to international students before the course begins?</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend the <strong><u><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/4b2aea00b4484c2db6777532e958a802}\" title=\"Pre-sessional Courses\">pre-sessional programmes</a></u></strong> to all applicants whose first language is not English. These are FREE and a run as a 4 week block from mid-August up to induction week.</p>\n<p><strong>How many students are in each cohort?</strong></p>\n<p>There are up to 25 students in each cohort however workshops, supervision and tutorials are in small groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Do most students find employment after they graduate?</strong></p>\n<p>Our graduates have a high level of employment with some students creating a post from their practice placement in Year Two. </p>\n<p>Employment opportunities vary, with some regions of the UK offering more employment possibilities for qualified music therapists than others.</p>\n<p>Students are offered classes with the Careers Adviser for the School of Health Sciences, to help explore careers options and think about how to approach employment upon graduation, including mock interviews. Students are encouraged to make the most of their local networks, which in turn promote employment.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the research interests of the staff?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/e3ea675649a64d89b91ec7c02bd71188}\" title=\"OTAT Staff\">staff</a> member's details on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I find out more about Music Therapy?</strong></p>\n<p>Join British Association for Music Therapy.
