    "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>During your first two years, you’ll join a diverse cohort of students, exploring the fundamental principles of physiotherapy and gain hands-on practice experience through placement-based learning within health and social care.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will move on to either the BSc (Hons) or the undergraduate master’s pathway depending on your aspirations and performance. Both pathways develop professional skills, knowledge and attributes through a combination of university and placement-based learning. The undergraduate master’s offer an opportunity to delve deeper into areas such as leadership, service improvement, research and public health, at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Upon graduation, both pathways lead to eligibility for registration with the HCPC, opening doors to a fulfilling career in physiotherapy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\"><strong>Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will be taught in lectures, seminars, practical workshops and laboratories. Outside these timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through both directed and self-directed study. You will be assessed using a range of methods including practical exams and written course work at the end of each module or semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and practice educators. You will complete practice placements in each year.</p>\n<p>Placements take place within the NHS and a variety of linked settings covering all pillars of physiotherapy practice at various locations across Scotland.</p>\n<p>QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student with the exception of the elective placement. The elective placement is organised by each individual student and provides the potential for a practice-based placement in a speciality area of interest or outside of the UK. It may be possible for you to undertake a single, elective, practice-based placement outside the UK.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employability placements take place across Scotland with students normally undertaking half their placements in NHS Lothian and the rest in other health boards across Scotland. For some health boards relocation for the duration of the placement might be required unless there are individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location. </p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern specialist spaces for use by our physiotherapy courses. Two large practical rooms are utilised for teaching and development of clinical skills. Students have access to numerous anatomy models which are incorporated into their learning during practical sessions and can be used during self-directed study sessions.  Our physiotherapy students also utilize QMU's clinical simulation suite which is equipped to practice both hands on skills and communication in a simulated real-life environment. The courses also have access to a motion analysis lab and human performance lab.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>\n<p>For more information, please also visit ‘<a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/how-we-teach-and-how-youll-learn-undergraduate/\"><strong>How we teach and how you’ll learn</strong></a>’.</p>"
