<p>The aim of this policy is to outline the University's commitment to supporting staff and managers in preventing and addressing workplace stress.<br /><br /><span class="lead">2.0 - Scope of Policy</span></p>
<p>This policy applies to the University's responsibility as an employer, and applies to all employees of Queen Margaret University. Stress is a complex subject and the University has to deal with its effects, irrespective of its source. Whilst work related stress is addressed, other causes of stress are considered.</p>
<p><span class="lead">3.0 - Equality and Diversity</span></p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is committed to equality of opportunity for all staff and it is the responsibility of all QMU employees to promote equality and diversity in the application of this policy, ensuring that there is no discrimination on the grounds of disability, race/ethnic origin, sex/gender, age, religion, marital/family status, dependency, sexual orientation or gender re-assignment.</p>
<p><span class="lead">4.0 - Responsibility for this Policy</span></p>
<p>Human Resources staff and the University’s Health and Safety committee oversee this policy and managers are responsible for the implementation of this policy. <br />Any changes to this policy and supporting procedures will be made in consultation with appropriate bodies.</p>
<p><span class="lead">5.0 - Introduction</span></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the health, safety and welfare of our employees. We recognise that workplace stress is a health and safety issue and acknowledge the importance of identifying and reducing workplace stressors. It is the policy of QMU to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that no member of staff is subjected to a level of stress due to work which is detrimental to their health. <br /><br />The University aims to create an environment where, if workplace stress does occur, it can be dealt with openly and fairly. QMU also commits itself to investigating all claims of ill health due to work place stress to ensure appropriate action is taken to prevent any recurrence of the situation. <br /><br />It is widely recognised that work related stress is a major cause of occupational ill health in the UK which can cause severe physical and psychological conditions. It can also lead to poor productivity and human error, increased sickness absence, increases in accidents, high staff turnover and poor performance. <br /><br />The University commits to the following action to prevent and address workplace stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct risk assessments to identify workplace stressors and eliminate or control the risks from stress. These risk assessments will be regularly reviewed.</li>
<li>Consult with trade union safety representatives on all proposed action relating to the prevention of workplace stress.</li>
<li>Provide training for all managers and supervisors in good management practices.</li>
<li>Provide confidential counselling for staff affected by stress caused by either work or external factors.</li>
<li>Provide adequate resources to enable managers to implement the University’s agreed stress management policy</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">6.0 - Definition of Stress</span></p>
<p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) defines stress as ‘the adverse reaction people have to excessive pressure or other types of demand placed on them’. This makes an important distinction between pressure, which can be positive if managed correctly, and stress, which is likely to be detrimental to physical or mental health if it is prolonged. <br /><br />Pressure is part and parcel of work and helps to keep individuals motivated, but if demands and pressures (‘stresses and stressors’) become too great, they can induce, in anyone, the harmful or potentially harmful mental and physical feelings and reactions commonly known as “stress”. <br /><br />Stress is considered to be a state, not an illness. However, if stress becomes too excessive and prolonged, mental and physical ill health may develop. </p>
<p><span class="lead">7.0 - Legal Context and HSE Management Standards </span></p>
<p>Employers have duties under the following: <br /><br />(i) Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, to assess the risk of stress related ill health arising from work activities; and <br /><br />(ii) The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, to take measures to control that risk. <br /><br />The HSE has provided a set of standards for managing stress in the workplace. Compliance with the management standards is not a legal requirement. However they are recognised as providing an approach that, if followed, will meet the statutory requirements posed by legislation.</p>

<p>The management standards can be used to identify the primary causes of stress and make the process of managing stress in the workplace easier and more effective. The primary causes of stress are:</p>
