    "content": "<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Why come for counselling?</span><br />Counselling offers you the opportunity to talk in private about anything that’s troubling you. It is a completely confidential process where the counsellor will listen carefully to what you have to say and will not judge you or tell you what to do. The aim is to help you understand things more clearly so that you can see for yourself how to deal with things more effectively.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">When is counselling a good idea?</span><br />The Counselling Service aims to be welcoming and friendly and it is a good idea to make contact if you feel you’re not coping very well. Counselling is often seen as a last resort and can even be perceived as a sign of failure, but it isn’t. Knowing how to look after yourself is an important life skill, part of which is knowing when you need some extra support or help accessing available resources.</p>\n<p>You can also use counselling for personal development, to increase awareness of who you are and how you relate to others, to build self-esteem, and to help resolve issues which might be preventing you from fulfilling your potential.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">What do people talk about?</span><br />In counselling you are free to talk about yourself and any issues which are affecting your wellbeing. Some common topics raised by students are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relationships</li>\n<li>Anxiety</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>Loss</li>\n<li>Low self-esteem</li>\n<li>Eating problems</li>\n<li>Sexual identity</li>\n<li>Abuse</li>\n<li>Self harm</li>\n<li>Academic concerns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also get self-help information by looking in the self help section of this page and on Student Central.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-big\">Who are the counsellors?</span></p>\n<p>The Student Counsellors are Konstantina, Sarah and Sophie.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://pro.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?tid=b41da2b1-c99a-4f59-88d1-ac41008dad15\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Introduction to QMU Counselling\" data-anchor=\"?tid=b41da2b1-c99a-4f59-88d1-ac41008dad15\">Watch an introduction to QMU Counselling by Sarah on Panopto</a></p>\n<p><br />All counsellors work within the <a href=\"http://www.bacp.co.uk/ethical_framework/\" title=\"Ethical Framework of BCAP\">Ethical Framework of BACP</a>.</p>"

The information that you choose to share within the Student Counselling Service will be treated confidentially and held within the Student Counselling and Wellbeing Team. This includes Student Counsellors, Wellbeing Advisors, Student Services Administrators and Head of Student Services. Contact and session notes are inly accessed by the team on a need-to-know basis, such as when we have concerns about a student's welfare or safety, to administer the service, such as booking appointments, or to liaise within the team about the most appropriate support. Some anonymised data is collected to inform and develop the service - for example, main reasons for contacting the service and presenting issues. Following an initial assessment, counsellors make a summary notes of issues discussed.   </p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\">Information held about you is processed by Queen Margaret University in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations) 2018, the University’s Data Protection Policy and Student Privacy Statement.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"><br />Confidentiality may be extended in the following scenarios. Only minimal and required information will be shared to ensure the necessary help is sought: <br />- The Student Counselling Service is part of Queen Margaret University’s Student Services. As a student accessing the service, your attendance and information may, on occasion, be shared with other Student Services Staff to ensure that you are able to receive the most effective and co-ordinated support. If you make a request for evidence to support Extenuating Circumstances then this will be provided in the form of a document, returned to you, that you can then pass on to the relevant academic staff member if you wish.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\">- If your Counsellor believes that your life, or that of another person, may be in immediate or significant danger they will endeavour to inform you of such disclosure but this may not always be possible. For example, the provision of relevant information to the Head of Student Services, Security, First Aid or paramedic staff in an emergency.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\">- Where your Counsellor would be subject to criminal court procedure should the information not be disclosed. For example, where sharing information would be essential to prevent a serious and imminent threat to public health, national security, the life of the individual or a third party, or to prevent or detect serious crime.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\">- With your express and written consent to pass on information either within the University or to other external sources of support.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"><br />At your Initial Assessment your Counsellor will outline procedures in place and address any clarification you may need. In line with professional ethical frameworks that Counsellors work with, there is a requirement to discuss client work with an external supervisor to aid best practice. All discussions take place without your identity being revealed.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"><br /><span class=\"lead\">Record keeping and Third Party Information</span></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"><br />Following each session, notes are made by your Counsellor to main points, including a synopsis of past experience and immediate concerns. These are stored securely and password protected and kept for seven years after the last academic year of contact in order to administer the service and maintain professional standards.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"><br />Under the Data Protection Act 1998 and GDPR 2018, students accessing the Student Counselling Service have the right to access all information held about them by the Student Counselling Service, in which case a Subject Access Request (SAR) should be made.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"><br />Information that comes into the Student Counselling Service from a third party, e.g. from your GP, PAT, other Student Service or concerned other will be shared with you in the interests of transparency and integrity of the therapeutic relationship. Exceptions to this would be if permission from the third party has not been granted or when the Counsellor believes that another person’s established right to confidentiality may be breached in the process.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"><br /><span class=\"lead\">Complaints</span><br />We welcome comments and feedback and have a form for you to share your thoughts so please just ask for a copy. If you wish to raise a complaint then please discuss the issue with your Counsellor in the first instance. If, after further exploration, you wish to formally pursue the complaint then we ask that you use the Queen Margaret University’s Complaints Procedure.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlackBold\"> </p>"
