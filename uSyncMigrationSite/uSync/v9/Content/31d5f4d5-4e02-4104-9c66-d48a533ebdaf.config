Through this course, film and media studies graduates, professionals and those wishing to work in film will gain a detailed understanding of the different routes and jobs in the industry.</p>\n<p>In the film sector, a skills gap was identified among recent graduates, whose current priorities are centred around the creative roles of film director, editor or screenwriter.</p>\n<p>There is however a growing need for professionals whose focus is on the film world as an industry, which requires people with fusion skills, (creative, technical and entrepreneurial skills across the value chain), problem solving and analytical skills (pre- and post-production), and cross-cultural insights in the continued globalisation of the sector. This course engages students with in-depth knowledge of, and insight into, the global film industries’ increasingly networked and professional versatility.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Range of Career Prospects:</span></p>\n<p>By understanding the elements of production, distribution and exhibition, you will learn how to be most effective as a cog in the world’s film industries.</p>\n<p>You will gain insight into film policy, pre-production, sales and distribution networks and programming/curation. Drawing on QMU’s existing portfolio of courses in business, PR, film, media and cultural industries, this new course has been inspired by the professional experiences of our academic staff.</p>"
