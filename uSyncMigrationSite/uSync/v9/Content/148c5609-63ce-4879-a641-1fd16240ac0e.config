Court members are drawn from a range of backgrounds and professions, and include staff and student members.</p>\n<p>The Court is made up of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Between 11 and 15 lay members who bring with them skills and experience of value to the University.</li>\n<li>The Principal and Deputy Principal.</li>\n<li>Three staff members, two of whom are elected by staff, one who is elected by Senate and</li>\n<li>The Student President and one other Students’ Union office-bearer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Role Description</span></p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>Court members commit to conducting themselves in accordance with accepted standards of public life, which includes openness, objectivity, integrity, honesty and accountability. Independent (Lay) members and elected members hold office for an initial term of 3 years but may serve a second term. Ex-officio members serve for the length of their term in office.</li>\n<li>Members exercise their responsibilities in the interests of the University as a whole rather than as a representative of any constituency. They agree to abide by the University Court’s Code of Conduct and complete a Register of Interests form annually.</li>\n<li>Court members are expected to play an appropriate part in ensuring that the necessary business of the Court is carried on efficiently, effectively, and in a manner appropriate to the proper conduct of public business. They are expected to make rational and constructive contributions to debate and to make their knowledge and expertise available to the Court as opportunity arises.</li>\n<li>Members have a responsibility for ensuring that the Court acts in accordance with the instruments of governance of the University and with the University’s internal rules and regulations, and to seek advice from the Secretary in any case of uncertainty.</li>\n<li>Court members must make a full and timely disclosure of personal interests to the Secretary in accordance with the procedures approved by the Court. They must, as soon as practicable, disclose any interest which they have in any matter under discussion and accept the ruling of the Chair in relation to the management of that situation, in order that the integrity of the business of the Court and its Committees may be, and may be seen to be, maintained.</li>\n<li>Court members have particular legal responsibilities for the University which is a company limited by guarantee and an exempt charity.</li>\n<li>Court members may be appointed by the Court to at least one Committee of the Court and are expected to play a full part in the business of all Committees to which they are appointed.</li>\n<li>Court members may be asked to represent the Court and the University externally, and will be fully briefed by the University to enable them to carry out this role effectively.</li>\n<li>Court members may also be asked to act as advocates on behalf of the University. This may include a role in liaising between key stakeholders and the University, or in fund-raising.</li>\n<li>The likely overall time commitment required of Court members averages between 10-15 days per year. The Court meets on at least 5 occasions per academic year, and has a two-day Away Day on campus in the spring, which may involve an overnight stay. Court members may meet individually with the Chair or Vice-Chair once or twice a year, and may be required to attend sub-committee meetings three or four times a year. There is background reading associated with each of these meetings.</li>\n<li>In addition to the requirements set out above, Court members are invited to attend events held by the University, including the annual graduation ceremony in early July, professorial lectures, social and celebratory events.</li>\n<li>Court members are not remunerated for their work as Court members, but are encouraged to reclaim all travelling and similar expenses incurred in the course of University business via the Secretary pursuant to the University policy on this issue. Directors and Officers Liability Insurance is in place.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Person Specification</span></p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>Members should demonstrate a strong, personal commitment to Higher Education, its governance and the values, aims and objectives of Queen Margaret University. Lay members of Court should have experience as a member of committees/boards or experience of operating at a strategic level in a professional role.</li>\n<li>Members should have the ability to act fairly and impartially in the interests of the University as a whole, using independent judgement and maintaining confidentiality as appropriate. Members should have the ability to act as an ambassador and represent the University to the wider community and to operate as a member of a team.</li>\n<li>Members should be excellent communicators with appropriate negotiation, presentation and<br />influencing skills.</li>\n<li>Members should be supportive of the University’s ethos, mission and values, and be committed<br />to equality, diversity and inclusivity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>"
