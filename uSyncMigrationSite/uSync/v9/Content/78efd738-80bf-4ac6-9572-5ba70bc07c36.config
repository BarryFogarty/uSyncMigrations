    "title": "About the course",
    "content": "<p>As a nurse, you will be at the forefront of healthcare, meeting a broad range of people who truly need your expertise and empathy. Nurses are involved in promoting health and preventing illness in addition to caring for sick and dying people. This can take place in a variety of environments, which include health centres, homes, residential/care homes and hospitals. A career in nursing can take you into leadership and management, education and research, at home and overseas. Wherever you choose to specialise in the future, as a nurse you will be an advocate for the people in your care. You will make a difference.</p>\n<p>This course will prepare you to confidently deliver safe, effective and person-centred nursing care. It will offer you the chance to be part of a community of learners, working collaboratively with lecturers, clinical staff, service users and other students on a transformational journey towards registration. You will actively engage in creative and critical ways of working and learning including approaches such as critical inquiry, reflection, contemplation, simulation and practice learning experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Year One:</strong> <em>Knowing self and others.</em> This year focuses on the foundations of professional nursing care. You will explore a range of influences on health, professional issues, skills for nursing practice, and the bio-sciences to inform person-centred care. You will focus on the healthy person and healthy communities. Students will start to develop research and academic enquiry skills in Year One and these are embedded throughout the programme.You will begin to learn to meet the needs of people across the lifespan and what the key health challenges may be nationally and internationally. We focus on supporting and facilitating your own self-care, incorporating contemplative learning approaches. Clinical skills learning will prepare you for practice learning experiences in a variety of settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Year Two:</strong> <em>Knowing self, others and society</em>. You will build on learning from Year One and learn how to plan and evaluate care in a person-centred way. The year focuses on facilitating and supporting health and self-care in persons/family/carers. You will learn how to assess and care for people as they cope and adapt to ill health, combining science subjects with nursing care. Clinical skills learning will prepare you for practice learning experiences in a variety of settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Year Three:</strong> <em>Knowing how to develop self and others.</em> Year Three concentrates on the care of people with complex needs and increasing dependency in a range of settings. Making person-centred judgements and decisions will be a focus. Leadership skills will be further developed and the promotion of person-centred cultures in care environments. You will explore healthcare governance and research evidence relating to effective, compassionate nursing practice. Further clinical skills learning will prepare you for practice learning experiences in a variety of settings and you will develop knowledge of the integration of health and social care through engagement with the voluntary sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Year Four:</strong> Focuses on integrating previous learning to enable you to graduate as a registered nurse with advanced skills. There will be completion of a portfolio and development of research themes related to current healthcare priorities to support development of a dissertation/ final project. Final year skills work will involve more advanced assessment and practice learning experiences. This will prepare you for registration and include preparation for prescribing in the future and supervising students when registered.</p>"

The hours will be the same for the BSc (Hons) and master’s route.
