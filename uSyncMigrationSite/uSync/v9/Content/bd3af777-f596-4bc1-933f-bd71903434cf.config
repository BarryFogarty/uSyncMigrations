      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>This year, QMU students will host a production of William Shakespeare’s classic ‘The Winter's Tale’. The performance will be hosted in Edinburgh’s iconic Summerhall venue with a 100-person capacity to give as many as possible the opportunity to enjoy this breath-taking and </span><span>imaginative </span><span>production.</span> </p>
<p><span>This year's show will be larger than</span><span> the 2022 production </span><span>with 60 students from across QMU’s creative disciplines contributing. This predominantly student-led theatrical event will showcase all the talent and hard work of the next generation of theatre-makers and creative professionals. </span> </p>
<p><span>'The Winter’s Tale’ is one of Shakespeare's comedic p</span><span>lays which follows th</span><span>e story of jealous King Leontes of Sicily. In QMU’s production, Leontes’ inner turmoil will infiltrate the external world through elements of the set design. Moreover, the award-winning director and QMU lecturer Kate Nelson has delved into the psyche of Leontes and has helped to bring his hallucinations to life through her </span><span>ingenious </span><span>direction.</span> </p>
<p><span>While maintaining many of the traditional elements of a Shakespeare production, this magical-realist reimagining will submerge the audience in a world of enchantment and glitter. It will feature all the classic Shakespearean elements like farcical humour, forbidden romance and redemption but puts its own unique spin on the show - including a twist on the infamous stage direction ‘exit, pursued by a bear’, </span><span>which sees one of the characters meet their death in the most unlikely of ways. </span> </p>
<p><span>QMU’s student show is a wonderful opportunity to see the range of creativity and talent across the creative disciplines at the University. The audience is sure to enjoy the spectacular costumes designed by the BA (Hons) Costume Design and Construction students and the fantastic performances by BA (Hons) Theatre and Film, Drama, Performance and Acting students. </span> </p>
<p><span>Student Maryrose Otajele, who is taking on the role of the show’s PR &amp; Marketing Manager, said: “Shakespeare’s never been done like this before. It has been fascinating to see the inner workings of a production of this scale.”  </span> </p>
<p><span>Student Steph Hume, Musical Director, offers an insight into the show’s musical concept: “Exploring choral music with verses in Gaelic, our characters use acapella to communicate the themes of the play throughout.”</span> </p>
<p><span>John Dean, QMU’s Head of the Media, Communications and Performing Arts Division, said: "Our End of Year show events are the most exciting nights of the academic year. It’s wonderful to experience such a melting pot of student talent and to witness the culmination of many years of hard work and learning. It’s particularly rewarding to have so many of the students’ families there to see the show and to host invited guests from the creative industries. We are incredibly proud of our students and are excited that the End of Year Show is a helpful launchpad for students as they move from university to begin their professional careers.”</span> </p>
<p><span>The show will run over three days, from June 1</span><span data-fontsize="10">st</span><span> to June 3</span><span data-fontsize="10">rd</span><span>, 2023. The evening show will start at 7:30pm every day and on June 3</span><span data-fontsize="10">rd</span><span> there will also be a matinee that will begin at 2:30pm. Tickets will cost just £11 or </span><span>£10 for concessions.</span> </p>
<p><span>Performances </span><span>will take place at Summerhall, Newington, EH9 1PL. </span><span>Tickets will be on sale soon and can be purchased from Summerhall Box Office - 0131 560 1564. </span> </p>
<p><span>Summerhall has wheelchair access,</span><span> and t</span><span>he show aims to be fully accessible.</span> </p>]]></Value>
