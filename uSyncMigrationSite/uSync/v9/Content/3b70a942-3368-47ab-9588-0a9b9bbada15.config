Indeed, the current draft Cultural Strategy in Scotland looks at embedding artistic and creative practices across numerous sectors, inviting artists, theatre makers, musicians and all creative practitioners to be productive within industry, business, education and social settings.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the arts are becoming more important within health and wellbeing contexts and the recent national report ‘Creative Health: Arts for Health and Wellbeing’ calls for artists to play a vital role in the social health and well-being of the population to the extent that GPs in England can prescribe artistic activities in order to tackle social issues such as obesity, loneliness and depression. This PgCert will introduce students to the main concepts that this growing sector is wrestling with and provide a strong base to build and develop your career as an Applied Arts Practitioner.</p>\n<p>You will complete three modules on this block-taught PgCert, and you can select to study topics such as Ethics, Social Practice, and Fundraising. It provide students with a good base of knowledge, skills and experience to best prepare them for applying the arts and creativity to areas such as third-sector organisations – ie public health, social welfare, or education.</p>"

You do need to select at least two of our core modules and if selecting only two of these core modules, you will need to take one of the optional modules.</p>\n<p>Core modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Applied Arts: Theories and Histories (20 credits): </strong>Taking a historical perspective as a grounding, this module examines the theoretical justification of Applied Arts, using case studies and past projects. It grounds the students thinking about the types of histories and legacies that can be drawn from to complicate the practices of engagement</li>\n<li><strong>Social Practice: Working With People (20 credits)</strong>- This module examines the practical skills required to engage with people, examining concepts such as dialogue, inter-personal skills, group facilitation skills. The most practical of the modules, students get to try out and engage with groups and communities in order to expand their skillsets and experience in working with people. </li>\n<li><strong>Practice Research (20 credits): </strong>This module is driven by reflective considerations on the student’s own practice, and explores how to position this work as ‘research.’ It will consist of exploring broader theoretical reflections on the purpose of research, but also case-studies and insights from guest speakers and experts in the field who can speak of their own practical experience of engaging in Applied Arts/Social Practice projects</li>\n<li><strong>The Only Way is Ethics: Art Representation and Ethics (20 credits): </strong>The module is designed to develop critical and practical skills needed for students to engage with the public in the delivery of cultural projects. It looks at examples from history as well as contemporaneous projects that engage with people at the ethical edges of participation to challenge the student to develop their own ethical frameworks. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optional modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fundraising, Finance and Development (20 credits): </strong>This module will equip students with a critical understanding of the principles and practices of fundraising, development and financial management. The assessments invite students to examine financial support mechanisms (eg, completing a funding application or designing a sponsorship pack) as well as financial literacy exam. This module marks our course as quite unique in this regards. </li>\n<li><strong>Planning and Marketing Cultural Projects (20 credits): </strong>This module will provide students with a critical understanding of the principal skills, techniques and practices necessary to manage and market a cultural project. This modules looks at the practical realities of managing and marketing cultural projects and learning occurs around hypothetical projects that the students plan and market in groups. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The modules listed are correct at time of posting (October 2022) but are subject to change. In the event that modules change, QMU will seek to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that there is no detrimental impact on students.</p>"
