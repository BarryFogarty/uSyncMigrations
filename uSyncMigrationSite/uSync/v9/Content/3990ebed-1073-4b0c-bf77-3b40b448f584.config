    "content": "<p>Behind the scenes, the film industry consists of a complex network of people, companies and institutions. Through this course, film and media studies graduates, professionals and those wishing to work in film will gain a detailed understanding of the different routes and jobs in the industry.</p>\n<p>In the film sector, a skills gap was identified among recent graduates, whose current priorities are centred around the creative roles of film director, editor or screen writer. There is however a growing need for professionals whose focus is on the film world as an industry, which requires people with fusion skills, (creative, technical and entrepreneurial skills across the value chain), problem solving and analytical skills (pre- and post-production), and cross-cultural insights in the continued globalisation of the sector. This course provides students with in-depth knowledge of and insights into the increasingly networked and multifaceted global film industries.</p>\n<p>By understanding the elements of production, distribution and exhibition, you will learn how to be most effective as a cog in the world’s film industries. You will gain insight into film policy, pre-production, sales and distribution networks and programming/curation. Drawing on QMU’s existing portfolio of courses in business, PR, film, media and cultural industries, this new course has been inspired by the professional experiences of our academic staff.</p>"

    "content": "<p><strong>Structure and exit awards</strong></p>\n<p>You can opt to study for the full MSc (180 credits), a PgDip (120 credits) or a PgCert (60 credits).</p>\n<p>You can also register as an associate student to complete a single module for CPD. On completion of a single module, you may wish to complete further modules and progress your studies to a named award. Contact <a href=\"mailto:mstewart@qmu.ac.uk\">Michael Stewart</a> for more information on single module study.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Our teaching strategies benefit from our experiences and relations with the local, the global and the transnational worlds of film, in ways that make the relationship between production, distribution and exhibition clear and productive. As such, the degree offers real-world scenarios, through industry engagement and observation.</p>\n<p>Teaching comprises a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, workshops, case studies, simulation exercises, field trips and projects. Assessment throughout the course will take a variety of forms, including essays, reflections, reports, group and individual presentations, as well as a dissertation or project for the final MSc component.</p>\n<p>You will work in groups during workshops to develop and test your knowledge and work on an individual basis to complete assessments that will include marketing strategies, case studies, a variety of short films and other content. You will also work for an extended period, supervised by a QMU lecturer, to achieve critical knowledge of and insight on an aspect of the global film industry that suits your ambitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements/industry-based learning</strong></p>\n<p>The course does not include a formal placement, but we do require students to take up industry-based learning opportunities where possible to assist their learning and to put the theory into practice. Core modules include a form of industry engagement and observation, and the teaching team boasts industry relationships that students can benefit from through networking opportunities and field trips that can inspire client-based projects for their final projects.</p>\n<p>Indeed, industry-based experiences and opportunities are offered by most of the world-renowned film organisations based in Edinburgh. Although we support students to find opportunities, you are required to secure your own arrangements in line with your personal interests. As we are in Edinburgh, the world’s first and best ‘Festival City’, there is no end of opportunities, and we are well-regarded by our industry peers: many QMU alumni work in these organisations. If you are already working in the sector, you can use your existing employment as the site for your industry-based learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>We usually teach our modules over the course of 10 weeks. Each module involves around 30 hours of face-to-face teaching. Timetables will normally be available to matriculated students around one month before you commence your studies. The two taught semesters run from September to December and mid-January to mid-April, while the dissertation project takes place during the summer semester and must be submitted mid-August.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>Class sizes will depend on modules chosen but will normally be between 15-30 students. </p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page. Please note that teaching staff is subject to change.</p>\n<p> </p>"
