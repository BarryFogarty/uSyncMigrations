    "content": "<p>First-class researchers are much sought after in academia and by commercial and third sector organisations that want to gain an edge in their marketplace.  On this course, you will develop advanced research skills that are transferrable to almost any field. You will also learn how to apply your research techniques to real-world problems to make you more valuable to prospective employers.</p>\n<p>On the Research Methods module you will develop advanced research and analytical skills. The module on Communicating Research is important in a different way: here you will learn to think about how your research will be read, used and applied in the real world. Your approach will move beyond ‘how do I do this piece of research?’ to ‘what can this research do for people?’</p>\n<p>With this thorough grounding in research techniques and their relevance, you will move on to complete your own Research Project. You will comprehensively review the literature in your field, and then produce a final output, this could be either a research paper, a consultancy report or a briefing paper. Whatever forms it takes, your project is a major piece of work and is your chance to show the academic, scientific or commercial world exactly what you can do.</p>\n<p>The topic that you choose to research is up to you, as long as it’s in a subject that we teach. Past MRes students have researched topics as varied as eyewitness identification, molecular biology, the experience of living with type-2 diabetes, food bank use, and microbusinesses in Mexico. You will have the freedom to explore what fascinates you when developing a portfolio of research and analytical techniques.</p>\n<p>Please see the ‘Structure’ section for a full list of the post-nominal awards that we now offer. This means that the specific subject of your degree is named in its title.</p>"
