<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://rebuildconsortium.com/" target="_blank" title="ReBUILD Consortium">ReBUILD</a> was a multi-partner, multi-country research consortium that began in 2011. It aimed to enable poor people in post-conflict settings to access effective health care while reducing the costs of healthcare to health systems and those who use them.</p>
<p>In phase 2 (2017-2019), this project had four main research areas: performance-based financing; human resources for health; community health workers and demographic and distributional impacts of conflicts and implications for health systems. The countries where research was carried out were Cambodia, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zimbabwe. New settings for Phase 2 included Timor Leste, Liberia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Central African Republic.</p>
<p><strong>QMU's role in this project</strong></p>
<p>As well as providing technical co-direction for the full ReBUILD programme, researchers from the Institute for Global Health and Development at QMU led in the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>Performance-based financing (PBF)</strong></p>
<p>Our research in this area aimed to understand the proliferation of PBF programmes in fragile and conflict-affected states (FCAS), including humanitarian settings, their impacts on political economy and how they have affected health system purchasing. </p>
<p><strong>Demographic and distributional impacts of conflict and the impact on household vulnerability:</strong> <strong>generation, gender and disability (GENDIS)</strong></p>
<p>This area of work researched the uneven distribution of demographic change in three conflict-affected countries and the impact on household vulnerability and health care access.</p>
<p><strong>Thematic Working Group on Health Systems in Fragile and Conflict Affected States</strong></p>
<p>Staff at IGHD are heavily involved in the Steering Committee of the Thematic Working Group (TWG) on Health Systems in Fragile and Conflict Affected States (FCAS), one of 10 TWGs of Health Systems Global. The TWG FCAS brings together researchers, policy makers, funders and implementers working in fragile and conflict affected states to achieve better health, equity and well-being by strengthening health policy and systems research in these challenging contexts.</p>

    "content": "<p>Researchers at Queen Margaret University had three main areas of research within ReBUILD. These were focusing on performance-based financing and changing household demographics after conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>PBF</strong></p>\n<p>Performance-based financing, or PBF, is an incentive scheme where health care providers are paid depending on their performance. As well as examining the PBF programmes in three of the original ReBUILD countries, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, three new contexts were added to the research: Nigeria, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>\n<p>This and a hypothesis-led literature review gave insights into both how PBF programmes can evolve and how they can be adapted and implemented in more humanitarian settings.</p>\n<p><strong>GENDIS</strong></p>\n<p>In Cambodia, Uganda and Sierra Leone, conflict has led to changes in population demographics and hence household structures. The study explored the experiences of selected households that experienced loss or disability from past conflict of key members of their households and in what ways this influenced their lives, livelihoods, health and health care experiences.</p>\n<p>The impacts were gendered, with a disproportionate number of males dying from the direct violence of war, although the experience of abduction and amputation was experienced by both genders in Sierra Leone and Northern Uganda. Direct violence also led to disability and other trauma (both physical and mental).  Indirect impacts of conflict on health were also noted, caused - in part - by poor health infrastructure and failing or loss of livelihoods. </p>\n<p><strong>Thematic Working Group </strong><strong>on Health Systems in Fragile and Conflict Affected States</strong></p>\n<p>The work undertaken by the Thematic Working Group on Health Systems in Fragile and Conflict Affected States includes editing a special issue of <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Conflict and Health\"><em>Conflict and Health</em></a>: <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/Filling-the-void\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Filling the void\">“Filling the void: Health systems in fragile and conflict affected states\"</a>, which published 16 papers in 2014-15, and is establishing a resource repository of relevant research studies and practice guidelines, as well as two key issue guides in collaboration with <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.eldis.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ELDIS\">ELDIS</a> hosted by the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ids.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IDS\">Institute of Development Studies</a>, UK.</p>\n<p>Find out more about the Thematic Working Group on Health Systems in Fragile and Conflict Affected States over on the main <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://rebuildconsortium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ReBUILD Consortium TWG FCAS\">ReBUILD </a>website.</p>"
