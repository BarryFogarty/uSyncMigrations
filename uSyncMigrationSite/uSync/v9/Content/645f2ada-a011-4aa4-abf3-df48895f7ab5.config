      <Value><![CDATA[<p>As is the current practice in a number of Universities across Scotland and the rest of the UK, attendance registration will be carried out in relation to the University’s Student Attendance Policy and has been implemented with the direct support of the Students’ Union. Attending classes timetabled in your Programme of study is a vital part of student engagement – students who attend have consistently been shown to achieve better exit grades than those whose attendance record is below what is expected of QMU students.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding attendance registration at QMU, or you are concerned about your own attendance and want to know more about support that is available, please contact us at <a href="mailto:era@qmu.ac.uk">ERA@qmu.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The University also has to report details of all student attendance to the Scottish Funding Council, Students Awards Agency for Scotland, Student Loans Company and to advise the UK Visas and Immigration/Home Office when Tier4 sponsored overseas students are not in full attendance. It is therefore very important that we record student attendance across the University, and the electronic registration system based on your Student Smartcard helps us to do this effectively.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
<p>All new and returning taught students (undergraduate and postgraduate) must use their Student Smartcard to register their attendance with the Smartcard readers each time they enter a timetabled teaching or learning event as per their personalised timetable available in the Student Portal. The Smartcard readers are usually located near the door in each classroom, so on entering each session you must pass your card across the reader.</p>
<p>There are two different types of reader; one which flashes red/green the other simply flashes green. Both register attendance if a card is swiped over them.</p>
<p>There is a 30-minute time window during which you must present your card to the relevant electronic reader; 15 minutes before and up until 15 minutes after the start of class. It is therefore extremely important that you arrive as close to the start time as possible.</p>
<p>Electronic attendance registration will work in conjunction with the personalised timetable system. Your personalised timetable is available in the Student Portal. Every time you swipe, you are providing information to the system about your location at a particular time. This is then matched against the event in your timetable that you are scheduled to attend at that time. It will be extremely important for you to attend the teaching and learning events on your timetable.<strong> If you do not attend the class you have been assigned to in your personalised timetable, this will be recorded as unauthorised absence.</strong></p>
<p>Should you have difficulty attending particular events on your personalised timetable please contact <a href="mailto:ERA@qmu.ac.uk">ERA@qmu.ac.uk</a> for advice.</p>
<p>You will also be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifying the <span style="font-size: 14px;">Academic Administration </span>Administrators of any absences you may have (Automated online student absence forms can be found in your Student Portal.)</li>
<li>Keeping track of your attendance through the Student Portal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Responding promptly to any correspondence from the University regarding absence. Notifying the Academic Administration (via <a href="mailto:AcademicAdministration@qmu.ac.uk">Academic Administration</a>) about any classes you are having difficulty attending due to other commitments (such as childcare arrangements, part time work, etc.). While it is not guaranteed that these responsibilities can be accommodated, every effort will be made to move you to a different timeslot where possible.</strong></p>
