      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">About you</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Tell us a little about yourself such as your hobbies/interests that are related or not related to your course of study.</span></p>
<p>I am passionate about business, and I enjoy learning about successful people who’ve established their own companies.</p>
<p>I am also interested in arts, festival and cultural events, and other creative things. I think life is an adventure, and I love spiritual learning, like meditation, to find my own inner power. I would love to be a life mentor.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study at QMU and what attracted you to the course?</span></p>
<p>QMU encourages students to apply theory into real projects, so the chance to undertake a placement to learn and reflect really appealed to me.</p>
<p>Also, I learned that many of the students on this course are from all across the world, which would let me experience different cultures.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh?</span></p>
<p>Edinburgh is a beautiful, historical city, and the environment itself is suitable for students who study such subjects like arts, history and heritage, festival and culture.</p>
<p>The cost of living here is also considerably lower than other UK cities, like London, for example.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">The Course</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What did you most enjoy about your course? What was the highlight?</span></p>
<p>The programme contains many practical business elements. It develops and then assesses knowledge, skills and use of tools for strategic planning, financial management, marketing, fundraising, governance and people management - all of which have prepared me well for starting and running a sustainable business.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How did your lecturers support your learning?</span></p>
<p>Whether asking questions in classes or by email, academic staff were very supportive and helpful. My PAT [Personal Academic Tutor] gave me great support, too.</p>
<p>What were some of your challenges with the course and university life? How did you overcome them?</p>
<p>The language barrier and culture change were a bit of a shock. I could not understand 100% of what was said in classes, so writing essays was a good way to review my learning, and the required reading helped me to digest the material. When I did not understand something, I spoke up and asked for help and I would receive it.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you take part in a placement as part of your course and if so, what was your experience?</span></p>
<p>My placement was such wonderful experience. I worked with a local market owner to organise events, such as Chinese New Year celebrations and a fashion show.</p>
<p>I also learned how to play a key role in coordinating events with local people. From those experiences, I became one of the members of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce Scotland, and together we organized the 2016 Taiwanese Cultural and Food Fair to promote Taiwanese culture.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></p>
<p>I would recommend that students have some real-life work experience before undertaking this course. That experience will be helpful in order to better understand how to apply the theoretical knowledge in a real work setting.</p>
<p>If you are an international student, work hard on your English language skills.</p>
<p>Also, don’t be afraid in an unfamiliar environment. Embrace every challenge and try new things.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">Enhancing our student learning and personal development</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you join any schemes/initiatives to enhance your learning and development such as a mentoring or volunteering scheme?</span></p>
<p>As I mentioned, I joined the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce Scotland, and I also worked with our embassy closely to help with the delivery of some official events, like the Double Ten Festival. I also took the opportunity to meet arts organisations from Taiwan during Edinburgh Fringe festival, and supported them with the promotion of their shows.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">Life as a Student at QMU</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">What’s your ‘top tip’ for making the most of being a student?</span></p>
<p>Enjoying everything that comes with being a student!</p>
<p><span class="lead">What has been the most valuable lesson that you learned at university?</span></p>
<p>Take the time to reflect on what you’ve achieved. It’s been a fantastic experience for me, learning new knowledge and skills, and to look at what I want for myself in the future.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">After graduation</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Can you tell us more about what you’ve gone on to do following graduation? </span></p>
<p>I came to Edinburgh to pursue my master’s degree and fell in love with this ancient city. I got engaged, and while in Edinburgh we organised our “pre-wedding” photograph (like an engagement photo-shoot). However, I discovered it was very hard to find something suitable for Chinese couples, such as wedding dresses, photographers, makeup artists and so forth.</p>
<p>Chinese people love to travel overseas to take photos for their wedding album, so I recognised that there was a gap in the market for this kind of service.</p>
<p>After graduation, I met a Chinese business incubator who works at an Edinburgh university. By chance, she told me about an opportunity to apply for a Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur) visa to be able to start my business in UK. That’s how my business - <a href="https://www.ohpromise.com/">OHPROMISE LTD.</a> - was born.</p>
<p>OHPROMISE LTD. is the first Asian wedding brand established in Scotland. A group of professionals that are energetic, professional and creative, we provide customised and unique pre-wedding photography, wedding videography, planning, commercial film, wedding dresses, etc.</p>
<p>I believe my experiences, including postgraduate study at QMU, have equipped me with essential entrepreneurial skills for my own business, like through my previous jobs and post-graduate study at QMU.</p>
