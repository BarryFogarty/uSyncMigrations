      <Value><![CDATA[<p>“Carrots”, a word that to you might connote things relating to the colour or taste of this vegetable, but to me it is a word that sounds like an alarm in a fever dream. Why? Americans love to hear the thick Scottish accent of the word “karit”. I had a string of cafeteria workers at Slippery Rock University who jumped at the chance to serve me on carrot days. It was all in good fun and near the end of my stay I made really good friends and was even on first named basis with many of the workers.</p>
<p>I choose to go on an Exchange abroad for a few reasons. The main being it was a once in a lifetime experience, secondly, I finally got to submerge myself in the American way of life and the college experience and lastly, I got six months off work! I chose Slippery Rock because the name intrigued me and after much research into the school, I learned that the “small” intimate school meant that the school offered a lot of support in every aspect during your education.</p>
<p>Slippery Rock University is the epitome of small-town America, everyone knew everyone which meant making friends was extremely easy. Everyone was extremely friendly which defied my expectations even in the notorious New York city. Classes were also very interesting and very niche. The professors were extremely passionate during class time which made learning fun. The work-load was easy to stay on top off if scheduled properly which meant I had a lot of free time attending basketball games, gaining weight by eating a lot of chicken wings, going to frat events and exploring the city when the polar vortex blew over.</p>
<p>Overall, if giving the chance to study abroad don’t pass it up. I managed to budget over half a year and had plenty to last. The friendships are for a lifetime as well as the experience. Just remember don’t leave your visa until the last week like I did, it will say you a lot of stress.</p>]]></Value>
