      <Value><![CDATA[<p class="txtMainBlack">Before coming to live in Scotland in 2016, Ming Ming was a part-time teaching assistant in a secondary school in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Ming Ming is also a marketing assistant for a company called Aero Institute in Hong Kong, where she translates the official company website from English into traditional and simplified Chinese, as well as writing blogs promoting the company in Career Times Hong Kong twice a month.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Why did you choose to study BSc (Hons) Business Management at QMU?</strong></p>
<p>“I’m a Translation student at Hong Kong Baptist University, where I’m specialising in English-Chinese translation and interpretation.</p>
<p>“I chose to study BSc (Hons) Business Management at QMU because I’m interested in the global scope and impact of business and commerce. To be successful in this industry and appeal to a diverse international market, you need good communication skills. Specialist knowledge in translation and interpretation is also required for effective media and business management.</p>
<p>“I chose QMU as my host institution because of its international reputation for academic excellence and good graduate employment rates in a variety of sectors.”</p>
<p>“My career interests are focused on business and media. I’ve already taken introductory courses in my home institution, including business law and translating across media. I hope the modules I’ve taken at QMU could give me a deeper understanding of business and media, which will help me in my future career as a translator, interpreter or public relations professional.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh/Scotland?</strong></p>
<p>“Edinburgh as the Scottish capital is renowned not only as a centre of commerce, but also for its rich history and culture. The city is home to countless historical attractions, libraries and theatres, which is enhancing my exchange experience. It also offers a great opportunity for me to meet new friends with different cultural backgrounds from all over the world.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>How do you find the workload? </strong></p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>“</strong>I think the workload is about the right amount. It’s not as much as I find in Hong Kong, but most courses emphasise self-learning, which requires students to be self-disciplined. Pre-study and revision after class is important.</p>
<p>“Academic staff at QMU are really friendly and helpful. They give me relevant and quick support whenever I need help.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>How do you think your QMU degree has equipped you with the skills/knowledge to development your career?</strong></p>
<p>“So far I’ve taken modules in business economics, finance and accounting, management, marketing and event management. These modules are equipping me with the basic knowledge of business and management, which I could make good use of in my future business translations and interpretation.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>What are your top tips for prospective students based on your own personal experience? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Be self-disciplined and attend all classes and seminars. Pre-study and after class revision are also important for self-learning.</li>
<li class="txtMainBlack">Be independent. It’s not easy to live alone in another country. Life skills such as cooking and taking good care of yourself are important.</li>
<li class="txtMainBlack">Be sociable. Try to make more friends from other countries and with different backgrounds.</li>
<li class="txtMainBlack">Have good time management. If you need to work during the course, you need to manage your time well.</li>
<li class="txtMainBlack">Explore the local area and take the opportunity to plan weekend trips to different cities in Scotland, the rest of the UK and Europe.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="txtMainBlack"><strong>What are your plans after graduation?</strong></p>
<p>“I still have one year of study in Hong Kong after I finish my exchange year at QMU. I will graduate from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2018 with a BA degree in Translation.</p>
<p>“I’m currently searching for government summer internships where I can specialise in business, media and translation. I’m also planning to find a part-time internship during my final year study in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“I have two plans after graduation. I’d either apply for government jobs or continue a master’s degree in translation or business in the UK or Hong Kong.”</p>
