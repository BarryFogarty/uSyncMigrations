      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Flexible courses designed for practitioners who want to make a difference in the allied health professions, nursing, nutrition, medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, public health etc</strong></p>
<p>In 2019 we launched our flexible, multi-professional and practice relevant postgraduate Advancing Practice in Health Framework. The framework will be attractive to individuals who want to make a difference to the lives of others locally, nationally and globally. It will be of interest to any individual working in a health-related field such as allied health professionals, nurses, nutritionists, other professionals such as medical practitioners, pharmacists, dentists, and those working in areas such as public health, the community and the voluntary sector. We also welcome enquiries from other interested individuals including international applicants.</p>
<p>The framework aims to foster and develop QMU’s mission of cultivating intellectual capital with both a theoretical and practical focus. Learning and teaching is underpinned by research, evidence and scholarship against the background of current and evolving political and social landscape for health and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Aligned to the four pillars of advanced practice</strong></p>
<p>The framework is based on a model of collaborative multi-professional learning aligned to expectations of the four pillars of advanced practice (Clinical Practice, Leadership, Education and Research). There are learning opportunities in areas such as fundamentals of advancing practice, critical analysis, evaluation and research methodologies, as well as a number of more specific modules. The framework also draws on expertise across the University on subjects such as leadership, social science and education.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Benefit from a personalised learning pathway</span></p>
<p>At QMU we recognise that career opportunities transform over time. In response to this we can facilitate a personalised learning pathway that can lead to PgCert/ PgDip/ MSc Advancing Practice in Health awards. This may be of particular interest to those who already hold a master’s award or wish to study modules in a particular area or pillar of practice.</p>
<p>As part of the framework we also offer the following named awards:</p>
