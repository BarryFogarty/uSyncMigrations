      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Megan Richardson, 22 from Monkrigg Steading in Haddington, graduated from QMU with a BSc (Hons) Podiatry.</p>
<p>Megan, who is known in the county as a former international level badminton player, was in good company at QMU’s graduation ceremony, which was held last week at Edinburgh’s Usher Hall. She was joined by the TV presenter and food entrepreneur, Prue Leith CBE, who was officially installed as the University’s new Chancellor, and the Hollywood film producer, Iain Smith, who received an honorary degree for services to the film industry. Megan's mother Ann and father David watched with pride as their daughter took to the stage to be capped by the new Chancellor. Megan’s fiancé Barrie also joined them for the ceremony and for the celebrations back on campus.</p>
<p>When Megan first came to QMU, she had been playing badminton at junior international level. She said: “I was rather anxious as to how I would fit in living at home and having minimal time on campus. However, the small class sizes and the support and encouragement of my lecturers and personal academic tutor meant I was able to achieve my grades, enjoy my classes and still compete.”</p>
<p>She continued: “In 3<sup>rd</sup> year, I had to stop competing due to injury and so I became more involved in the sports and societies on campus and fully embraced my time at University – if it wasn’t for this, I wouldn’t be in the fantastic position I am today.”</p>
<p>Despite graduating, Megan will not be leaving QMU. She has been voted in to serve for a second term in office as the Student Vice President of the Students’ Union – so 2017 will be her 6<sup>th</sup> year at the East Lothian university.</p>
<p>Megan confirmed:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="I love every single minute of being able to work with the amazing students of QMU. My time at QMU has provided me with not only an Honours Degree, but the best student experience possible, a course of study which I wouldn’t change for the world and university life that I’ll always remember." source="Megan Richardson" sourceExtra="" />
