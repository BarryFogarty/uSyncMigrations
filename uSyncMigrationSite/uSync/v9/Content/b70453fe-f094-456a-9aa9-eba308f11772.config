Why did you choose to study at QMU and what attracted you to the course? 

I decided to study at QMU because the course was accredited with the Chartered Institute of Management Accounting (CIMA). I also chose the University as I was aware of the Programme Leader's expertise in the field and her reputation for being a great lecturer. 

Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh? 

I wanted to study in Edinburgh as it is a world-leading location in Asset Management and Investment. 

What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been your highlight? 

I enjoyed the broad context of finance and the current business subjects shown in the news and how they are related to finance as this demonstrated the implementation of the theory that we had learned. 

Any advice for students who might be interested in this course? 

My advice would be to try and get some financial experience before starting the course and read broadly to prep your understanding of what is happening in the current economic environment. 

Have you joined any schemes/initiatives to enhance your learning and development? 

I have been involved in the Employer Mentoring Programme and had the opportunity to represent the University at an international conference in Switzerland. 

Have you won any awards, scholarships or internships? 

I am a Rocco Forte, Moffat and HIT scholar. 

What's your 'top tip' for making the most of being a student? 

Take every opportunity possible and enjoy yourself as these will be the best times of your life! 

What has been the most valuable thing that you've learned at university? 

Time management skills, but also confidence in myself and my abilities. 

What are your plans after graduation?  

After graduation, I hope to be able to work in financial strategy or business consultancy.]]></Value>
