    "content": "<p>Section four of the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/76e1fcaba073450ab7d398fbc93e064a}\" title=\"Academic Appeals Regulations\">Academic Appeals Regulations</a> details what can, and cannot, be used as grounds for appeal. Relevant extracts have been provided below.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 Grounds of Additional Information</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"4.1.1 additional information is available that was not, and could not, reasonably have been made available to the Board at the time it made its original decision and which had it been available could have led the Board to making a different decision (see also 4.3 below);</em></p>\n<p><em>4.2 A student may NOT appeal on grounds which:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>could have been considered by the Board of Examiners had notice been given prior to the meeting; and</em></li>\n<li><em>the student has no valid reason for having failed to give such notice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>4.3 References in 4.1 and 4.2 to information available to the Board of Examiners include recommendations on student cases made by the Extenuating Circumstances Panel (EC Panel). Appeals on the grounds of extenuating circumstances will not be accepted where there is evidence that the circumstances that form the basis of the submission could have been submitted to the EC Panel by the published deadline, and the student has no grounds for not submitting by that deadline.\"</em></p>\n<p>Key points:</p>\n<p>This ground for appeal is open to students who have valid extenuating circumstances but, for one or more reasons, were unable to notify the Board of Examiners through the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/bf490cabaf4f4791ac49cd1dc71cb241}\" title=\"Extenuating Circumstances\">Extenuating Circumstances process</a>.</p>\n<p>Appeals submitted on this ground should therefore include an explanation as to why an extenuating circumstances claim was not made.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Grounds of Material Irregularity</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"4.1.2 there was a material irregularity in the procedures of the Board of Examiners or in the conduct of the assessment.\"</em></p>\n<p>A material irregularity in the conduct of assessment is where an issue has, or issues have, adversely affected your ability to complete your assessment. For example, an error made by a member of University staff, or disruption to an assessment caused by a third party.</p>\n<p>A material irregularity in the procedures of the Board of Examiners is where the Board has taken a decision that is not consistent with the University’s regulations, or has taken a decision that was based on incorrect information.</p>\n<p>Key points:</p>\n<p>If you think there has been an error in the way your work was assessed, tell the relevant module coordinator as soon as possible, and ideally before the Board of Examiners meets. If an error is confirmed, it may be possible for staff to rectify or mitigate the error without going through the formal appeals process.</p>\n<p>If you think there is a material irregularity in the procedures of the Board of Examiners, are you able to evidence that the Board of Examiners has taken a decision that was not consistent with the University’s regulations, or has taken a decision that was based on incorrect information?</p>\n<p><strong>2.3 Academic Judgement</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"4.4 A student’s disagreement with the academic judgement of a Board of Examiners does not provide a valid ground for appeal.\"</em></p>\n<p>The Office of the Independent Adjudicator, the independent student complaints scheme for England and Wales, defines academic judgement as follows:</p>\n<p>“Academic judgment is not any judgment made by an academic; it is a judgment that is made about a matter where the opinion of an academic expert is essential. So for example a judgment about marks awarded, degree classification, research methodology, whether feedback is correct or adequate, and the content or outcomes of a course will normally involve academic judgment.”</p>\n<p>The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO), the final stage for complaints about public service organisations in Scotland, cannot investigate matters related to the exercise of academic judgement.</p>\n<p>Key points:</p>\n<p>You cannot submit an academic appeal because you believe you should have been awarded a better mark. Section five of the University’s <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2dcd33d7240d4ed789ae987c43c85822}\" title=\"General Assessment Regulations\">Assessment Regulations</a> sets out how the University seeks to ensure the fairness, reliability and validity of assessment.</p>\n<p>If you are not sure why you received a particular outcome or mark, you should inform the module coordinator who may be able to provide additional feedback to help you understand the result. Alternatively, your Personal Academic Tutor may be approached for advice.</p>"
