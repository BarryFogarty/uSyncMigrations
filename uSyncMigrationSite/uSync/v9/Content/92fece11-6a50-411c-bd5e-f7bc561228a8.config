<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead-big">What is hybrid working?</span><br />At QMU we define hybrid working as an informal and variable working arrangement where, within agreed parameters, a member of staff works some of their time at home, or at another agreed remote location, and some of their time on campus. Patterns of hybrid work may vary from week to week and month to month in response to the variable nature of the work people will undertake over the course of any given year.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">Why is the University introducing a Hybrid Working Statement now?</span><br />We wish to retain the positive aspects of remote working we have seen during the Covid-19 pandemic and support staff to achieve an appropriate balance of remote and on campus working, in accordance with our Statement of Requirement and Supporting Principles.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">Does hybrid working apply to all roles at the University?</span><br />The vast majority of roles at the University are eligible for some form of hybrid working. However, there are a limited number of roles where an on campus presence is required. These role may still be suited to occasional working from home to complete some tasks, for example, online training.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">How will I know if my role is eligible for hybrid working?</span><br />Your manager will confirm to you whether your role is suitable for hybrid working or not. Chances are if you have been working in a hybrid way already your role is eligible. Managers are strongly encouraged to hold team meetings to discuss the University’s recently published Hybrid Working Statement and talk about how hybrid working will be managed within the team going forward. Further details are available from the Hybrid Working Manager Guidance.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">I prefer to work on campus, is this ok?</span><br />Yes. Hybrid working is optional and staff may choose to work solely on campus if they wish.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">How many hours a week do I need to be on campus?</span><br />The University has no set minimum number of hours for working on campus, decisions regarding hybrid working patterns are determined locally, you should talk your line manager and your team about what works best for your key stakeholders, your team and yourself.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">My role is eligible for hybrid working, will I be able to work from home the same day(s) every week?</span><br />Hybrid working is informal and variable and it will not be possible to provide fixed patterns. If you need to work from home on specific days then you can make a request for a contractual change via the University’s Flexible Working Policy.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">Can I be asked by my manager to come onto campus at short notice when I had planned to work from home?</span><br />Hybrid working is variable and as such there may be occasions where your presence on campus is required at short notice. When these situations arise your manager will do their best to provide you with as much notice as possible however you should retain the availability and ability to work fully on campus if required.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">My role is eligible for hybrid working, can I work remotely from abroad for the majority of the time?</span><br />No. For the vast majority of QMU staff our campus in Musselburgh is the contractual place of work.</p>
<p>QMU is unable to accommodate or comply with requests to work remotely while abroad. This is because working from abroad entails complex issues covering immigration; local employment law and health and safety law; local income tax and social security payments; some UK pension rules; corporate tax issues; data protection and intellectual property issues. If you wish to work remotely while abroad on a short-term, temporary basis this must be discussed with your line manager in the first instance, who will need to take specialist advice via HR, before approval can be given, as this may still give rise to local immigration, tax and social security issues.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">I have agreed hybrid working with my manager, will this be taken into account for timetabling purposes?</span><br />No. Hybrid working is informal and variable and is non contractual. Currently, as per Timetabling Policy, only formal flexible working agreements are considered when the timetable is being developed. If you need to work from home on specific days then you can make a request for a contractual change via the University’s Flexible Working Policy.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">I have a disability which means I will need adjustments to work in a hybrid way, what support is available?</span><br />Please make contact with your HR Partner who can offer further advice and support for your individual circumstances.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">If I am clinically extremely vulnerable, am I required to work on campus and what support is available to me?</span><br />The Highest Risk List (previously Clinically Extremely Vulnerable) ended on 31 May 2022 and you can now go into the workplace, unless advised otherwise by your GP or healthcare clinician. However, you are still recommended to follow ‘<a href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" title="Covid Sense Guidance">covid sense</a>’.</p>
<p>You may continue to feel more cautious or anxious about your health and wellbeing in the workplace and we would recommend you discuss these concerns openly with your line manager. Further support, if required, can be obtained from your HR partner and/or Health, Safety and Wellbeing team.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead-big">What advice is available to support my health and wellbeing?</span></p>
<p>Guidance and contacts can be found on the Human Resources and <a href="/study-here/student-services/wellbeing-service/" title="Health, Safety and Wellbeing Intranet Site">Health, Safety and Wellbeing</a> Intranet sites.<br /><br /><a href="/study-here/student-services/wellbeing-service/" title="Wellbeing Service">Guidance on the health and wellbeing advice and support</a> is available to all staff.<br /><br />Where support is required, staff are encouraged to discuss their individual circumstances with their manager in the first instance, and then managers or staff can contact their HR Partner for further support.<br /><br />Stress has a direct link to overall health and wellbeing. All staff have access to the <a href="https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/human-resources/SitePages/eLearning.aspx" title="Stress Management at QMU e-learning module">‘Stress Management at QMU’ e-learning module</a>, which contains valuable hints and tips for managing stress, along with useful resources for wellbeing.</p>
<p>Staff can also utilise our <a href="https://myshare.qmu.ac.uk/services/human-resources/SitePages/Employee%20Assistance%20Programme%20-%20Be%20Supported.aspx" title="Employee Assistance Programme">Employee Assistance Programme</a> for external and independent advice and support.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">If I require any equipment such as a desk or chair to work remotely at home, how do I request these?</span> <br />It is the responsibility of the member of staff to ensure that, when not working on campus, they have a suitable environment in which to work. The University will not normally provide equipment for working remotely such as a desk or chair, except where equipment is required as part of a reasonable adjustment for disability.</p>
<p><span class="lead-big">Has the University carried out an Equality Impact Assessment of the Hybrid Working Statement?</span><br />Yes and we have consulted our campus Trade Union regarding this. The Equality Impact Assessment is available to all staff to read.</p>]]></Value>
