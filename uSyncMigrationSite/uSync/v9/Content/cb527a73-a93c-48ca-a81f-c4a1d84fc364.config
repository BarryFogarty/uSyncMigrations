It is designed to support practitioners to develop and advance their practice across a variety of contexts. The course highlights the transformational role of education that will equip occupational therapists to develop and promote sustainable and progressive practice.</p>\n<p>As a student on this course you will develop your knowledge of the evidence-base for/of practice and deepen your critical thinking, professional reasoning and research skills.</p>\n<p>The MSc Advancing Practice in Occupational Therapy is embedded as an integrated pathway on our <a href=\"/study-here/how-to-apply/person-centred-practice-framework/\"><strong>Person-Centred Practice Framework</strong></a>, which affords equal attention to both the philosophy of occupation and of person-centredness. This Framework offers a student-centred approach to education, fostered through three approaches to learning: experiential and collaborative learning, critical discourse and evidence-based teaching.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the course aims to ensure the centrality of occupation as part of therapists’ postgraduate education and, in so doing, responds to the strategic drivers for change towards advanced and person-centred practice in global health and social care. Educationally, it will address philosophical concepts from occupational science and person-centred practice that will be blended throughout the programme to facilitate learning at master’s level.</p>"
