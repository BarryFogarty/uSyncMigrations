    "content": "<p>Dietetics is the management of diseases that are amenable to dietary intervention, and the prevention of nutrition-related disorders. A dietitian influences food selection and eating behaviour of an individual based on specific nutritional or food requirements.</p>\n<p>As a dietitian, you will translate scientific information about nutrition into practical advice to help people make health-conscious decisions about food. You will assess, diagnose and treat diet-related problems and aim to raise awareness of the link between food, health and disease to prevent future problems and treat existing nutrition-related problems. Dietitians are a key part of the healthcare team and are the only nutrition professionals to be statutorily regulated.</p>\n<p>The course takes you through a clinically and practically focused study of disease, health, food and nutrition. With a clinical and health promotion focus, the course includes three practice-based placements that allow students to apply and consolidate their theoretical learning.</p>"

Learning activities include lectures, tutorials, workshops and practical classes and are guided using web-based supporting materials. You will also complete three practical placements to enable the integration of theoretical knowledge with practical experience.</p>\n<p>A variety of assessment methods are used across the course. A small cohort ensures that individuals receive excellent support and benefit from sharing their experiences with classmates.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>You will complete three periods of placement.
