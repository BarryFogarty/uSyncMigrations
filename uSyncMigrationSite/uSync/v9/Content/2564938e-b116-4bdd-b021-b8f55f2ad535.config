In the event of a positive response, the process set out in 2.3 below will be followed.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Any student who is subsequently found to have falsified his/her self declaration will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>2.3          Where an applicant or a matriculating student has declared a criminal conviction, identified staff of the University Secretary’s Group will contact the applicant or student to ascertain the nature of the conviction, requesting further information, including the nature of the conviction, date of conviction, nature of sentence etc. The Head of Admissions, the relevant School Manager and the relevant Head of Division will review this information and carry out a risk assessment using an established classification taken from the Health and Care Professions Council. The following criteria will be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programme requirements</li>\n<li>Potential risk to other students and staff</li>\n<li>Responsibilities to employers and the public</li>\n<li>The rights of the individual and entitlement to rehabilitation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Serious cases may also be referred to the Dean for academic consideration.</p>\n<p>2.4          The University Secretary will consider the recommendation from the risk assessment and will make a decision on admittance to, or continuation on, a programme.</p>\n<p>2.5          Students will not be permitted to commence placements until the investigation into the criminal conviction has concluded.</p>\n<p>2.6          Any appeal against a decision in this matter will be conducted through the established University procedures. In certain circumstances, the institution may have to refer cases to the relevant statutory body.</p>\n<p>2.7         All Professionally qualifying programmes at QMU have a requirement for students to be screened through the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) process, via Disclosure Scotland.  The Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme delivers on the provisions outlined in the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of the QMU programmes which require a Disclosure Scotland check.

In the normal course of events, students will be required to apply for “Standard Disclosure” before entry to a programme. The existence of a criminal record itself does not mean that a student is unable to join a course, but admission to particular courses may precluded by certain types of convictions.</p>"

    "title": "Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)",
    "content": "<p>3.1    Individual students may be admitted to an advanced stage of a programme, provided that they have demonstrably reached the same general standard of educational development as achieved through earlier level(s) of the programme. There should also be a reasonable probability that prospective students will complete the programme successfully within its normal duration. Where other studies are used as the basis for selection, the Programme Leader or Admissions Tutor will have discretion to determine if it is necessary for each component in the omitted level(s) of the programme to be shown to have been covered.</p>\n<p>3.2   Where admission to a level has been granted, students may further apply for specific credits as set out below. However, any credit approved under RPL and based on a specific episode of prior learning can be used only once on any programme of study.</p>\n<p>3.3    The <strong>R</strong>ecognition of <strong>P</strong>rior <strong>L</strong>earning (RPL) describes the use of prior learning, either as a formative tool as part of personal development or as a summative tool for the award of credit. The learning may have taken place either as part of a formal educational course or as part of an informal life or work experience outside formal educational settings. This acknowledges that there may be a stage of discussion, reflection and formative assignments, prior to any formal application for the accreditation of prior learning.</p>\n<p>3.4    The Recognition of <strong>P</strong>rior <strong>L</strong>earning (RPL) refers to the process whereby students are awarded credit towards an award on the basis of previous learning, which may be either certificated learning or experiential learning.</p>\n<p>3.5     RPL can be used either as a means of demonstrating the achievement of entry level or for gaining credit that can be transferred as either general or specific credit towards a programme of study.</p>\n<p>3.6    The application will be assessed by the University in terms of its:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authenticity - that the applicant actually completed what is claimed.</li>\n<li>directness - that the learning was specific and can be identified and categorised.</li>\n<li>sufficiency - that learning reached a level to allow the applicant to fulfil the learning outcomes of the programme.</li>\n<li>currency - that the learning is sufficiently recent to allow the applicant to fulfil learning outcomes of the programme.  Where experience from some time previously is referred to in a substantial way, e.g. more than five years has elapsed, the application will be assessed to determine whether the applicant has kept up to date with recent developments in the intended field of study.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.7   The Recognition of Prior Certificated Learning (RPCL) refers to the recognition of prior learning gained from a formal course that has been previously assessed and/or accredited at higher education level.</p>\n<p>3.8   The Recognition of Prior Experiential Learning (RPEL) refers to the process of assessing and credit-rating learning achieved outside formal education settings.</p>\n<p>3.9    The minimum credit that can be awarded is 5 credits in the case of undergraduate Programmes, and 7.5 credits for postgraduate programmes. For the purpose of awarding credit, smaller volumes of learning may be incorporated into a single summative assessment submitted for the award of credit.</p>\n<p>3.10    The University will grant specific credit to students by matching evidence provided by the student which demonstrates that they have fulfilled the learning outcomes of specified full modules in a validated programme on which they are registered.   Students given specific credit for a module will then be exempted from this module and prohibited from undertaking a similar module.</p>\n<p>3.11    Students may possess general credit awarded by other institutions for previous studies.  Part of these studies may be specifically recognised and given specific credit towards a programme of the University on the basis that they meet the requirements of a Queen Margaret University award.</p>\n<p>3.12    The level and volume of general credit should be assessed based on the relevant level descriptors of the SCQF. Although  the volume of credit is not a simple mathematical judgement, one credit point is approximately equivalent to 10 hours of learning, including all learning activities, application through work based activity, reflection and assessment.</p>\n<p>3.13    Students may be exempted from attendance in respect of part of a module where they can demonstrate prior learning of some but not all of the learning outcomes of that module. In such circumstances, students will be summatively assessed against the learning outcomes of the full module.</p>\n<p>3.14    The only exception is where a programme option or elective exists.  Specific credit can be given on the basis of previous learning without precise matching of module learning outcomes, provided that students achieve the overall outcomes for an award.</p>\n<p>3.15    The student’s claim for credit for a specific module may be assessed in a number of possible ways, and in the following order of preference. The student can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide evidence of passing an equivalent module elsewhere;</li>\n<li>undertake the normal module assessment;</li>\n<li>undertake an oral examination;</li>\n<li>undertake another form of assessment, e.g. a challenge essay;</li>\n<li>complete an approved learning contract;</li>\n<li>submit a portfolio of</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.16    Where credit is awarded, it should be for evidence of the achievement of learning arising from the experience and not for the experience alone.</p>\n<p>3.17     A student’s claim for credit for a specific module should be assessed by the same staff member who would normally assess performance on that module, unless that member of staff has previously acted as academic advisor to the student.</p>\n<p>3.18     The record of the assessment of prior learning should be open to independent scrutiny by the same external examiners who assess performance on the specific modules or academic award.  The evidence submitted by students of prior experiential learning in support of a claim must be available for scrutiny by external examiners.  Boards of Examiners should be notified of those credits on student transcripts arising from RPL.</p>\n<p>3.19     At least 50 per cent of the level at which a student enters a programme must be completed at Queen Margaret University in order to gain an award from the University.  Classification of awards may make use of grades given for prior learning: for RPCL, those grades are those given by the institution where the prior learning was accredited (adjusted to allow for differences in marking criteria); for RPEL, those grades may be given by Queen Margaret University.</p>\n<p>3.20     As part of its programme review and annual monitoring processes, QMU may require programme teams to monitor, review and report on their use of the policies and procedures for RPL.</p>\n<p>3.21      An approved learning contract may be used by a student to gain credit, based on an agreed piece of current independent learning. The credit gained may be general or specific. Learning contracts may be incorporated into individual or independent study modules.</p>\n<p>3.22    Where a learning contract is used for the award of specific credit, the contract should indicate how the specific learning outcomes of the module(s) are to be demonstrated.</p>\n<p>3.23    Where a learning contract is used for general credit, the choice of learning outcomes, together with the volume and level of credit should be made with reference to the SCQF framework.</p>\n<p>3.24    A learning contract should include statements of: the level and volume of credit, the aims and learning outcomes, a plan of activities, details of evidence to be submitted by the student (report, essay, video, portfolio etc.), a marking scheme and a time plan.</p>\n<p>3.25    The contract should be dated and signed by the student, the lecturer supervising the student and the programme leader (plus the representative of any external body in the case of work-based learning). A copy of the learning contract, together with the student work and marking sheet, should be made available to the External Examiner.</p>\n<p>3.26    Boards of Examiners should be made aware of any marks/grades arising from learning contracts.</p>\n<p>3.27   General credit may be awarded to students who can demonstrate learning through their fulfilment of a formal representative role in QMU, such as that of a student representative, or as a participant in a programme planning committee or review / validation event.</p>\n<p>3.28    In order to gain credit for a representative role, students must agree a learning contract with the relevant Programme Leader or Head of Division and completed in accordance with section 3.21-3.26 above.</p>"

The fact that the student has not yet completed the maximum period of registration shall not, in itself, entitle him/her to remain registered.</p>\n<p>4.4      An award may be conferred subsequent to the expiry of the period of registration.</p>\n<p>4.5       A student may apply for deferment of study either prior to entry, or after commencement of studies. Application should be made to the Programme Leader.</p>\n<p>4.6       Once a student commences studies, deferment of studies will be permitted only where it remains possible for the student to obtain the relevant award within the maximum period of registration (see paragraph 4.1).</p>\n<p>4.7       Only in exceptional circumstances will a student be permitted to re-enrol on the programme. This includes students who have been required, or have chosen, to withdraw from a programme, and who have not been granted a deferment of study. Students who have voluntarily withdrawn may be re-admitted for a higher award through the University's normal admissions procedures. Students who have been required to withdraw may be re-admitted through the University's normal admissions procedures a minimum of one year after the decision of the Boards of Examiners. Students can only be considered for readmission where it is still possible for them to complete within the maximum period of registration and where the student has not already exhausted all possible attempts on a core module. Students who indicate that they wish to exit with an Ordinary degree should apply directly to the Head of Division if they subsequently wish to proceed to an Honours degree.</p>\n<p>4.8      Where the period of deferment of study begins during a level for which fees have been paid, no refund of such fees will normally be made.</p>\n<p> </p>"
