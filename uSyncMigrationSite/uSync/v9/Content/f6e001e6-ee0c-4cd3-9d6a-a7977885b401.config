    "content": "<p>The QMU Student Experience Strategy is concerned with the holistic student experience. This encompasses both the student learning experience, and aspects of the wider student experience that support and complement student learning. The Strategy is relevant for all of our students based in Edinburgh, as well as distance learning students and students at our partner institutions around the world.</p>\n<p>The Student Experience Strategy for the period 2021-2026 has been developed in partnership between the University and the Students’ Union, drawing on the outcome of consultation and co-creation with students and staff. Embracing and extending this ‘Students as Partners’ approach will be fundamental to our plans for implementation of the Strategy, and students and staff will work collectively to deliver this.</p>"

A prioritised Strategy Delivery Plan, will support the translation of strategy into practice. This will be iterated and monitored on an annual basis by the Student Experience Committee.</p>\n<p>As the infographic  shows, key areas of priority are presented under one of five action headings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The learner journey</li>\n<li>Employability, enterprise and entrepreneurship</li>\n<li>Quality enhancement</li>\n<li>Innovation in learning, teaching and assessment</li>\n<li>Healthy Universities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are supported by three overarching themes of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion; Students as Partners; and Sustainability and Social Justice that cut across the student experience during the period of Strategy. These themes are fundamental to the delivery of an outstanding student experience, and underpin all of our actions and activities.</p>"
