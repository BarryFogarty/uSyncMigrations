      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Were there any particular course activities you found especially interesting?</span> </p>
<p>I found Event Planning highly interesting, as it enabled me to implement various skills, including negotiating skills and portraying talent. A well-coordinated plan largely determines the success of an event, whether face-to-face, offline, virtual or hybrid. Though event planning can be challenging in terms of restrictive budgets, unforeseen circumstances and crises; I believe that as a strategic leader, one needs to be results driven with a creative vision so that an idea can be converted to reality; from the concept to execution.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span> </p>
<p>Queen Margaret University and the Institute of Technology and Management (ITM) have been in partnership since 2002. The programmes offered academic counselling to assist students with pathways in achieving personal and professional goals. Also, the Industry-Academia interface ensures the development of skills and support networks. Therefore, a degree programme in hospitality, tourism and the culinary arts is not just an international qualification but a global education.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Can you tell us about your life post-graduation?</span></p>
<p>A short while before I graduated, I started an entrepreneurial venture – the Quick Fix, which was purely operational through Instagram business platforms. Though having originally planned to pursue a postgraduate programme, one thing led to another, and I received an opportunity <br />to work on Television shows: 'India's 50 Best Dishes – Season 2' and 'Baker's Studio'. With every experience helping me explore new directions, I still wanted to pursue my passion as a Chef. I applied for the J-1 Internship and Training and am presently at the Royal Pacific Resort in Orlando, Florida, navigating a new chapter of my professional life.</p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study at one of QMU's collaborative partner institutions, and what attracted you to the course? </span></p>
<p>When the time came to choose an Institute to pursue a Degree Programme in Hospitality and the Culinary Arts, I identified ITM Institute of Hotel Management, Oshiwara and the collaboration with Queen Margaret University, Scotland. Upon further research, I found that the Institute prioritises real-world learning, is student-centred and relies on a career-focused approach to education. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What did you enjoy most about your course?</span> </p>
<p>The curriculum of the Bachelor of Arts in International Hospitality and Tourism intrigued me. The module-based learning of the third year was an integration of theory and practice. The use of an experiential approach by the module tutors often led to innovation and self-discovery, thus accelerating the learning process.</p>]]></Value>
