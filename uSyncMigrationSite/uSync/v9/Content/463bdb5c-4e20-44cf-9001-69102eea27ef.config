      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>Cycling Friendly Campus is a nationally recognised award that measures an organisation’s infrastructure to support people cycling, by looking at its facilities, staff and promotion of cycling support. QMU has been awarded a distinction by Cycling Scotland - the highest level possible for this award.</span> </p>
<p><span>Since its move to its new campus in Musselburgh in 2007, QMU has set out to embed sustainability in the everyday work of the University. One of its most noticeable initiatives has been its commitment to sustainable travel</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span> - in particular, cycling.</span> </p>
<p><span>QMU has put a wealth of resources into providing students and staff with the resources to cycle to campus. As well as multiple bike hire schemes, a cycle to work scheme and access to cycling infrastructure.</span> </p>
<p><span>Bruce Laing, Deputy Director of Campus Services at Queen Margaret University, said: “QMU offers a combination of infrastructure and behaviour change measures in order to support our staff, students and visitors to travel to campus in a sustainable way. With transport accounting for a third of Scotlands greehouse gas emissions, it is crucial for the university to ensure that alternatives to private car travel are accessible and encouraged.</span> </p>
<p><span>The University's Sustainable Transport Strategy, Green Travel Plan and it’s reinvestment of funds into sustainable travel projects ensure there is a clear priority towards reducing emissions and increasing access to sustainable modes of travel. </span> </p>
<p><span>It is encouraging to receive recognition for the continued hard work the transport team has put in over the past year and we look forward to continuing to offer bike hire schemes, a variety of events and cycle training for staff and students. </span> </p>
<p><span>Of course, all of this work requires organisation and QMU has a dedicated team of people to help promote cycling to campus. The Cycle Connections team both organise the various events and services offered by the University, but also act as the first port of call for anyone interested in taking up cycling.</span> </p>
<p><span>Serena Ozkan from Cycle Connections discussed the recent award. She said: “We got the distinction award, which is the highest available, and when we were taking the assessor through the campus, he said it was really impressive everything we do to support and promote cycling across the University community. </span> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="We are incredibly proud to receive a distinction from Cycling Scotland. It is incredibly important that the University helps promote as many people as possible to take sustainable ways to work and school. More than that, it’s about finding the joy in taking up cycling as a hobby - with all the mental and physical health benefits that come with it." source="Selena Ozkan" sourceExtra="" />
<p><span>“Awards like these help us know that the important work we do to support cycling at QMU is working and we are excited to expand on what we already offer and make it as easy as possible for people to start cycling to the campus.”</span> </p>]]></Value>
