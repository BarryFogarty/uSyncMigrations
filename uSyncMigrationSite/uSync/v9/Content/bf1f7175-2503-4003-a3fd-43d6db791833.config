      <Value><![CDATA[<p>There’s always something going on in Edinburgh, making it an exciting place in which to study and live. Each year, thousands of people descend on Edinburgh to live, work, study or visit on holiday. Edinburgh is abundant with things to see and do, and has often appeared in the top ten places to visit in the world. It has been listed as being a top place to live in the UK by public opinion surveys.</p>
<p>QMU is situated to the east of Edinburgh’s city centre, and offers students a friendly community atmosphere. Based at a purpose-built campus, which opened in late 2007, we pride ourselves on our supportive learning environment.</p>
<p>QMU has a growing and vibrant international community which is sure to enrich your student experience. We are keen to ensure that you are given a warm, friendly Scottish welcome. The size of the University allows us to offer an approachable, responsive and individual student experience.</p>
<p>Yeliz Cavrar joined QMU from our exchange partner Corvinus University of Budapest for one semester. <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/bd55567d9b0a42d69e6d8f1947d5bd7f}" title="Student Stories">Read about Yeliz's experience.</a></p>]]></Value>
