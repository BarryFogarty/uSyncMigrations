Our complaints procedure has two stages:</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Stage one – frontline resolution</span></p>\n<p>We aim to respond to complaints quickly (where possible, when you first tell us about the issue). This could mean an on-the-spot apology and explanation if something has clearly gone wrong, or immediate action to resolve the problem.</p>\n<p>We will give you our decision at stage 1 in five working days or less, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>If you are not satisfied with the response we give at this stage, we will tell you what you can do next. If you choose to, you can take your complaint to stage 2. You must normally ask us to consider your complaint at stage 2 either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>within six months of the event you want to complain about or finding out that you have a reason to complain; or</li>\n<li>within two months of receiving your stage 1 response (if this is later).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may be able to accept a stage 2 complaint after the time limit. If you feel that the time limit should not apply to your complaint, please tell us why.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Stage two – investigation</span></p>\n<p>Stage 2 deals with two types of complaint: those where the complainant remains dissatisfied after stage 1 and those that clearly require investigation, and so are handled directly at this stage. If you do not wish your complaint to be handled at stage 1, you can ask us to handle it at stage 2 instead.</p>\n<p>When using stage 2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within three working days</li>\n<li>we will confirm our understanding of the complaint we will investigate and what outcome you are looking for</li>\n<li>we will try to resolve your complaint where we can (in some cases we may suggest using an alternative complaint resolution approach, such as mediation); and</li>\n<li>where we cannot resolve your complaint, we will give you a full response as soon as possible, normally within 20 working days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If our investigation will take longer than 20 working days, we will tell you.
