      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Alicia wins the top cash prize of £500, for her innovative idea for a new swimming product which will simultaneously help young children learn to swim whilst also reducing equipment costs for providers.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Alicia is a first-year BSc (Hons) Physical Activity, Health and Wellbeing student at QMU, but also works part-time as a swimming teacher and is a mother of three children, aged 6, 3, and 1.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">LoveYourIdea is a national competition for students and recent graduates in Scotland to submit an innovative idea for a new sports product, service or technology. Operated by Stirling-based Sporting Chance Initiative and Stirling University Innovation Park, LoveYourIdea was launched in October 2015 and received over 300 entries from students across the country.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">With five cash prizes, the competition encouraged students from all backgrounds to think differently about sport and come up with exciting, innovative ideas.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">LoveYourIdea was the brainchild of Ryan Carenduff, Programme Manager of the Stirling-based Sports Innovation Challenge:</p>
<p>“I was inspired to create LoveYourIdea as a way to tap into the large number of students who have innovative ideas, but may not have considered starting their own sports business.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The competition had fantastic interest and buy-in for our pilot year of LoveYourIdea with over 300 submissions from all over Scottish universities and institutions which demonstrates the thriving community of entrepreneurial students.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">I am delighted to be able to announce Alicia as our LoveYourIdea winner; she has a fantastic user-led idea which could solve a real problem in the sports industry. I am also delighted that taking part has inspired Alicia to continue developing her idea with our Sports Innovation Challenge programme which has a £12,000 prize fund and wish her all the best going forward with it.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Kim Gilchrist, Head of Research &amp; Knowledge Exchange Development at Queen Margaret University said: ”Alicia is exceptional in terms of her entrepreneurial outlook and vision.  She is a credit to Queen Margaret University and an inspiration to other female entrepreneurs. She is a truly worthy winner of the LoveYourIdea top prize.”</p>]]></Value>
