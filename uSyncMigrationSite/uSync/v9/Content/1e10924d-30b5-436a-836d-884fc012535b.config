      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 1 – Application reviewed  </strong></span></p>
<p>All postgraduate applications received by the University are processed by the Admissions Office. Having submitted your application you should have received an official acknowledgement email which confirmed receipt of your application and advised you to submit the following supporting materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>An academic transcript</li>
<li>A copy of your final degree certificate (if available)</li>
<li>Two references</li>
<li>Confirmation of English language ability (if your first language is not English)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not included these items with your application please arrange for the above documents to be emailed to <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> as soon as possible. If any of these materials are not immediately available then please send in what information you have and forward the rest as it becomes available.</p>
<p>We aim to transmit a decision to you within 3-4 weeks of your supporting documents being received, however, at peak times this may be longer. Please note that where courses have applications deadlines, we often consider applications collectively after the deadline has passed.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Receiving a decision</strong></span></p>
<p>Once your application has been considered an email informing you of the decision shall be sent to you. If you are not successful and would like any guidance or feedback you are welcome to contact us via <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a>. </p>
<p>Please note that if you are offered a place on the course your notification email will include an electronic copy of your offer letter. A hard copy will not be posted to you.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>What does your offer mean?</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are made an offer of a place on the course this offer shall be either Conditional or Unconditional.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Conditional Offer</strong></span></p>
<p>If your offer is <strong>conditional</strong> this means that your place on the course is subject to you meeting specific conditions, such as receipt of satisfactory references or successful completion of your current degree. In order to take up your place you must fulfil the conditions that have been set in your offer. Your offer will be changed to unconditional once all these conditions have been met.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Unconditional Offer</strong></span></p>
<p>If you receive an <strong>unconditional</strong> offer then you have satisfied all the requirements for entry to your chosen course and do not need to send any further documents.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Waiting List</strong></span></p>
<p>Due to the level of demand on some of our postgraduate courses we often have to operate a waiting list. If you are offered a place on a waiting list then the Admissions Tutor has deemed you eligible for entry, however, due to the limited number of places available we have been unable to offer you a place at this time. If you accept a place on the waiting list then we shall contact you if a place subsequently becomes available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 2 - Responding to your offer</strong></span></p>
<p>Whether we have made you a conditional, unconditional or waiting list offer, we would now ask that you respond to your offer within 21 days in one of the following ways:</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Accepting</strong></span></p>
<p>If you would like to accept your offer, please email <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> as soon as possible. In accepting your offer, you are agreeing to our Terms and Conditions . Please ensure that you read these before accepting your offer.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Declining</strong></span></p>
<p>We are sorry that you have decided not to take up your place at Queen Margaret University. Please inform us of your decision by emailing <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> so that your place can be reallocated to another applicant.</p>
<p>We wish you all the best with your alternative plans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Deferring</strong></span></p>
<p>If you would like to defer your offer to the following academic year, please email <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a>. We shall inform you of the Admissions Tutors’ decision as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is not always possible to defer your offer of study and in this instance you are welcome to reapply the following academic year.</p>
<p>Please note that if your deferral is permitted then you can only defer your offer of a place once and after this time will be asked to reapply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Visiting the University</strong></p>
<p>If you have received an offer of a place on a postgraduate course you may find it useful to come along to one of our Postgraduate Open Evenings. This is an excellent opportunity for you to</p>
<p>have a one-to-one discussion with subject area academic staff who can talk to you about your chosen programme of study</p>
<p>take a campus tour and see our modern facilities for yourself including our Learning Resource Centre<br />speak to the Student Funding Adviser about funding options</p>
<p>Dates for Open Days and Open Evenings can be found on <a href="http://www.qmu.ac.uk/marketing/bulletins/opendays.htm">http://www.qmu.ac.uk/marketing/bulletins/opendays.htm</a> </p>
<p>If you are unable to attend one of our Postgraduate Open Evenings and would like to visit the University then please contact our Recruitment Team on <a href="mailto:RILO@qmu.ac.uk">RILO@qmu.ac.uk</a> and they shall arrange a suitable time with you to visit the University to receive an individual tour of the facilities from one of our Student Ambassadors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 4 – Prior to Entry</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>If your offer is Conditional -</strong></span></p>
<p>In order to take up your place you must fulfil the conditions that have been set in your offer. Once you have met these conditions you must send evidence. Your offer letter will state what your conditions are and what you need to send.</p>
<p>Proof that you have met the conditions of your offer should be sent directly to the Admissions Office. Once all the conditions have been met your offer will then become unconditional.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Disclosure/Police Check</strong></span></p>
<p>If you decide to accept our offer to study one of our Healthcare courses, you are required to provide us with a satisfactory criminal record check. Please note that Queen Margaret University reserves the right to withdraw your offer if your criminal record is not acceptable. If you have any questions about this, please contact <a href="mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> </p>
<p>Further information about <a href="/{localLink:umb://media/efbcfe545b6746de8e14ec4c4485c9b5}" title="Disclosure Level And Pvg Scheme Guidance">how to apply for this criminal record check</a> can be found by clicking on the link.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Financial Support</strong></span></p>
<p>We would advise you to start considering your funding options as soon as you have received your offer. You will find funding information by selecting the “funding” link on the left hand side of this page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Accommodation</strong></span></p>
<p>If you wish to apply for Queen Margaret University accommodation then you can do so online , whether you are holding a conditional or unconditional offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Timetable</strong></span></p>
<p>The Admissions Office does not issue timetables. If you would like to view a provisional academic<a href="http://www.qmu.ac.uk/portal/timetables.htm"> timetable</a> then this is normally available from June onwards.</p>
<p>Official timetables are not available until the beginning of each semester. If you are required to select modules on entry then this will be part of the matriculation process which you shall complete in September. A completed timetable will then be available for you to view within your student portal once you have registered as a student.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>International Applicants</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are a non-EU/EEA national and require a visa to gain entry to the UK then you must pay a minimum tuition fee deposit of £5000 or provide proof that you are being sponsored by an approved agency in order to be issued with a Confirmation of Acceptance of Study (CAS). Your CAS Number is a unique number generated by Queen Margaret University through the UKBA and will be emailed to you in a CAS Statement.</p>
<p>International students who require a <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/c0cc3c0289c748ca8a2ac28c37263d78}" title="Visas and Immigration">student visa</a> can find further information on how to arrange this by clicking on the link.</p>
<p>A CAS will only be provided to applicants who have accepted an unconditional offer from QMU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Step 5 – Joining Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Joining Information</strong></span></p>
<p>Joining Information shall be sent to those who have accepted an unconditional offer in the summer to those who hold and have accepted an offer.</p>
