      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Your feedback helps us improve your student experience, including the quality of our academic programmes and services.</p>
<p>It’s important that you let us know as soon as possible about any issues, as well as telling us what we do well.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can communicate with us – some informal and others more formal. We run a number of surveys during the year, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The QMU Entrants Survey (QES) for students who have just joined QMU;</li>
<li>The National Student Survey (NSS) for final year undergraduates;</li>
<li>Our own QMU Student Survey (QSS) for all other taught students.</li>
</ul>
<p>These give students at every level of study the opportunity to comment. Taking part won’t take up much of your time and you’ll even get the chance to win a prize! Find out more about these surveys by clicking on the relevant tabs below.</p>
<p>Check what your feedback can do under Making a Difference, where you can see some of the changes that we’ve made.</p>
<p>Class Reps also play a key role in representing students’ views on their teaching and learning experience. Make sure you know who your Rep is, or why not consider becoming a Rep yourself? Go to Student Representation for more information.</p>]]></Value>
