You will study the same core modules as full-time Business Management students, covering core management areas such as marketing, business law, research methods and strategy. There will be work-based learning modules throughout your degree, allowing you to complete projects designed to support your employer’s business goals and objectives. You will benefit from guidance, mentoring and one-to-one supervision provided by our academic staff in support with your employer mentor.</p>\n<p>Each year of the GA programme is structured around two 11-week semesters. You will attend lectures, seminars and workshops on campus one day a week during term time. Outside of this formal campus time you will continue to develop your expertise in your workplace and through independent study of around six hours per week.</p>\n<p>Your fellow GAs will likely come from very different organisations and have a range of experience. This provides a stimulating and rewarding stage in your professional and personal development, and a unique networking opportunity.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Rewarding for employers</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXJ_IaGYElY\" title=\"Graduate Apprenticeships (YouTube video)\" data-anchor=\"?v=lXJ_IaGYElY\">Our Graduate Apprenticeships scheme video</a> has more background information on the scheme including the great benefits for employers as well as students.</p>"
