Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>QMU is committed to generating new ideas, supporting their development and translation, and making them widely available for adoption by practitioners to provide solutions addressing real world problems. Our ambition is that QMU research and knowledge is translated by the people and organisations most able to influence policy and inform practice, to make a positive difference to everyday life.</p>
<p>Whilst in UK law the University owns legal title over intellectual property (IP) produced by its staff in their work, QMU recognises that staff and their collaborators may be best placed to develop their research into new products and applications which offer solutions to prospective end-users. Intellectual Property is valuable to the University and individual researchers, in their designated University role, and it may have commercial value. QMU believes that researchers should have free, uninhibited access to the IP they have generated during their research except in specific circumstances which might disadvantage the University – these are set out below in Section 2. The University aims to support both staff and the University’s use of University-generated IP and promote access for other parties use of that IP to help develop practical, user-centric, beneficial applications.</p>
<p>“Intellectual property” covers all IP, including but not limited to all inventions, designs, information, specifications, formulae, improvements, discoveries, know-how, data, processes, methods, techniques and the IP rights therein, including but not limited to patents, copyrights, database rights, design rights (registered and unregistered), trademarks, trade names and service marks and the right to apply for any of the above as recognised in any country in the world. For the avoidance of doubt, IP shall not include any personal data (as defined in the General Data Protection Regulations 2018) of which the University is the data controller (“Personal data”). The University will retain ownership of all Personal data and this Policy is not intended to authorise any other party to process such Personal Data without the consent and authorisation of the University.</p>]]></Value>

    "name": "2. Intellectual Property Ownership",
    "ncContentTypeAlias": "centralBlocks",
    "title": "2. Intellectual Property Ownership",
    "content": "<p>The general rule in relation to IP created by an employee during the course of their employment is that, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, the first owner is the employer. This position arises due to statutes governing intellectual property. In the case of inventive products and processes, the Patents Act 1977 confers first ownership of an invention created by an employee to the employer. In relation to copyright works and registered and unregistered design rights (copyright works being literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works), the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, the Registered Designs Act 1949 and the Regulation on Community Designs (6/2002/EC) all operate to confer ownership of copyright works and UK and EU designs created by an employee to the employer. Similarly, the first owner of database rights in a database will be the employer pursuant to the Copyright, Rights in Databases Regulations 1997.</p>\n<p>Whilst the de facto legal position is that the University owns the IP arising from work undertaken by its employees, this University Intellectual Property Policy modifies the position of IP ownership at QMU for staff and students as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Staff</strong></p>\n<p>All IP generated by staff during the course of their employment by the University and/or using University resources (“Staff IP”) will be owned by the inventor (the member of staff who creates the IP), except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where, as a condition of support an external funder providing funding or other support requires that Staff IP is assigned to that external sponsor; or</li>\n<li>Where the Staff IP has been developed in the production of a course or teaching materials, in which cases the Staff IP will be owned by the University; or</li>\n<li>Where the Staff IP has been developed during and within the scope of Contract, Commissioned or Collaborative Research and the relationship requires that the Staff IP is assigned to one or more third parties.</li>\n<li>Exceptionally, and only at the point at which potential IP is disclosed (see Section 5), the University identifies that the commercial opportunity would be best realised by a traditional model of IP exploitation led by the University. In such cases, after the University has recovered the direct costs incurred by it for any registration of IP rights and all external costs incurred for exploitation, remaining revenues will be shared equally between the University and the inventors (50% each).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event where any of the exceptions above are considered by the University to apply, the staff member shall execute and deliver such documents and perform such acts as may reasonably be required in order to ensure that ownership of Staff IP is assigned to the correct party, as set out above. In certain cases, the University may require the staff member to sign an agreement formally assigning IP to the University.</p>\n<p><strong>Students</strong></p>\n<p>All IP generated by students during the course of their studies at the University and/or using University resources (“Student IP”) will be owned by the inventor (the student who created the IP), except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where, as a condition of support an external funder providing funding or other support requires that Student IP is assigned to them (for example projects involving 3rd parties and work requiring use of pre-existing University-owned IP); or</li>\n<li>Where the Student IP has been developed in the production of an MSc or PhD thesis or in the production of course or teaching materials, in which cases the Student IP will be owned by the University.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event where any of the exceptions above are considered by the University to apply, the student shall execute and deliver such documents and perform such acts as may reasonably be required in order to ensure that ownership of Student IP is vested in the correct party, as set out above, and the University may require the student to do so at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Joint ownership</strong></p>\n<p>Where multiple inventors are responsible for the creation of IP using the University’s resources, and at least one inventor is a University staff member or student, the IP shall be owned jointly by the inventors (“Joint IP”), unless the IP falls into one of the exceptions relating to Staff or Student IP in section 2(a) or 2(b) above. Joint ownership requires more ongoing management and should only apply where the contributions of each inventor are not distinct and cannot be separated. Joint inventors are best placed to agree between themselves how Joint IP should be protected and how any revenue generated be shared, and the University would not normally expect to be involved in any negotiations between the inventors on the issues surrounding Joint IP.</p>"
