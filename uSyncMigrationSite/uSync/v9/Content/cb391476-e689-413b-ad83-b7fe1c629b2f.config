      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This Handbook provides an overview of partnership and placement arrangements for the QMU ITE programmes and the processes and support mechanisms involved in placement provision. The Handbook is intended for ITE students, host schools and the supporting teachers (SBEs) and University-Based Educators (UBEs). Programme and Placement information in the handbook includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Partnership between schools and university</li>
<li>An overview of ITE programmes &amp; placements</li>
<li>Organisation of School Experience processes &amp; procedures</li>
<li>Preparing students for School Experience</li>
<li>Assessment processes and paperwork</li>
<li>Contact and support mechanisms</li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities during School Experience</li>
</ul>
<p>School Experience is a compulsory part of the ITE learning process.<span>  It allows students the opportunity to gain experience of practice-based teaching and learning within a classroom setting.  Both the host School and the University have a joint responsibility in ensuring that students are given appropriate opportunities to gain the required knowledge and understanding, skills and abilities expected of a student teacher for the appropriate stage of their professional development within the school context and their ITE University Programme</span></p>
<p><span>School Experience enables the acquisition of new knowledge and skills as well as the application, consolidation and reflection on learning gained within the University environment. School and University-based Educators, working in collaboration, therefore have a crucial part to play in supporting students’ progress to meet the General Teaching Council, Scotland (GTCS) Standard for Provisional Registration (SPR). The success of School Experience is highly dependent on a clear and supportive interchange between ITE students, university, the local authority and schools.  All Placement forms are in Appendices for Information Only.</span></p>

They will facilitate the student’s learning in the classroom context.  </p>\n<p>The <strong>GTCS Standard for Provisional Registration (SPR) </strong>and the <strong>Student Teacher Code</strong> provide direction for programme-related practice experience. Working together with, and being guided by, the School Based-Educator, it is expected that students will take account of these outcomes and will consider ways in which they can meet the requirements of the SPR.  By the end of the first School Placement, 6 out of 8 of the SPR Criteria on the Final Report Form should be achieved, but all eight criteria must be achieved by the end of the Second School Placement. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"lead\">The Standards for Registration: Mandatory Requirement for Registration with General Teaching Council for Scotland</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“The Standard for Provisional Registration is the benchmark of competence required of all student teachers at the end of Initial Teacher Education who are seeking provisional registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTC Scotland).

    "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\">The Student Placement System(SPS)</span></p>\n<p>Placements are organised as part of a national on-line system known as the Student Placement System (SPS), which is based on matching requests from universities to offers of placements from individual schools via their Local Authority. The system is managed by the GTCS. </p>\n<p>The SPS operates to a strict, nationally agreed timeline and meeting the required deadlines is essential. Once schools have submitted their offers in line with the SPS timeline, Local Authorities will confirm offers. Universities are required to upload course details and student data for placements due to take place within the forthcoming academic year. The system will then run rounds of automated matching and both Universities and Local Authorities will also have the facility to manually match students to schools. Once matches are approved by Universities and Local Authorities schools will be notified via email of the students they should expect to receive throughout the school year. Normally, </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Round one will match placements which start before November</li>\n<li>Round two will match placements which start before February</li>\n<li>Round three will match placements which start after May</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, should COVID-19 circumstances arise, the system may adjust these timescales. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Allocation of School Placements</span></p>\n<p>Students will complete a placement application form and the information they provide will be uploaded to the SPS. Under no circumstances should students attempt to organise their own placement directly with a school. Students who attempt this will be referred to the University’s Professional Progress Committee (PPC). </p>\n<p><em>Please also note that students can be placed in any one of the 32 local authorities. </em> </p>\n<p>While we try to bear in mind any preference a student might have, there are other considerations, which may well take precedence when placing students. In particular, the centralised procedures for placing students, the induction programmes for newly qualified teachers and the recent increases in the numbers of student teachers across Scotland have placed pressure on school capacity. <strong><u>Students</u> <u>may be required to travel to a placement in an outlying area</u></strong> and should be prepared to travel up to 90 minutes each way.Placements are allocated based on a student’s <strong>term time address and mode of transport. </strong>The Partnership and Placement Office will have the final decision on which school students will attend. Placement enquiries should be sent to <u><a href=\"mailto:ITEplacements@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Partnership and Placement Email Address\">ITEplacement Email Address</a> </u>using the student e-mail account. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Religious and/or Cultural Observances</span></p>\n<p>A student’s identity, such as their religious/ cultural practices can have a significant impact on teaching, learning and assessment in practice. However, it is a statutory requirement that the  University and placement providers address these through establishing relevant policies and guidance which address diversity and inclusion. </p>\n<p>These policies include a commitment to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoting equal opportunity and diversity during employment</li>\n<li>Ensuring all employees are treated fairly and valued equally</li>\n<li>Valuing religious and cultural needs and practices and meeting these where possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  Students may have religious or cultural needs in terms of requests which may appear to “conflict” with existing working requirements in the practice setting. Such issues may include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health and safety issues relating to dress code</li>\n<li>Request for flexible working related to religious/belief-related festivals</li>\n<li>Adjustments for prayer time, and space. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whilst it may not always be possible to accommodate every student’s religious or cultural observance, every effort will be made to find a mutually agreeable solution<strong>.  </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong><span class=\"lead\">Our guiding principles: </span></p>\n<p>Normally, students will be allocated placements according to their term time address and can expect to travel up to 90 minutes to and from a placement, unless there is some exceptional reason, which would impact adversely on the student or placement. In these exceptional circumstances, negotiation between the student, the university, and school is essential.</p>\n<p>Established policies that apply to employed staff also apply to students accepted on placement. It is vital that discussion takes place on the religious and cultural needs of the student and how they will be valued and/or met whilst on placement. Agreements between the student and placement provider may occur prior to, or at the outset of any placement as part of the induction process. These should be reviewed and discussed with the student at the midway point of the placement. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Catholic Teachers’ Certificate </span></p>\n<p>Students who are eligible and wish to obtain the Catholic Teachers’ Certificate must complete the online CREDL (Certificate in Religious Education through Distance Learning) programme. This Certificate is recognised by the Bishops of Scotland as a preliminary qualification in generalist Catholic religious education for those who wish to teach religious education in Catholic primary or secondary schools. For eligible PGDE students who wish to complete this programme, further information can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/religiouseducationbydistancelearning/\" title=\"Catholic Teachers’ Certificate\">Catholic Teachers’ Certificate</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Students with Disabilities</span> <strong> </strong></p>\n<p>QMU is committed to equality of opportunity and believes in a culture of diversity and inclusion<a name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"/study-here/student-services/disability-service/\" title=\"QMU Disability Service\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Disabled students should experience the same broad range of practice settings to enable them to demonstrate that they have achieved the learning outcomes for each placement. At QMU, the term ‘disabled’ relates to the impact of an illness, impairment, developmental disorder or specific learning difficulty on the specific tasks associated with university level study. The Disability Service works with a broad range of students including those with long term medical conditions (such as MS, epilepsy, diabetes, chronic fatigue etc), mental health difficulties, sensory impairments, physical impairments, those on the autism spectrum and those with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia). </p>\n<p>Disabled students are actively encouraged to meet with the Disability Adviser (DA) to discuss their  Individual Learning Plan (ILP). Disability Advisers email the ILP to the university’s Academic Disabled Students Coordinator (ADSC) as this is an opportunity for dialogue between them to check if there is a recommendation which may need to be amended. In some circumstances, though not often, the DA may ask the ADSC to share the ILP with relevant academics. The student can of course choose to share their ILP for any reasonable adjustments and assessment arrangements to be made, which may be necessary to enable them to meet the learning outcomes of each school experience.  QMU acknowledges that not all information about a student’s disability or health may be relevant to placement providers and that normally, information would be provided with student’s agreement.  Reasonable adjustments during school experience are dependent on students disclosing a disability or health condition, or at least, sharing information about their needs with the placement provider. </p>\n<p>Students should keep their Personal Academic Tutor, or Programme Leader, University and School- Based Educators, Disability Service and their ADSC informed of any changes to their health status. It is essential that students discuss any concerns they may have with staff as early as possible. </p>\n<p><strong><em>If students require further information or advice they should contact the Disability Service for a confidential chat. </em></strong> </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Changes to Placement School</span> <strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Placement allocations are non-negotiable. Students do not have the right to exchange allocated Placement with their peers. Normally, the Programme teams do not enter into third party communications about allocated Placements. The responsibility lies with the student to raise reasonable and relevant concerns directly with the Placement Officer for Partnerships and Placements. The following are <strong>not </strong>considered valid reasons to request a change in Placement:<span> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal preference - allocated placements are deemed relevant and will offer appropriate learning experiences.</li>\n<li>Financial hardship - students should consider the cost of school experience as being a necessary and integral part of the programme and plan for this in advance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students may only request a change in placement allocation for <u>extenuating circumstances</u> not identified on the school experience information form, e.g. changes to health or well-being requiring reasonable adjustments. Relevant supporting evidence must be provided to the Partnership and Placement Officer (e.g. medical certificate) before any such request can be considered. Evidence that is subsequently proven to be false is brought to the attention of the Academic Lead for Partnerships and Placements. Requesting a change of school placement allocation does not guarantee that it can be made. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Travel and Accommodation</span> </p>\n<p>There is no direct provision by QMU for the cost of accommodation or travel expenses whilst on placement. Students should consider the cost of school experience as being a necessary and integral element of the programme and plan for this in advance.<span>  </span></p>\n<p>The University Student Finance Service administers two discretionary funds provided by the Scottish Government. These are the Childcare Fund which is aimed at students who incur childcare costs whilst studying and the Hardship Fund when students find themselves facing exceptional financial problems. An application form is completed and submitted with supporting evidence which is then considered at a confidential monthly meeting of the Hardship Committee. It is useful to make an appointment to see the Student Finance Adviser before submitting an application. Student Finance Adviser: <a href=\"mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk.\" title=\"QMU Student Funding\">Student Funding at QMU</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Attendance</span> <strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Students are expected to arrive at their placement school well before the start of the school day to ensure lessons are well prepared and resourced before pupils arrive. They should also expect to stay on after the end of the school day to tidy up, mark pupils’ work, put up displays, attend any staff or planning meetings, plan and prepare lessons or activities for the next day or help with after school clubs. As a guide, student teachers are expected to arrive at school between 8.00-8.30am and leave 4.30-5pm. </p>\n<p>If difficulties arise with placement hours, School-Based Educator/Mentors, and the student are actively encouraged to draw this to the attention of the school and university so that a mutually acceptable plan of action can be developed. </p>\n<p>The University is aware that many students now find it essential to find work whilst studying. However, employment outside of the programme must not adversely affect student’s work during school experience. Students are expected to mirror their working patterns to those in operation at the school. They must recognise that flexibility on the part of the school is <u>not</u> to be expected. </p>\n<p>Similarly, all requests for pre-arranged absence from placement must be discussed with the University. Planned absences from school experience placement may be approved by the University in exceptional circumstances only. </p>\n<p>  <strong>IMPORTANT: Students do not have the right to negotiate holidays, or other leaves of absence during a placement directly with the University Based Educator (University Lecturer) or School Based Educator (School Mentor).</strong>  </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Absence from Placement </span></p>\n<p>Students are expected to comply with the attendance and reporting sickness policies of the school and must familiarize themselves with these policies within the first week of placement. If absence is before the start of a placement the student must contact the School’s Curriculum Leader or the Mentor to report any sickness or absence. </p>\n<p>Every student is required to inform the school <u>and</u> the University’s Placement Officer should they be unable to attend their placement on any given day. As a courtesy they should also inform their UBE and Programme Leader. Students should: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact both placement school and the Partnership and Placement Officer</li>\n<li>Complete a self-certificate via the Hub</li>\n<li>If absent for more than one day students should contact both the placement school and the Partnership and Placement Officer on each day of absence</li>\n<li>If absent for more than 5 working days students must submit a medical certificate to <u><a href=\"mailto:ITEplacements@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Partnership and Placement Email Address\">ITEplacement Email Address</a></u> </li>\n<li>When students return to school they should advise the Partnership and Placement Officer, via<u> <a href=\"mailto:ITEplacements@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Partnership and Placement Email Address\"> ITEplacement Email Address</a></u> </li>\n<li>Any days missed due to absence must be made up at the end of the placement if the school is in agreement or by undertaking an additional placement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT: Failure by students to inform the University Based Educator, and the University that they are not attending placement will be regarded as unprofessional behaviour.</em></strong></p>\n<p>In the event that students have an authorised or unexpected absence from Placement which lasts for more than 24 hours we ask that the School-Based Educator informs the University’s Partnership and Placement Officer - <u><a href=\"mailto:ITEplacements@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Partnership and Placement Email Address\">ITEplacement Email Address</a></u> </p>\n<p>Attendance must be monitored throughout the placement and all absences from placement must be recorded by School-Based Educator (School Mentor). </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Covid-19 Absence </span></p>\n<p>If a student teacher cannot attend the placement school because of the imposition of lockdown or a requirement to self-isolate, then they would be asked to support the work of the school by engaging online to support learning and timetabled classes. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Fitness to Practise, Health-related and/or Personal Issues </span></p>\n<p>At QMU we must ensure that all students maintain proper teaching standards whilst on placement. This is about safeguarding that our students are fit to practice, so that public trust and confidence in teachers is maintained and the learning of our children and young people is protected. </p>\n<p>  If the University becomes aware of an issue regarding a student’s health or behaviour which may have an adverse effect on the student and or school experience, a Fitness to Practise (FtP) Panel may be convened by the University. The Fitness to Practise (FtP) Panel has the delegated authority to impose a range of sanctions including requiring a student to suspend study or withdraw from the programme. If the outcomes of the FtP Panel prevent a student from starting or continuing with a school placement these will be discussed at the next Professional Programme Committee (PPC) and a recommendation made regarding their progress on the professional programme. See QMU’s Fitness to practice policy: [ broken link]</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Prior to School Experience: Guiding Principles Covid-19</span> </p>\n<p>In response to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and in consultation with our LA Partners, Head teachers and based on guidance from ADES, GTCS, SCDES the following changes to our usual procedures were implemented in 2020/21.  Should guidance from the Scottish Government advise of further restrictions these actions may be further amended.  During Semester 2021/22:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Students undertake a risk assessment exercise prior to or at the start of placement using the school’s or LA’s risk assessment procedures.</li>\n<li>The student will complete (with a member of school staff) a signed checklist to the University to inform the University that they have complied with all school regulations.</li>\n<li>School-based Educators/Mentors should arrange for a period of observation to allow students to become familiar with school procedures and hygiene protocols.</li>\n<li>Student teachers should not be expected to teach unsupported from day one of the placement</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Student teachers will be expected to follow all of the same procedures that school staff are already following. During the University-based elements of their programme, student teachers have been informed that, at all times, they need to follow all the public health advice and procedures that have been issued by The Scottish Government, (https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-COVID-19/); Student teachers have also been advised to continue to use the NHS Scotland’s free Protect Scotland app. </p>\n<p><strong>Guiding Principles non-Covid-19 Specific: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any student experiencing ill health and/or personal issues prior to a Placement should make an appointment to meet with either the Personal Academic Tutor (PAT), and/or their University Tutor (UBE). </li>\n<li>A course of action will be agreed in order that appropriate measures and/or reasonable adjustments are in place for the duration of the placement. This may involve the Programme Leader, Disability Advisor, Student Councillor and the school as required.</li>\n<li>Following a discussion with the student, the Programme Leader may recommend that the student consults a medical practitioner in order to obtain a medical assessment on whether the student is able to commence the Placement. A supporting medical certificate must be obtained by the student and forwarded to the Programme Leader and Placement Officer.</li>\n<li>If the student is unable to commence a Placement, it will be deferred, and the student will undertake another Placement once she/he is in sound health subject to confirmation of fitness to practise by a medical practitioner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">During School Experience: Guiding Principles Covid-19</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students developing a health issue during school experience that significantly impacts on their performance, safety of self or others are advised to discuss their situation with the School Mentor, and their University Tutor <u>immediately</u>. If students suspect they are developing  signs that may be Covid-19 related they should follow the latest prescribed public health advice and procedures issued by The Scottish Government, call NHS Inform on 0800 028 2816, or use the NHS Web Chat tool.   Further guidance can be found on the QMU Web-page <a href=\"/coronavirus/\" title=\"QMU covid-19 Webpage\">QMU Covid-19 Advice</a> or <a href=\"mailto:CovidHelp@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Covid-19 Email Address\">QMU covid Email Address</a> </li>\n<li>In other health circumstances, following discussions with all relevant parties the student may be advised to consult a medical practitioner to obtain a supporting medical certificate providing confirmation of their current health status and forward this to the University.</li>\n<li>Any of the above circumstances could lead to the placement being terminated with the student commencing another placement when she/he is sound health subject to confirmation of fitness to practice by a medical practitioner.</li>\n<li>In such instances, the University-Based Educator invites the student to a <strong>Pre-Professional </strong><strong>Progress Committee (PPC) </strong>meeting recording the discussion on the appropriate form (Appendix Four). A copy of this will be noted at the Professional Progress Committee and will be held in their file. <strong>See section below for details of PPC.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Student Withdrawal/ Removal from School Placement</span> </p>\n<p>If a student chooses to withdraw from a Placement without prior discussion with the School-Based Educator (School mentor), and without the approval of the University, normally, the student is deemed to have failed the Placement Module. However, if extenuating circumstances occur which preclude prior discussion (such as serious illness, or a sudden family bereavement) then a course of action will be mutually agreed. </p>\n<p>  There may be rare occasions when the school feels it appropriate to remove a student from the placement area immediately, and they have the authority to do so. While, on these rare occasions, the placement school will report the matter at its earliest convenience to the University, the student is also required to inform the PGDE Programme Leader, UBE and Personal Academic Tutor immediately if any such event occurs. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Complaints Handling Procedure</span> </p>\n<p>The University has implemented a Complaints Handling Procedure (QMU 2014a) which can be found <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/complaints-procedure/\" title=\"QMU Complaints Procedure\">Complaints Handling Procedure Web Page</a> </p>"

See PGDE Programme handbook for details.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Protection of Vulnerable Groups Scheme (PVG)</span> </p>\n<p>As students will be doing regulated work with pupils, and protected adults during school experience, they must apply to register with the Protection of Vulnerable Groups Scheme (PVG). It is the responsibility of each student to fill in the detailed application form provide the necessary documentation and to pay for this to be carried out prior to the first school experience. The University ensures that all PVG membership applications are appropriately checked and countersigned and that the whole process has been completed satisfactorily prior to the commencement of placement. Some placements providers require additional checks before accepting students on placements and make this known to the University when making placement offers.</p>\n<p>Further information on the PVG Scheme is available at: <a href=\"https://www.mygov.scot/pvg-scheme?via=https://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/disclosureinformation/pvgscheme.htm\" title=\"Disclosure Scotland Website\" data-anchor=\"?via=https://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/disclosureinformation/pvgscheme.htm\">Disclosure Scotland Website</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT: Failure to have PVG Certificate in place will result in the deferral of a school placement.</em></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Insurance Cover for Motor Vehicle Use</span></p>\n<p>Students using their own motor vehicle during school experience will be expected to obtain confirmation from their insurers that adequate cost cover is in place for all costs and claims and no liability is placed on the University and/or placement provider. <strong>This is usually business cover</strong>. The vehicle must be in a roadworthy condition with valid road tax and MOT (if applicable). A copy of the insurance policy certificate must be retained for inspection. Under no circumstance should students carry pupils, parents, teachers, or others employed by the school in their own vehicle. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Dress Code </span></p>\n<p>Dress code on placement ought to be smart casual. If in doubt students should ask their University or School-Based Educator. As a guide: </p>\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 50%;\">\n<p><strong>Smart Casual Do’s </strong> </p>\n</th>\n<th style=\"width: 50%;\">\n<p><strong>Smart Casual Please Avoid: </strong> </p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n<ul>\n<li>jacket or blazer cardigan or jumper</li>\n<li>trousers</li>\n<li>long sleeved shirt (tie is optional),</li>\n<li>blouse</li>\n<li>closed shoes,</li>\n<li>flat shoes,</li>\n<li>pumps  </li>\n<li>mid-length dress or skirt      </li>\n<li>jewellery and accessories  </li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n<ul>\n<li>jeans <span> </span></li>\n<li>denim jacket <span> </span>shorts <span> </span></li>\n<li>flip flops</li>\n<li>sandals</li>\n<li>high stilettos  </li>\n<li>t-shirts</li>\n<li>caps</li>\n<li>sports wear  </li>\n<li>logos and slogans on tops  </li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A student whose personal appearance is deemed to be inappropriate by the School-Based Educator, Regent or Head teacher may be asked to leave the educational setting and reported absent until they return dressed appropriately. Placement hours may be deducted for this absence. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Confidentiality Issues </span></p>\n<p>Ensuring confidentiality is not just good practice; it is a right owed to all individuals and is central to the maintenance of trust between schools, teaching staff, parents and pupils. They have the legitimate expectation that students will respect their privacy and act appropriately. Students are expected to adhere to and comply with guidance provided by the regulatory body GTCS  which includes the <a href=\"https://www.gtcs.org.uk/student-teachers/student-teacher-code/\" title=\"Student Teacher Code Website\">Student Teacher Code Website</a> and  <a href=\"https://www.gtcs.org.uk/fitness-to-teach/code-of-professionalism-and-conduct/\" title=\"GTCS COPAC Policy\">GTCS COPAC Policy</a></p>\n<p>Any written work completed by students during placement must also be stored as a confidential record. At all times, the identity of anyone connected with the school experience Placement must be protected, and permission for the use of sensitive material must follow the policies and guidelines of the Placement school. </p>\n<p>It is important that students do not specifically name staff, or work placement areas on any documents, or in assignments submitted to the University. Students are advised to describe placements in general terms for example, “planning team”, “additional support service”. Pupils may be referred to by initials. </p>\n<p>School-Based Educators play an important role in the assessment process and should demonstrate professional and caring attitudes when assessing a student teacher’s lesson plans or performance. It is important to recognise that students are in a learning situation. Formative feedback should enable the student to feel secure in being able to reflect on any mistakes, errors or misjudgments and be seen as essential towards supporting a student’s professional development. School-Based Educators, however, should report any serious health and safety breaches or security or confidentiality issues to the University as a matter of priority.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Assessment of School Experience</span><span>  </span></p>\n<p>School Experience is assessed at regular intervals through: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly Evaluation (Weekly Reviews)</li>\n<li>Ongoing informal observation and feedback (class teachers)</li>\n<li>Formal Formative Observation by SBE  </li>\n<li>Mid-way Review (UBE and Student)</li>\n<li>Joint Formative Observation (University and School staff)  </li>\n<li>Summative Placement Report (School staff in consultation with University</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Weekly Evaluation Reviews  </span></p>\n<p>The weekly evaluation review is a tool for regular dialogue between the Student and Mentor to keep the student focused on self-evaluation and achievement of the SPR. SPR targets should be agreed and reviewed on a weekly basis. Once completed by the student and agreed by the SBE the Review form is uploaded to the Pebblepad Portfolio via the Pebblepocket App.  See Appendix 1.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Informal Observations and Feedback</span></p>\n<p>Formative assessment of learning during the Placement should be regular and ongoing in a way that develops the student’s self-confidence.   This may be undertaken by class teachers.  Supportive feedback should also be provided on lesson planning, or by direct observation of teaching followed by discussion.  It is useful for the student to be supported in identifying next steps for professional learning and where possible this be provided in writing in the form of next steps by the observing teacher.  A form for use by teachers is attached at Appendix 2.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Formal Formative Observations </span> </p>\n<p>Formal Formative observations should use the Pre-Midway Review Formative lesson observation form (Appendix Three) and follow the guidance provided. This should be undertaken by the lead SBE (student mentor) to inform progress at the Mid-Way Review stage.   Following the lesson, the observer should share supportive feedback on the lesson with the student and share a copy of the observation form for the student to add to their Pebble-pad PDP. </p>\n<p>There will also be <strong>one visit</strong> by a University-based Educator to undertake a <strong>shared observation</strong> of the student’s classroom practice, within the last 3 weeks of the placement following the Mid-Way Review.  The University staff member will complete this Formative Report and the grades awarded will be agreed between the University and the School.  In accord with National GTCS and SCDE Guidance of April 2021 the following factors will inform the Assessment process during an observation visit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>observation of a lesson;</li>\n<li>scrutiny of the school experience file;</li>\n<li>professional dialogue with the in-school supporter and;</li>\n<li>professional learning conversation with the student teacher</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Together these will form a holistic assessment of the student’s progress and grades of either Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory progress will be awarded in accord with the appropriate stage in their ITE Programme.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Mid-way Review </span></p>\n<p>The Mid-Way Review is a formalised formative Review taking place halfway through each placement. The SBE should undertake a formal formative observation of teaching prior to the Midway Review discussion.  This should highlight key areas of strength and further development areas across the SPR. These should be agreed between the student and the SBE and addressed in the second half of the placement.   The student is responsible for completing the form and once it is signed by both parties the student will upload the Form to the University Dropbox. See Appendix 4</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">End of Placement Report</span> </p>\n<p>The final Placement report form (Appendix Six) should be completed by the School-Based Educator (School mentor) at least one day before the end of the school experience. Final grades must be agreed between the School-Based Educator (School mentor) and University based Educator before the Report is shared with, and signed by, the student.  It should be in line with the Report from the Joint Observation lesson.  In making a judgement, it is important to bear in mind the extent to which the Placement has allowed the opportunity for the student to demonstrate the criterion being considered, and what can be realistically expected from students in relation to their stage of the programme.  There is Guidance for completing the report available at Appendix 7.</p>\n<p>On the rare occasion where a particular criterion is not applicable to the practice setting, or where the student has not been assessed on a particular criterion, then N/A should be recorded. This might be as a result of Covid restrictions, for example.  The School-based Educator should document the reason(s) for lack of opportunity in the comments section.  </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Progression </span></p>\n<p>In <strong>Placement 1b students need to achieve 6 out of 8 satisfactory SPR grades</strong>.  By the end of <strong>Placement 2, they must achieve 8 out of 8 satisfactory grades</strong>.  </p>\n<p>If a student’s progress is not satisfactory it should be noted and discussed in the Weekly Evaluation. If the student does not make Satisfactory progress with SPR targets, then this should be recorded in the Mid-way review and an action plan drawn up and sent to the University Based Educator. If the issues require more immediate action, or are not resolved following the Mid-way Review, then a <strong>Cause for Concern</strong> form needs to be completed and forwarded to the University.  The University Based-Educator will support the student in drawing up an Action Plan to help them overcome their targets. The final stage of this process if targets are not met, is a referral to the Professional Progress Committee.  </p>\n<p>If a student does not achieve the required number of satisfactory grades this could lead to a retrieval placement in late August/early September, as agreed by the Board of Examiners. In this case to be eligible to graduate and progress into practice it would first be necessary to successfully complete any retrieval placement(s). </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Professional Progress</span></p>\n<p>If a student’s progress is deemed unsatisfactory during the Second Placement, or for some reason the student is unable to complete the placement, then the University-Based Educator will arrange a meeting where both reflect on the issues and agree a plan of action with the school on how to best to support the student to progress. Where satisfactory progress is made the student will continue on the programme with further advice, support and monitoring. If unsatisfactory progress is made, however, this may result in one of the following recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A referral to a a ‘Fitness to Study’ panel</li>\n<li>carrying out an extended or retrieval placement in another school</li>\n<li>termination of the ITE programme. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the event of the last recommendation, the QMU Board of Examiners may decide that such PGDE students may leave the programme with a Certificate of Professional Education.   Whilst students can appeal against a decision, the only grounds for appeal which may be considered are as outlined in the <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/academic-appeals-regulations/\" title=\"QMU Academic Appeals Regulations Webpage\">University Academic Appeals Procedure</a> There can be no appeal against the professional judgement of the assessors. </p>\n<p>  <em>*PGDE students usually undertake retrieval placements in September and enter the Teacher Induction Scheme the following year</em>. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Deferring a School Placement</span></p>\n<p>Students who are unable for legitimate reasons to undertake the placement at the allotted time or who withdraw from a placement due to ill health and/or personal issues will have a placement arranged at a deferred time. This will count as a first attempt. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Scheduling of a Deferred or Retrieval Placement </span></p>\n<p>Deferred or retrieval placements are dependent on sourcing another placement through the student placement system. For PGDE students all retrieval placements will take place in the next academic year. </p>\n<p> </p>"
