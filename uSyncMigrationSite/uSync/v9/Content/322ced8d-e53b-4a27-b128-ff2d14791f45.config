    "content": "<p><strong>If you intend to apply for a programme of study offered by QMU, you must read the following Terms and Conditions and ensure that you understand them. These Terms and Conditions form the basis of the Contract you will enter into with QMU should you be offered and accept admission to one of our courses.</strong></p>\n<p>1. Every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained in our printed undergraduate prospectus 2025 is accurate at the time of publication (March 2024) and the undergraduate course 2025 entries on our website is accurate at the time posting (March 2024).</p>\n<p>The University will use all reasonable endeavours to provide programmes of study listed in the prospectus/website and to deliver them in accordance with the descriptions of courses set out therein.</p>\n<p>However, as the University is committed to ensuring that courses remain up to date and relevant, it reserves the right to discontinue, merge or combine courses, and to make variations to the content or method of delivery of courses, if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. This, combined with the need to publish the prospectus well in advance, means that changes to the information presented in the prospectus may have occurred. Intending applicants are advised to visit our website at: <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/0bff60db2ad540fead1c46abbf0e58b3}\" title=\"Undergraduate Study\">www.qmu.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study</a>/ or <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">contact admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> before<br />applying.</p>\n<p>The content or curriculum of a course may change for a number of reasons, including that:<br />• the change is required to ensure that the course continues to deliver its key learning outcomes, and the content of the course is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the course;<br />• for courses leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required in order to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration;<br />• the change is not a material change to the content or curriculum;<br />• the change operates for the benefit of the students on the course;<br />• the change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University, and<br />• it is necessary to ensure that the course continues to align with the University’s purpose and strategy.</p>\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative course modules or courses, or the option to transfer to another course at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain courses from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors, including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change.</p>\n<p>The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change in order to assess any impact on students, to mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the<br />academic interests of existing students impacted by any course withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<p>2. The University shall not be liable for failure to perform any its obligations if such failure is caused by any act or event beyond the University’s reasonable control including acts of God, war, terrorism, industrial disputes (including disputes involving the University’s employees), fire, flood, storm, pandemic and national emergencies (“Force Majeure Event”). If the University is the subject of a Force Majeure Event, it will take all reasonable steps to minimise the disruption to students.</p>\n<p>3. An offer of a place to study on a Queen Margaret University course is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to, the procedures of the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full within the University’s website at: <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/c193260b558648f29c85d69c8c088b80}\" title=\"Quality\">www.qmu.ac.uk/about-the-university/quality</a>. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</p>\n<p>4. Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to challenge their fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to fee status be considered after the 14-day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face-to-face contact) have a legal right to cancel the Contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the Contract within 14 days of acceptance, they must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14-day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14-day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the Contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the Contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may remain liable for all or part of the tuition fees payable by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University procedures. The University may cancel the Contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<p>5. Tuition fees are payable for all courses and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Consumer Prices Index at the March immediately preceding the start of the relevant academic session, and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/781a0772d20b4e7091629a2db90d5926}\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Details of tuition fees and other charges can be found here.</a> </p>\n<p>All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until their tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student’s access to university facilities, including IT access, being restricted or denied. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred while on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority, but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</p>\n<p>6. For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made by the University, where applicable, in respect of reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/781a0772d20b4e7091629a2db90d5926}\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges page</a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<p>7. Unless stated otherwise, for example our fully online programmes (where fees are paid in advance), tuition fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be<br />completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students, a new direct debit form is required for each year of study. If tuition fees remain unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21-day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>8. The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p>9. Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. Applicants for certain courses of study must declare all criminal convictions at the point of application, and in these cases, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these courses will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent. In line with mandatory requirements for Scottish Universities, applicants to all courses must disclose relevant unspent criminal convictions and relevant live criminal procedures (charges) at the post-offer stage as well as annually on re-enrolment. If an applicant ha any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction or charge may have on their application, they must contact the Head of Admissions who will be able to advise accordingly. For more information on how we collect, store and use data relating to criminal convictions and charges please see our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/d7b2a2ab0bd14713a87ee1cb75e8c81c}\" title=\"Prospective Students Privacy Statement\">Privacy Notice for Prospective Students.</a></p>\n<p>10. To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous</p>\n<p>12 months or any live criminal procedures, including charges. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within, particular courses may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified this self declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>11. While courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p>12. The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p>13. Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the UK General Data Protection Regulations and the Data Protection Act (2018). This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the Contract between it and the student. As part of the Contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies. Full details of the way in which the University uses students’ information are provided in the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/46a0cb27796b427ea31cbec5735f8195}\" title=\"QMU Student Privacy Statement\">Student Privacy Statement</a>.</p>"

This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. Queen Margaret University would be failing in its legal duty to protect the health, safety, and welfare of staff, students, and visitors if it did not seek to minimise the exposure of smokers and non-smokers to all forms of smoking (including the use of e-cigarettes/vapes). Therefore, smoking and vaping are prohibited in and within 5 metres (15 feet) of any University building, entrance, doorway, or window. Designated smoking areas are signposted throughout campus. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>4. Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to challenge their fee status.

Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course.

However, as the University is committed to ensuring that courses remain up to date and relevant, it reserves the right to discontinue, merge or combine courses, and to make variations to the content or method of delivery of courses, if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. This, combined with the need to publish the prospectus well in advance, means that changes to the information presented in the prospectus may have occurred. Intending applicants are advised to visit the University website: <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/0bff60db2ad540fead1c46abbf0e58b3}\" title=\"Undergraduate Study\">QMU UG Study page</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> before applying. The content or curriculum of a course may change for a number of reasons, including that:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>the change is required to ensure that the course continues to deliver its key learning outcomes, and the content of the course is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the course;</li>\n<li>for courses leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required in order to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration;</li>\n<li>the change is not a material change to the content or curriculum;</li>\n<li>the change operates for the benefit of the students on the course;</li>\n<li>the change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University, and</li>\n<li>it is necessary to ensure that the course continues to align with the University’s purpose and strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative course modules or courses, or the option to transfer to another course at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain courses from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors, including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change. The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change in order to assess any impact on students, to mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the academic interests of existing students impacted by any course withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The University shall not be liable for failure to perform any its obligations if such failure is caused by any act or event beyond the University’s reasonable control including acts of God, war, terrorism, industrial disputes (including disputes involving the University’s employees), fire, flood, storm, pandemic and national emergencies (“Force Majeure Event”). If the University is the subject of a Force Majeure Event, it will take all reasonable steps to minimise the disruption to students.</li>\n<li>An offer of a place to study on a Queen Margaret University course is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to, the procedures of the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full within the University’s website at: <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/d5feb49017f1475089ec93d5ab994fe1}\" title=\"Regulations, Policies and Procedures\">QMU Regulations webpage</a></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The University is currently reviewing its policies with a view to achieving this aspiration. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</span></li>\n<li>Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to challenge their fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to fee status be considered after the 14-day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face-to-face contact) have a legal right to cancel the Contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the Contract within 14 days of acceptance, they must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14-day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14-day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the Contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the Contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may remain liable for all or part of the tuition fees payable by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University procedures. The University may cancel the Contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</li>\n<li>Tuition fees are payable for all courses and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Consumer Prices Index at the March immediately preceding the start of the relevant academic session, and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year. Details of tuition fees and other charges can be found on our website at:</li>\n<li><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/781a0772d20b4e7091629a2db90d5926}\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Tuition Fees and Charges</a> and on pages 132 - 133 in this prospectus. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until their tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred while on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority, but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</li>\n<li>For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made by the University, where applicable, in respect of reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out at: <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/781a0772d20b4e7091629a2db90d5926}\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Tuition Fees and Charges</a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</li>\n<li>Unless stated otherwise eg fully on-line programmes where fees are paid in advance, Tuition fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students, a new direct debit form is required for each year of study. If tuition fees remain unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21-day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</li>\n<li>The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</li>\n<li>Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. Applicants for certain courses of study must declare all criminal convictions at the point of application, and in these cases, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these courses will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent. Applicants to all other courses must disclose unspent criminal convictions at the point when they accept their offer. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on their application, they must contact the Head of Admissions who will be able to advise accordingly.</li>\n<li>To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within, particular courses may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified this self-declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</li>\n<li>While courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</li>\n<li>The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</li>\n<li>Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the UK General Data Protection Regulations and the Data Protection Act (2018). This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the Contract between it and the student. As part of the Contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies. Full details of the way in which the University uses students’ information are provided in the Student Privacy Statement which is published on the University website at: <a href=\"/footer/privacy-statement/\"></a><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/46a0cb27796b427ea31cbec5735f8195}\" title=\"QMU Student Privacy Statement\">Student Privacy Statement</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>"

If the University is the subject of a Force Majeure Event, it will take all reasonable steps to minimise the disruption to students.</p>\n<p>3. An offer of a place to study on a Queen Margaret University course is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to, the procedures of the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full within the University’s website at: <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/c193260b558648f29c85d69c8c088b80}\" title=\"Quality\">www.qmu.ac.uk/about-the-university/quality</a>. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply.

Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face-to-face contact) have a legal right to cancel the Contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the Contract within 14 days of acceptance, they must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14-day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14-day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the Contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the Contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may remain liable for all or part of the tuition fees payable by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University procedures. The University may cancel the Contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<p>5.

Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The University is currently reviewing its policies with a view to achieving this aspiration. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</p>\n<p>4. Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to challenge their fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to fee status be considered after the 14-day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face-to-face contact) have a legal right to cancel the Contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the Contract within 14 days of acceptance, they must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14-day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14-day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the Contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the Contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may remain liable for all or part of the tuition fees payable by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University procedures. The University may cancel the Contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<p>5. Tuition fees are payable for all courses and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Retail Prices Index and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year. Details of tuition fees and other charges can be found on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/781a0772d20b4e7091629a2db90d5926}\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges page</a>. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until their tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred while on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority, but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</p>\n<p>6. For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made, where applicable, in respect of reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/781a0772d20b4e7091629a2db90d5926}\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges page</a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<p>7. Tuition fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students, a new direct debit form is required for each year of study. If students experience payment difficulties resulting in tuition fees remaining unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21-day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>8. The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p>9. Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. Applicants for certain courses of study must declare all criminal convictions at the point of application, and in these cases, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these courses will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent. Applicants to all other courses are asked to disclose unspent criminal convictions at the point when they accept their offer. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on their application, they must contact the Head of Admissions who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p>10. To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within, particular courses may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified this self-declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>11. While courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p>12. The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p>13. Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the UK General Data Protection Regulations and the Data Protection Act (2018). This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the Contract between it and the student. As part of the Contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies. Full details of the way in which the University uses students’ information are provided in the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/46a0cb27796b427ea31cbec5735f8195}\" title=\"QMU Student Privacy Statement\">Student Privacy Statement</a>.</p>"

Every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained in this prospectus is accurate at the time of publication (October 2021). The University will use all reasonable endeavours to provide programmes of study listed in the prospectus and to deliver them in accordance with the descriptions of courses set out therein. However, as the University is committed to ensuring that courses remain up to date and relevant, it reserves the right to discontinue, merge or combine courses, and to make variations to the content or method of delivery of courses, if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. This, combined with the need to publish the prospectus well in advance, means that changes to the information presented in the prospectus may have occurred. Intending applicants are advised to visit our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/459150c020bb424c89d61a42547ec50d}\" title=\"Course A-Z\">Course A-Z page</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a>  before applying. The content or curriculum of a course may change for a number of reasons, including that:<br />• the change is required to ensure that the course continues to deliver its key learning outcomes, and the content of the course is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the course;<br />• for courses leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required in order to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration;<br />• the change is not a material change to the content or curriculum;<br />• the change operates for the benefit of the students on the course;<br />• the change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University, and<br />• it is necessary to ensure that the course continues to align with the University’s purpose and strategy.</p>\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative course modules or courses, or the option to transfer to another course at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain courses from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors, including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change. The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change, in order to assess any impact on students, to mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the academic interests of existing students impacted by any course withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<p>2. The University shall not be liable for failure to perform any its obligations if such failure is caused by any act or event beyond the University’s reasonable control including acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemic, industrial disputes (including disputes involving the University’s employees), fire, flood, storm, pandemic and national emergencies (“Force Majeure Event”). If the University is the subject of a Force Majeure Event, it will take all reasonable steps to minimise the disruption to students.</p>\n<p>3. An offer of a place to study on a Queen Margaret University course is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to, the procedures of the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full on the <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality\" title=\"Quality at QMU\">Quality section of our website</a><a href=\"/about-the-university/quality\"></a>. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply.

Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21-day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students<br />who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p><br />8. The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p><br />9. Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an<br />individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. Applicants for certain courses of study must declare all criminal convictions at the<br />point of application, and in these cases, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these courses will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent. Applicants to all other courses are asked to disclose unspent criminal convictions at the point<br />when they accept their offer. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on his/her application, they must contact the Head of Admissions and Recruitment who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p><br />10. To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within, particular courses may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified this self-declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p><br />11. While courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p><br />12. The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular,<br />the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p><br />13. Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the General Data Protection Regulations and the Data protection Act (2018). This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the Contract between it and the student. As part of the Contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies. Full details of the way in which the University uses students’ information are provided in the Student Privacy Statement which is<br />issued as part of the matriculation.</p>"

These Terms and Conditions form the basis of the contract you will enter into with QMU should you be offered and accept a place with us.</p>\n<p>1.<br />Every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained in this prospectus is accurate at the time of publication (February 2020). The University will use all reasonable endeavours to provide programmes of study listed in the prospectus and to deliver them in accordance with the descriptions of programmes set out. However, as the University is committed to ensuring that programmes remain up to date and relevant, it reserves the right to discontinue, merge or combine programmes and to make variations to the content or method of delivery of programmes, if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. This, combined with the need to publish the prospectus well in advance, means that changes to the information presented in the prospectus may have occurred. Intending applicants are advised to visit the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/459150c020bb424c89d61a42547ec50d}\" title=\"Course A-Z\">University website</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> before applying. The content curriculum of a course may change for a number of reasons, including that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The change is required to ensure that the course continues to deliver its key learning outcomes and the content of the course is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the course.</li>\n<li>For courses leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration.</li>\n<li>The change is not a material change to the content or curriculum.</li>\n<li>The change operates for the benefit of the students on the course.</li>\n<li>The change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University, and</li>\n<li>It is necessary to ensure that the programmes continue to align with the University’s aims, strategy and mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative course modules or courses, or the option to transfer to another course at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain programmes from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change. The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change in order to assess any impact on students and mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the academic interests of existing students impacted by any programme withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<p>2. The University shall not be liable for failure to perform any its obligations if such failure is caused by any act or event beyond the University's reasonable control including acts of God, war, terrorism, industrial disputes (including disputes involving the University's employees), fire, flood, storm and national emergencies (\"Force Majeure Event\"). If the University is the subject of a Force Majeure Event, it will take all reasonable steps to minimise the disruption to students.</p>\n<p>3. An offer of a place at the University is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to the procedures of, the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full within the <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality\" title=\"Quality at QMU\">Quality section of our website</a>. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector; and more broadly to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The University is currently reviewing its Policies with a view to achieving this aspiration. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</p>\n<p>4.<br />Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to enter a course to challenge their fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to fee status be considered after the 14-day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face to face contact) have a legal right to cancel the contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the contract within 14 days of acceptance, he or she must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14-day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14-day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may remain liable for all or part of the tuition fees paid by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University procedures. The University may cancel the contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<p>5.<br />Tuition fees are payable for all courses and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Retail Prices Index and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year. Details of tuition fees and other charges can be found on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a> and on pages 162-163 in this prospectus. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until his or her tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred while on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</p>\n<p>6.<br />For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made in respect of graduation and, where applicable, reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<p>7.<br />Tuition fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students a new Direct Debit form is required for each year of study. If tuition fees remain unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding eight weeks after the end of the 21-day period, or where an instalment is over four weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>8.<br />The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p>9.<br />Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. Applicants to whom an offer to enter a course has been made may be asked to disclose criminal convictions in order to help safeguard the welfare of our students. Applicants for certain courses of study must declare all criminal convictions at the point of application, and in such circumstances, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these courses will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on his her application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p>10.<br />To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within, particular courses, may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified this self-declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>&lt;p\"&gt;11.<br />While courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p>12.<br />The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p>13.<br />Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation. This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the contract between it and the student. As part of the contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies.

Intending applicants are advised to visit the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/459150c020bb424c89d61a42547ec50d}\" title=\"Course A-Z\">University website</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> before applying. The content curriculum of a course may change for a number of reasons, including that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The change is required to ensure that the course continues to deliver its key learning outcomes and the content of the course is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the course.</li>\n<li>For courses leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration.</li>\n<li>The change is not a material change to the content or curriculum.</li>\n<li>The change operates for the benefit of the students on the course.</li>\n<li>The change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University, and</li>\n<li>It is necessary to ensure that the programmes continue to align with the University’s aims, strategy and mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative course modules or courses, or the option to transfer to another course at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain programmes from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change. The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change in order to assess any impact on students and mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the academic interests of existing students impacted by any programme withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<p>2. The University shall not be liable for failure to perform any its obligations if such failure is caused by any act or event beyond the University's reasonable control including acts of God, war, terrorism, industrial disputes (including disputes involving the University's employees), fire, flood, storm and national emergencies (\"Force Majeure Event\"). If the University is the subject of a Force Majeure Event, it will take all reasonable steps to minimise the disruption to students.</p>\n<p>3. An offer of a place at the University is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to the procedures of, the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full on the <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality\" title=\"Quality at QMU\">Quality section of our website</a>. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector; and more broadly to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The University is currently reviewing its Policies with a view to achieving this aspiration. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</p>\n<p>4.<br />Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to enter a course to challenge their fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to fee status be considered after the 14-day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face to face contact) have a legal right to cancel the contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the contract within 14 days of acceptance, he or she must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14-day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14-day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may remain liable for all or part of the tuition fees paid by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University procedures. The University may cancel the contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<p>5.<br />Tuition fees are payable for all courses and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Retail Prices Index and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year. Details of tuition fees and other charges can be found on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a> and on pages 162-163 in this prospectus. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until his or her tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred while on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</p>\n<p>6.<br />For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made in respect of graduation and, where applicable, reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out at <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<p>7.<br />Tuition fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students a new Direct Debit form is required for each year of study. If tuition fees remain unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding eight weeks after the end of the 21-day period, or where an instalment is over four weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>8.<br />The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p>9.<br />Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. Applicants to whom an offer to enter a course has been made may be asked to disclose criminal convictions in order to help safeguard the welfare of our students. Applicants for certain courses of study must declare all criminal convictions at the point of application, and in such circumstances, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these courses will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on his her application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p>10.<br />To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within, particular courses, may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified this self-declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>11.<br />While courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p>12.<br />The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p>13.<br />Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation. This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the contract between it and the student. As part of the contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies. Full details of the way in which the University uses students’ information are provided in the Student Privacy Notice which is issued as part of the matriculation process.</p>"

Details of tuition fees and other charges can be found on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a> and on pages 170-171 in this prospectus. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until his or her tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred while on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</p>\n<p>6.<br />For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made in respect of graduation and, where applicable, reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<p>7.<br />Tuition fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students a new Direct Debit form is required for each year of study. If students experience payment difficulties resulting in tuition fees remaining unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21-day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>8.<br />The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p>9.<br />Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on their application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. All applicants are asked to disclose criminal convictions to help safeguard the welfare of our students. Applicants for certain programmes of study must declare all criminal convictions, and in these cases the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these programmes will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland or an appropriate equivalent. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on his her application, they must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p>10.<br />To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within particular courses, may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified this self-declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>11.<br />While courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p>12.<br />The University does not accept responsibility, and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to their property, whether in connection with their studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p>13.<br />Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the Data Protection Act 1998, and any successor legislation including the General Data Protection Regulation. This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the contract between it and the student. As part of the contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies. Full details of the way in which the University uses students’ information are provided in the Data Protection statement which is issued as part of the matriculation process.</p>"

These Terms and Conditions form the basis of the contract you will enter into with QMU should you be offered and accept a place with us.</strong></p>\n<p>1.<br />Every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained in this prospectus is accurate at the time of publication (July 2017). The University will use all reasonable endeavours to provide courses of study listed in the prospectus and to deliver them in accordance with the descriptions of courses set out. However, as the University is committed to ensuring that courses remain up to date and relevant, it reserves the right to discontinue, merge or combine courses and to make variations to the content or method of delivery of courses , if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. This, combined with the need to publish the prospectus well in advance, means that changes to the information presented in the prospectus may have occurred.</p>\n<p>Intending applicants are advised to visit the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/459150c020bb424c89d61a42547ec50d}\" title=\"Course A-Z\">University website</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a>  before applying. The content curriculum of a course may change for a number of reasons, including that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The change is required to ensure that the course continues to deliver its key learning outcomes and the content of the course is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the course;</li>\n<li>For courses leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration;</li>\n<li>The change is not a material change to the content or curriculum;</li>\n<li>The change operates for the benefit of the students on the course;</li>\n<li>The change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University;</li>\n<li>It is necessary to ensure that the programmes continue to align with the University’s aims, strategy and mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative course modules or courses or the option to transfer to another course at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain courses from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change. The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change in order to assess any impact on students and mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the academic interests of existing students impacted by any programme withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<p>2.<br />In the event of external factors, such as industrial action, the University undertakes to minimise any disruption that may subsequently arise, as far as is practicable.</p>\n<p>3.<br />An offer of a place at the University is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to the procedures of, the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full within the <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality\" title=\"Quality at QMU\">Quality section of the University’s website</a>. We recommend that you also read the University’s ‘<a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/essential-information/\" title=\"Essential information for students\">Essential Information for Students</a>’. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University. If you intend to apply for a place at QMU, you must read the following Terms and Conditions and ensure that you understand them. These Terms and Conditions form the basis of the contract you will enter into with QMU should you be offered and accept a place at Queen Margaret University. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The University from time to time reviews its Smoking Policy with a view to achieving this aspiration. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</p>\n<p>4.<br />Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to challenge their Fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to Fee status be considered after the 14 day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face to face contact) have a legal right to cancel the contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer. Where an applicant wishes to cancel the contract within 14 days of acceptance, he or she must do so by informing the University in writing. Where an applicant cancels within the 14 day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full. Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14 day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure. Where the contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may lose all or part of the tuition fees paid by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University Procedures. The University may cancel the contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<p>5.<br />Tuition fees are payable for all courses and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Retail Prices Index and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year. Details on tuition fees and other charges can be found on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a>. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until his or her tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony, or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment.

The University will use all reasonable endeavours to provide programmes of study listed in the prospectus and to deliver them in accordance with the descriptions of programmes set out. However, as the University is committed to ensuring that programmes remain up to date and relevant, it reserves the right to discontinue, merge or combine programmes and to make variations to the content or method of delivery of programmes, if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. This, combined with the need to publish the prospectus well in advance, means that changes to the information presented in the prospectus may have occurred. Intending applicants are advised to visit the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/459150c020bb424c89d61a42547ec50d}\" title=\"Course A-Z\">University website</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> before applying. The content curriculum of a course may change for a number of reasons, including that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The change is required to ensure that the course continues to deliver its key learning outcomes and the content of the course is responsive to changes and developments in the areas covered by the course;</li>\n<li>For courses leading to professional qualifications, accreditation or registration, the changes are required to continue to satisfy pre-requisites of a particular professional or regulatory body responsible for awarding such qualification, accreditation or registration;</li>\n<li>The change is not a material change to the content or curriculum;</li>\n<li>The change operates for the benefit of the students on the course;</li>\n<li>The change is required due to circumstances outside the control of the University;</li>\n<li>It is necessary to ensure that the programmes continue to align with the University’s aims, strategy and mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remedies for students impacted by any such change may include, but are not limited to, provision of alternative course modules or courses or the option to transfer to another course at the University. It may be desirable or necessary to withdraw certain programmes from the University’s portfolio of provision as a result of a number of factors including changes in patterns of demand from prospective students, changes in staffing, a strategic realignment of the University’s portfolio or a major organisational change. The University will use its best endeavours to consult meaningfully with students who would be affected by any such change in order to assess any impact on students and mitigate any disruption arising from the change and to identify appropriate alternative arrangements. Arrangements to support the academic interests of existing students impacted by any programme withdrawal will be put in place. In all cases, the University will make every effort to advise students at the earliest possible opportunity of any changes to the course content or curriculum that may impact upon them.</p>\n<p>2.<br />In the event of external factors, such as industrial action, the University undertakes to minimise any disruption that may subsequently arise, as far as is practicable.</p>\n<p>3.<br />An offer of a place at the University is made on the understanding that, in accepting the offer, the student undertakes to observe and comply with these Terms and Conditions and to abide by, and to submit to the procedures of, the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct, as amended from time to time. The University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct are set out in full within the <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality\" title=\"Quality at QMU\">Quality section of the University’s website</a>. Changes to the University’s Regulations may be made from time to time for one or more of the following reasons: to reflect changes to the statutory requirements with which the University is required to comply; to reflect best practice regulation across the higher education sector and more broadly; to ensure that the University’s Regulations remain fit for purpose as a result of changes or developments within the University and across the higher education sector. Where the University’s regulations are changed and the operation of a new regulation would place a student in a less favourable position than they would otherwise have been under the old regulations, that student may rely on the old regulation as if it continued to apply. Whether a student would be in a less favourable position is a matter to be determined by the University on a case by case basis depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular student. This would not apply to a situation where the new regulations seek to address a previously unregulated matter. All policies and procedures are subject to regular review and formal approval by the appropriate committee. The University Court has agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The University is currently reviewing its Smoking Policy with a view to achieving this aspiration. Students’ attention shall be drawn to any amendments to policy in this area.</p>\n<p>4.<br />Applicants will have 14 days from receipt of their offer to challenge their Fee status. Only exceptionally will changes to Fee status be considered after the 14 day period. Applicants who accept an offer by distance communication (for example, via UCAS or online, without face to face contact) have a legal right to cancel the contract at any time within 14 days of the date of acceptance of the offer.  Where an applicant wishes to cancel the contract within 14 days of acceptance, he or she must do so by informing the University in writing.  Where an applicant cancels within the 14 day period after acceptance, any advance payment made by that applicant shall be refunded in full.  Notwithstanding the aforementioned rights to cancel within the initial 14 day period from acceptance, applicants may withdraw from study at the University, and cancel the contract at any time after registration, by following the University’s withdrawal procedure.  Where the contract is cancelled in this way, applicants may lose all or part of the tuition fees paid by them or on their behalf, in accordance with University Procedures.  The University may cancel the contract at any time in accordance with the University’s Regulations, Policies and Codes of Conduct.</p>\n<p>5.<br />Tuition fees are payable for all courses and are subject to review annually. Tuition fees for new and existing students are liable to increase each year as a result of review. For continuing students, any increase in the level of fee each year will be subject to a maximum percentage equivalent to the higher of the annual increase in the UK Retail Prices Index and 5%. Factors that will determine the need for, and extent of, any increase include any increase set or prescribed by regulatory bodies such as the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Government, Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and the UK Government, and/or increases in the costs of delivering and administering the course. Tuition fees for the forthcoming academic session are published on the QMU website well in advance of the start of that academic year. Details on tuition fees and other charges can be found on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a>. All students who are continuing with their studies should review their fee rates prior to starting their next academic session. No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until his or her tuition fees have been paid in full, or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony, or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred whilst on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</p>\n<p>6.<br />For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made in respect of graduation and, where applicable, reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out at on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<p>7.<br />Tuition Fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students a new Direct Debit form is required for each year of study. If students experience payment difficulties resulting in tuition fees remaining unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student  encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21 day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>8.<br />The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p>9.<br />Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on his/her application, he/she must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. All applicants are asked to disclose criminal convictions to help safeguard the welfare of our students. Applicants for certain programmes of study must declare all criminal convictions, and in these cases the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these programmes will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland, or an appropriate equivalent. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on his/her application, he/she must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p>10.<br />To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within particular programmes may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified his/her self declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>11.<br />Whilst courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p>12.<br />The University does not accept responsibility and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to his/her property, whether in connection with his/ her studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p>13.<br />Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the Data Protection Act (1998).

No student will be permitted to attend a graduation ceremony, or to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees for all preceding years have been paid in full. Failure to settle tuition fees by the due date may lead to a student being excluded from attendance at classes. Ensuring tuition fees are paid is the responsibility of the student and, in the event of a student’s sponsoring authority refusing or failing to make payment in full or in part, the student will be held personally liable for payment. Students will also be liable for any travel and accommodation costs incurred whilst on placement. Such costs may be paid by a sponsoring authority but should a sponsoring authority refuse or fail to do so, the student will be personally liable for such costs.</p>\n<p>6.<br />For some courses, an additional fee may be payable in respect of registration with a professional body. Additional charges will be made in respect of graduation and, where applicable, reassessment. Full details of registration fees and other charges are set out atn the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\" title=\"Fees and Charges\">Fees and Charges section of our website</a><a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/fees-and-charges\"></a> and students are also personally liable for such fees.</p>\n<p>7.<br />Tuition Fees become due on the first day of study and should be paid within 21 days of the due date, or an arrangement made with the Finance Office for payment to be made by instalments. Where a student has opted to pay by instalments, a direct debit mandate must be completed prior to, or at the time of, matriculation. For returning students a new Direct Debit form is required for each year of study. If students experience payment difficulties resulting in tuition fees remaining unpaid for 21 days after falling due, interest on the full amount at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate may be charged. Where payment is being made by instalments, interest will run on an instalment from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid. Where a student  encounters difficulty in paying tuition fees, they are required to contact the Credit Controller at the University Finance Office for assistance in drawing up a payment schedule. Any payment schedule drawn up by the Credit Controller must be adhered to by the student until the fees in question are paid in full. Where no payment schedule has been arranged with the Credit Controller and tuition fees remain outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21 day period, or where an instalment is over 4 weeks late, a student may be asked to leave the University and the debt shall be transferred to a debt collector. If outstanding fees are then paid prior to the end of the academic year, the University may permit a student to be reinstated. However, where the University agrees to such a reinstatement, a student may be required to repeat parts of any course which have been missed, resulting in additional fees being incurred. Students who leave the University more than 28 days after the start of a programme of study will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee, based on semesters attended in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>8.<br />The University may withdraw or amend its offer or terminate a student’s registration at the University if it finds that a false or materially misleading statement has been made in, or significant information has been omitted from, a student’s application form.</p>\n<p>9.<br />Admission to some degree courses offered by the University, and to some of the professions for which it provides training, may be precluded by certain medical conditions. Students are obliged to include information regarding any medical condition, past or present, which may affect their participation on a course when completing their UCAS or Queen Margaret University application form. If an individual has any doubt as to the effect that a medical or health-related condition may have on his/her application, he/she must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly. The University does not warrant or guarantee that a student admitted to a particular course will necessarily be allowed to complete the course if the student subsequently suffers from or contracts any material medical or health condition. All applicants are asked to disclose criminal convictions to help safeguard the welfare of our students. Applicants for certain programmes of study must declare all criminal convictions, and in these cases the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply. As a condition of entry, candidates for these programmes will be required to provide a satisfactory Enhanced Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, Disclosure Scotland, or an appropriate equivalent. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on his/her application, he/she must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p>10.<br />To safeguard the welfare of staff, students, visitors and the general public, the University scrutinises all criminal convictions declared by applicants. Continuing students must declare at the point of matriculation any criminal conviction acquired in the previous 12 months. The existence of a criminal conviction itself does not preclude entry to the University, but admission to, or progression within particular programmes may be precluded by certain types of convictions. Any student who is found to have falsified his/her self declaration at the point of application or at matriculation will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>11.<br />Whilst courses are designed to prepare students for employment, the University does not warrant or guarantee that students will obtain employment as a result of successfully completing any course.</p>\n<p>12.<br />The University does not accept responsibility and expressly excludes all liability, to the full extent permitted by law, for any loss, damage or injury incurred by a student or to his/her property, whether in connection with his/ her studies or not, except in circumstances where the student has suffered personal injury or death caused by the negligence of the University or its employees. In particular, the University shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, any computer or electronic data or information owned or used by a student.</p>\n<p>13.<br />Personal information on students will be held and processed according to the Data Protection Act (1998). This information will be used by the University to fulfil its part of the contract between it and the student. As part of the contract, the University is also required to release certain information on the student population to government agencies.</p>\n<p>14.<br />Every matriculated student is automatically a member of the Students' Union. However under the 1994 Education Act, students have the right to opt out of being a member should they wish.</p>"

No student will be deemed to be fully matriculated until his or her fees have been paid in full or satisfactory evidence is produced that such fees will be paid by a sponsoring authority. No student will be permitted to graduate nor to proceed to the next year of their course until tuition fees and/or any outstanding debts to QMU for all preceding years have been paid in full.

This arises from UK government legislation, and will apply to all courses of this nature offered throughout the UK. QMU has a code of practice and copies are available from the Director of Registry and Secretariat on request. If an applicant has any doubt as to the effect a criminal conviction may have on his/her application, he/she must contact the course Admissions Tutor who will be able to advise accordingly.</p>\n<p><br />9.
