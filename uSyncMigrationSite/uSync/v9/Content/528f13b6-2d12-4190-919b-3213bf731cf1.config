      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This is a summary of a small evaluation project undertaken during 2020 to follow up on the impact on practice, if any, attendance on one of Queen Margaret University’s accredited short courses and qualifications on complaint handling practice may have had. It builds on an<strong> <a href="/{localLink:umb://media/06bc37ad38fc47178ab7de18b2c80d70}" title="Phase1 Impact Research Report Final December18">evaluation previously undertaken in 2018</a></strong> (QMU 2018).</p>
<p>The research consisted of a detailed questionnaire survey sent to 72 complaint handlers in the UK who in 2019 had undertaken either the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional Award in Ombudsman and Complaint Handling Practice OR</li>
<li>Public Services Complaint Management Award</li>
</ul>
<p>The questionnaire asked them to evaluate the impact, if any, undertaking these accredited qualifications had on their:</p>
<p>(a) personal complaint handling practice and <br />(b) organisation’s complaint handling practice.</p>
<p>This report summarises the findings and draws on qualitative comments from 11 complaint handlers who provided more detailed feedback in the survey on the impact of undertaking these courses.</p>]]></Value>
