      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Pamela has worked in senior leadership roles in both strategic and operational roles in non-executive and executive positions. During her varied career, she has held high ranking positions in a number of sectors including in economic development, housing and international development, as well as in both further and higher education.</p>
<p>With significant governance experience gained over the last 20 years, Pamela was elected to the post of Chair of Court by the University’s students and staff, following a competitive application and interview process overseen by membership of the Court. Previously, she was a member of the Court of Edinburgh Napier University – five years of which she served as Vice Chair.</p>
<p>Outside education, Pamela has chaired the board of a major housing organisation and has worked to support social enterprise and charitable organisations. Earlier in her career she was Senior Director of the government agency, Scottish Enterprise, and held a number of strategic and operational roles.</p>
<p>Aligning with Queen Margaret University’s specialisms, throughout her career Pamela has supported Scottish companies in key industries such as tourism, food and drink, creative industries and financial services. She has also worked with Business Gateway to support small businesses; and has a passion for nutrition, health and wellbeing, as well as supporting entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Pamela Woodburn said: “I am excited to be joining the Court at this point as we begin to emerge out of the pandemic. The full societal impacts of COVID-19 will not be realised for many years, but I am confident QMU will continue to adapt and respond innovatively to the opportunities and challenges ahead.”</p>
<p>Sir Paul Grice, Principal of Queen Margaret University, said: “I know that Pamela will bring great experience, expertise and commitment to the role of Chair of Court. I am very much looking forward to working with her in leading the university through the challenges ahead.”</p>]]></Value>
