      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Mhairi Coyle, a P2 pupil at St Martins RC Primary School, Tranent, and Rachel Teschner, a P6 pupil at Musselburgh Burgh Primary School, Musselburgh, were selected to have their art work showcased on the Queen Margaret University Christmas card.</p>
<p>Six year old Mhairi and Rachel who is 10 are also students with the Queen Margaret Children’s University. It is the first time that Queen Margaret University has held a Christmas card competition with the Children’s University and the Principal, who is an artist herself, was really pleased to be able to highlight the children’s colourful designs on QMU’s 2016 Christmas card.</p>
<p>Both Mhairi and Rachel’s designs are now being used by Queen Margaret University staff who are sending season’s greetings to friends and colleagues in both the UK and internationally. The cards will be shared with University’s education partners in Nepal, India, Greece and Singapore and with other QMU contacts based all over the world. The cards have been printed on paper and are also available for staff on a digital format for sharing electronically and via social media.</p>
<p>Hayley Jones, Queen Margaret Children’s University Officer, said: “The competition was really successful with many children sharing their artwork with us. We were really impressed with the range of designs and creativity from the children, but eventually we settled on our two winning designs which featured traditional Christmas images – Santa and robins.”</p>
<p>The winners have both received a letter from Professor Petra Wend, QMU Principal, as well as a £10 Waterstones voucher and a pack of cards. Packs of the Christmas cards can be bought in the University shop on campus and proceeds from their sale will go to the Queen Margaret Children’s University.</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is the first and only higher education institution in the east of Scotland to host a Children’s University. The Queen Margaret Children’s University aims to help school children, become confident learners and broaden their horizons. Since its launch in 2013, the Queen Margaret Children’s University has inspired over 3,000 children aged 5 to 14 years to develop a love of learning.</p>]]></Value>
