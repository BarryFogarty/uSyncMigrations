    "content": "<p>First-rate digital content has one primary quality; it makes us pause and want to look, to hear the message, to discover what happens next. Can the creation of such compelling material be a happy blend of good fortune and good timing. No it’s not: there is a method, and it can be mastered using skills learned on this practically focused course. By understanding the language of film you will learn how to improve content. Along with campaign strategy, you will learn engaging visual storytelling techniques (such as mise-en-scene, continuity and montage) that are essential for effective short documentaries, adverts or dramas. You will also learn key news-media production skills (such as interviewing, managing, producing, directing, shooting and editing short newsworthy film and other digital content).</p>\n<p>Drawing on QMU’s existing portfolio of courses in PR, film and media, this new course has been inspired by the professional experiences of our academic staff. Our media production lecturers have won a host of international awards for their short films and are highly successful on social media. Our PR and communications lecturers have professional and personal campaign experience and are involved with a range of campaigning organisations. This experience is at the centre of our teaching approach and we always engage students in producing real strategies and content for real clients. This results in campaigns where video and digital content have had a profound effect on audiences and have been crucial in achieving strategic aims and objectives.</p>"

They take a critical perspective to ethics, social responsibility and social justice and explore how strategic communication can impact on society.  Theory is applied to produce creative communication campaigns including a range of communication activities and digital tactics.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Storytelling for Media Campaigns (20 credits):</strong> <span>The art of storytelling is as old as the human race itself and our earliest forms of communication were deeply visual in nature. Even today, that hasn’t changed. In fact, if anything, having a mastery of visual storytelling techniques has become more important than ever. The success of our campaigning, marketing, advertising, and much of our digital entertainment relies on a solid understanding of such skills. </span> <span>This module will facilitate critical understanding of narrative techniques and enable students to plan, manage and produce campaign films, appropriate for submission to an organisation, client or broadcaster.</span> <span>The assessment is an Individual production project (a short documentary or a number of adverts or a drama film related to a client’s campaign).  </span></p>\n<p><strong>Digital Content Creation for Campaigns (20 credits):</strong> <span>Students will explore and practice techniques of digital content production for a client / organisation using digital capture devices &amp; editing software to produce finished projects.</span> <span>This module will focus on factual media content. Students investigate and report on hard news, soft news documentary as well as developing production material. Techniques of news gathering including interview techniques and reporting are covered. This includes all aspects of video production, as well as journalism, feature photography and dissemination via print and online media. </span><span>Students will be introduced to most available digital formats and shown how to upload visual digital content to online channels and social media.</span> </p>\n<p><strong>Digital Communications (20 credits):</strong> The evolution, diffusion, and adoption of digital technologies have fundamentally altered the way we live, work, relate to one another, and conduct business. These technological and societal changes are having a far-reaching impact on the communications, public relations and marketing disciplines, presenting huge challenges as well as opportunities to the industry. This module provides a sound theoretical and practical knowledge of digital communications based on a critical understanding of current and emerging technologies, digital strategies and social media platforms. The module examines a number of topics including: digital strategy; social media; search engine optimisation; online community building and management; stakeholders analysis; issues management; web analytics and big data; content marketing; web design; online customer journey; ethical and legal aspects of digital communications; and more. </p>\n<p>The modules listed are correct at time of posting (October 2021) but are subject to change. In the event that modules change, QMU will seek to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that there is no detrimental impact on students.</p>"
