      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>14.1     Component</strong></p>
<p>A component is defined as an individual piece of assessment, for example an examination or an essay. Some modules will have one assessment component only. Others may have multiple components.</p>
<p><strong>14.2     Reassessment   </strong>        </p>
<p>Reassessment means the opportunity to be reassessed in an assessment component which has been failed. The timing of the reassessment is at the discretion of the Board of Examiners but must allow the student sufficient time to prepare. Normally reassessment (as a second attempt) happens within the same academic year or shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>A student will be permitted a maximum of three attempts at any module. i.e. attempt one plus two reassessment attempts. Attempt three may be undertaken in the following academic year subject to progression regulations.</p>
<p><em>NB MSc/PgDip Occupational Therapy (Pre-Registration) students - see <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/67a539703f67425ea61090fdff30cc93}" title="AR7 Programme exceptions">Programme Exceptions</a></em></p>
<p><strong>14.3     Condonement of a module</strong></p>
<p>Condonement of a module may occur where a student has not achieved a minimum pass mark in an undergraduate module at SCQF level 7 or SCQF level 8 and there are no programme specific assessment regulations that require the student to be reassessed.</p>

    "content": "<p>17.1     Student progression from one level of the programme to the next is at the discretion of the Board of Examiners taking into account the student’s performance in all modules and the amount of academic credit accrued during the year.</p>\n<p>17.2     The main Board of Examiners is responsible for determining:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>whether the student remains in registration;</li>\n<li>the conditions governing the student’s progression;</li>\n<li>the award for which the student is eligible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>17.3     Where there is a tiered system of Boards of Examiners, the Module Board will have the authority to moderate and confirm marks and grades for each of the modules for which it is responsible, and determine the form and timing of any reassessment offered. The decision of the Module Board of Examiners may be overturned by the Progression/Award Board of Examiners following consideration of the full student profile.</p>\n<p>17.4     Boards of Examiners may condone one failed 20 credit module per level at the first attempt for students at level one and level two (SCQF level 7 and 8) of an undergraduate programme, provided that a minimum overall mark of at least 37% has been achieved in the failed module and no individual component of assessment within the module falls below the minimum compensation level. The result will show as a condoned fail on the academic transcript and the student will be given credit for the module. Students who have failed more than 20 credits must undertake reassessments of all failed modules in the first instance. Once reassessment results are known, condonement may still be applied to one 20 credit module, provided that a minimum overall mark of at least 37% has been achieved in the failed module and no individual component of assessment within the module falls below the minimum compensation level and the student has no further failed modules on their profile.</p>\n<p>Programme specific regulations may exempt some modules from eligibility for condonement.</p>\n<p>A condoned fail will not affect any subsequent module selections.</p>\n<p>17.5     Decisions on a student’s continued registration will be made at the end of each</p>\n<p>academic year, after reassessment results are known. The main Board of Examiners will take account of the following guidelines in making their decisions.</p>\n<p>17.6     For undergraduate full-time students:</p>\n<p>a)   Pass modules rated to a total of 80 or more credits – continue in registration as a full-time student</p>\n<p>Normally full-time students undertake 120 credits in an academic year. Exceptionally, full-time students can take a maximum of 160 credits in any academic year. This regulation is intended to support students carrying forward modules and not to facilitate completion of studies in a shorter time than the usual minimum period of registration or to allow students to undertake additional optional modules in an academic session.</p>\n<p>b)   Pass modules rated to more than 50 credits and less than 80 credits – continue in registration as a part-time student but may not register for modules rated at more than 70 credits in the next year of study.</p>\n<p>c)   Pass modules rated at 50 credits or less – required to discontinue registration.</p>\n<p>17.7     A part-time student allowed to continue in registration, wishing to transfer to full-time study, will have her or his application considered by the programme’s admission tutor. Transfer is not at the student’s discretion.</p>\n<p>17.8   The only decisions available to the Board of Examiners on progress and award shall be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue – passed all assessments</li>\n<li>Required to be reassessed in the failed module(s) before continuing</li>\n<li>Continue – but required to be reassessed in the failed/deferred module(s) in next academic year</li>\n<li>Offered opportunity to repeat the entire level in next academic year before continuing</li>\n<li>Offered opportunity to be reassessed in next academic year as a part-time student before continuing</li>\n<li>Continue in part time registration (applies to part-time students only)</li>\n<li>No reassessment allowed – required to withdraw from course</li>\n<li>Decision deferred – outstanding assessments as a first attempt</li>\n<li>Decision deferred – outstanding reassessments</li>\n<li>Progress to placement</li>\n<li>Recommendation to Senate for specific awards</li>\n</ul>\n<p>17.9.1   Undergraduate programmes of study are designed on four levels, normally corresponding with Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework levels 7, 8, 9 and 10, with conceptual and material progression being designed into the structure from level to level. Thus, it is expected that students will progress from level to level, and the structure of the programme and the timetables are developed accordingly. Although the above regulations may allow a full-time student to stay in full-time registration albeit without a completed level of study, it may not be possible to construct a programme around the timetable available which is academically coherent and which makes best advantage of the student’s time. In most cases students will be expected and advised but not required to complete a level of study before progressing to the next level.</p>\n<p>17.9.2   Full-time undergraduate students may not normally proceed to level four study unless they   are eligible for the award of an Ordinary Degree. Exceptionally, a student may be able to progress to level four study when falling short by only 20 credit points.</p>\n<p>17.10   A student may cease to be registered for a postgraduate award if they:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>fail to register on any module in two successive semesters without prior approval (unless enrolled on a dissertation)</li>\n<li>are granted the award of PgCert, PgDip, MSc, MA, MBA, Executive Masters or MFA</li>\n<li>fail to have the dissertation proposal approved after two submissions</li>\n<li>accumulate fails as specified in regulations 17.12 and 17.13</li>\n<li>fail the dissertation on two attempts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>17.11   A postgraduate student will normally be permitted a reassessment attempt in up to two thirds of the taught modules on a programme. Should a student be unsuccessful at attempt two, they may be permitted a further reassessment attempt in a maximum of one third of the taught modules on a programme. Should a student breach these reassessment thresholds, they will be required to withdraw from the programme. A maximum of two attempts will be permitted for the Masters project/dissertation.</p>\n<p>17.12   Individual postgraduate programmes with a non-standard structure may define programme specific regulations under which a student may be required to withdraw. These regulations should be broadly in line with the above principle. Programme specific regulations defined to meet the requirements of Professional Statutory and Regulatory Bodies should be approved by the validation panel, or through the relevant committee.</p>\n<p><em style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">NB MSc/PgDip Occupational Therapy (Pre-Registration) students - see <a href=\"/%7BlocalLink:umb://document/67a539703f67425ea61090fdff30cc93%7D\" title=\"AR7 Programme exceptions\">Programme Exceptions</a></em></p>"

They should be late enough to allow the students time to prepare themselves, and to avoid overload of assessment shall normally take place in the summer/autumn. Students cannot request an extraordinary exam sitting. Third attempt assessments may be required to be undertaken in the following academic year. For students required to undertake a third attempt of an assessment, attendance at the module is optional (unless otherwise specified by the Board of Examiners).</p>\n<p>18.7     A student who is reassessed for a module failure in an undergraduate module, where there are no clear extenuating circumstances, shall be awarded no more than 40% on passing the reassessment.

To pass an undergraduate module at reassessment, a student must achieve at least 30% in each reassessed component and a weighted average of at least 40%. To pass a postgraduate module at reassessment, a student must achieve at least 40% in each reassessed component and a weighted average of at least 50%.</p>\n<p>18.9     A student who has been absent from an assessment, or who has performed badly due to illness or other cause, shall be allowed to take the assessment, and it shall be treated as a first assessment, subject to the reason for absence or poor performance being acceptable to the Board of Examiners or the Extenuating Circumstances Panel.</p>"
