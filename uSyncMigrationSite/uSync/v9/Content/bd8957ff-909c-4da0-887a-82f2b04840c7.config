      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Franchised programmes</strong></p>
<p>If your module is a copy of a module which also runs at QMU, you cannot change it on your own. You will need to talk to your Collaborative Academic Lead and the module co-ordinator at QMU. If they agree that your proposed change is a good idea they can take it to the appropriate committees. All versions of the module, wherever they are run in the world, should be the same.</p>
<p>Some franchised programmes run individual modules which are approved only for that partner. In this case, you can change the module, but you must follow the process for validated programmes below.</p>
<p><strong>Validated programmes</strong></p>
<p>If your programme was designed specifically for your organisation, the modules will not be direct copies of existing QMU modules. Your module descriptors are approved as part of the validation event. The panel will have checked them to make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The content is appropriate for the programme</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The learning outcomes are at the right academic level</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The balance of teaching approaches is appropriate</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The assessment is a valid measure of whether the students have met the learning outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>Care must be taken when changing a module to make sure that all the above statements remain true. It is also important to consider the effect of the change in the context of the programme as a whole. For instance, you might want to change your assessment to a multiple choice exam. But if all the other modules have a multiple choice exam, adding another will disturb the balance of assessments across the year.</p>
<p>It is also essential that students know what to expect. You can only change a module <strong>before</strong> students have started classes, and only if students have been consulted on the changes in advance.</p>
<p>Because of this, module co-ordinators are not allowed to change a module without checking with colleagues and (usually) seeking formal committee approval.</p>]]></Value>

Make sure you discuss the proposals with students as well.</li>\n<li>\n<p>For modules that are overseen by the external examiner (usually Level 3 and 4 of a four-year degree, all Masters level modules), check what they think of the proposed change.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Ask for approval from the Joint Board of Studies. This meeting brings together staff from the partner and QMU to take an overview of the partnership as a whole. Present the proposed change along with the evidence of feedback from the programme committee, students and the external examiner. If the Joint Board of Studies is happy with the change, it can be formally submitted to the School Academic Board.</li>\n<li>Forward the paperwork to the School Academic Board.

<p>Making changes to modules, even small adjustments, can have wider implications that you may not expect. For this reason, module co-ordinators may not make changes without consultation. In particular, no change may be made without informing and consulting the Collaborative Academic Lead.</p>]]></Value>
