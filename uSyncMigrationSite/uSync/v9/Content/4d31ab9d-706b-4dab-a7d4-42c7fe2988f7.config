      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">Rebecca McGeorge – Public Sociology – Level 2</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">Venice, Italy</span></p>
<p>I’ve spent ages contemplating and trying to pin point the highlight of my trip but, as we learned from Stefano and Marta, it’s never quite as simple as this as there are many contributing factors. For me it was the inspiring lectures, being surrounded by like-minded people, the amazing food, breath taking architecture, stunning galleries and museums, the culture, the overwhelming history of the city and the university alike, and of course the gelato. All of these aspects, for me, are what made the whole trip one that I will find very hard to forget.</p>
<p>Having the privilege of being taught by lecturers that are so passionate and engaged in their fields was a pleasure, and has really broadened my sociological views. Being able to look at social policy and sociology from an entirely different perspective is what I believe to be an integral part of sociology itself, and something that I know will have a positive effect on my studies. Having been given the chance to study abroad – even if just for a week – I now understand what an indispensable experience this is and the ongoing impact this will have on the rest of my studies – and life. But the experience hasn’t ended for me, it will continue as I return to my third year at Queen Margaret and see how it shapes my work going forward – and how I can use my experience to influence others.</p>
<p>The prospect of this being something that is more readily available for those of us who otherwise would not get to have this experience due to a lack of funding and circumstance is very exciting. I am proud to have been given the chance to take part in such a trip and cannot stress enough the value of the nature of this experience.</p>]]></Value>
