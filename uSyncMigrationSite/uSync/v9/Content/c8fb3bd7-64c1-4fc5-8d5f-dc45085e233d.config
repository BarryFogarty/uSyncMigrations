      <Value><![CDATA[<p>We involve our team of student ambassadors in delivery of a number of our activities.</p>
<p>The focus of our work with secondary schools is on schools with:</p>
<ul>
<li>pupils who have little or no family experience of higher education, or</li>
<li>traditionally low levels of progression to higher education</li>
<li>pupils who have been in care, or are young carers themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>Our team works closely with the Lothian Equal Access Programme for Schools<a href="http://www.leapsonline.org/"> (LEAPS)</a> programme and the <a href="https://www.leapsonline.org/about/our-schools">Schools for Higher Education Programme (SHEP)</a> and our activities are targeted to these schools (see the LEAPS website for the list of schools). If you are a teacher at another school outwith these groups, please contact our <a href="mailto:studentrecruitment@qmu.ac.uk">Education Liaison Officer</a> within the Recruitment Team who will be happy to help.</p>]]></Value>
