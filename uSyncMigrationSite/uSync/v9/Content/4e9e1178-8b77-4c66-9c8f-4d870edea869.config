      <Value><![CDATA[<p>13.2  A Short Programme is defined as a module, or group of modules, that may be taken separately without leading towards an award of the University. Short Programmes typically comprise one or more modules at SCQF level seven or above, usually up to a maximum of 60 credits. Although in some cases credit from short programmes may be used towards another QMU award, these programmes normally stand outside validated programmes and are taken by students as a self-contained package of learning for their own personal or professional development.</p>
<p>13.3  The procedures for approval and review of Short Programmes are set out under <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/38545d522d424a68b5f4d2f72babe861}" title="Non-standard events">Programme development, monitoring and review</a>, section 11. A validation event is not normally required for a Short Programme, although exceptions may apply (for details contact Governance and Quality Enhancement). Instead, the School Academic Board will consider the programme documentation and make a recommendation to Senate.</p>
<p>13.4  No new collaborative short programme may be approved unless a full costing has been carried out and the Dean has approved the price. A risk assessment must also be conducted by the Collaborative Academic Lead, in consultation with staff from Governance and Quality Enhancement. A Memorandum of Agreement will be required.</p>
<p>13.5   Short programme proposals with new partners must be considered by the Academic Planning Board, as for full collaborative programmes and Local Support Centres. The Academic Planning Board approves the partner. The full documentation is then submitted to the School Academic Board (SAB) for approval of the programme and module descriptor(s). Proposals for new short programmes with existing partners may be submitted straight to SAB. The Short Programme approval form, costing information and a risk assessment will accompany the documentation.</p>
<p>13.6   Each collaborative Short Programme will report to a relevant University Programme Committee, of which a representative of the collaborative partner will be a member. Through the University Programme Committee, the Short Programme team will in turn report to the relevant School Academic Board. (In some cases, the Short Programme may have its own Joint Board of Studies.) The collaborative Short Programme leader’s annual report will be reported to and discussed by the relevant University Programme Committee and thereafter reported to the relevant School Academic Board.</p>
<p>13.7   Academic results from collaborative Short Programmes will be considered by the appropriate University Board of Examiners, of which representatives from the collaborative partner will be members.</p>
