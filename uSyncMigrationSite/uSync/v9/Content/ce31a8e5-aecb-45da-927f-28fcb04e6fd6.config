Falls can result in distress, pain, injury, loss of confidence, loss of independence and mortality(2). The annual cost of falls spend by the NHS has been estimated over £2.3 billion(2) and is expected to rise with an ageing population(3). Strategies to reduce falls and enhance older peoples falls-efficacy are therefore necessary. </p>\n<p>The Balance Recovery Confidence (BRC) scale is a novel instrument developed by our research team(4). The BRC scale is a distinctive patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that assesses balance recovery confidence across various perturbation-type scenarios. The scale has excellent psychometric properties and has shown greater congruence to reactive postural control than other PROMs for balance confidence, fear of falling and perceived functional ability. The initial evaluation of its psychometric properties revealed that the instrument is well accepted by the community-dwelling older adults in Singapore. The scale was shown to be unidimensional with good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Correlations with other PROMs (ABC, FES-I, LLFDI-F and Mini BESTest) were moderate suggesting that the BRC can offer additional information which can support our understanding of the management of falls in older people. The BRC scale has the potential to benefit clinicians’ measurement of falls in order to individualise falls rehabilitation however further work is required to explore the generalisability of the BRC scale to a UK population. Further psychometric properties, e.g., responsiveness, minimal important difference (MID), also require evaluation. More studies on BRCs scale measurement properties would improve confidence among researchers and clinicians on the scale’s utility.</p>\n<p>The work is novel, with potential for wide clinical impact. The scale would be useful for those wishing to assess perceived reactive balance recovery control. Further studies to assess responsiveness and minimal important difference are needed to provide further evidence of the clinical utility of the scale and to extend the impact of the existing work.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of the research questions of proposed studentship:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A cross-cultural validation of the Balance Recovery Confidence (BRC) Scale for the United Kingdom</li>\n<li>What are the psychometric properties of the BRC scale – UK version?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For enquiries and further information please contact: </strong>Dr Judith Lane (jlane@qmu.ac.uk)</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls\" title=\"Falls - World Health Organisation\">WHO.

It was developed in England in 2014 and is nowplayed in countries worldwide as a participation programme with hopes that it will one day become an internationally competitive sport. The International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football (IFCPF) is working in partnership with the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CPISRA) to further explore and develop this new format of football.</p>\n<p>Although there are several similarities with RaceRunning, for example regarding the high support athletes participating in these sports, there are also a few important differences. One them is the fact that the majority of Frame Football players are under 16. Although a decline in physical activity participation is also observed in early teens in the general population (e.g [1]), CP specific factors such as pain and fatigue [2] may also play an important role in this decline [3].

Frame Running athletes propel themselves using a Frame Running frame which has three wheels, a saddle, breast plate for support and handlebars. Athletes propel themselves with their legs using a variety of propulsion techniques. Frame Running specifically caters for athletes who cannot walk or have severe difficulty walking. Classification in para sports allocates athletes to sport classes based on their impairment and according to the IPC (International Paralympic Committee) should ’minimise the impact of eligible impairments on the outcome of competition’ [1]. Since 2007 classification systems are required to be based on scientific evidence. Recent research has provided this evidence for a Frame Running classification [2,3]. However, it is important that further data continues to be collected to further strengthen the evidence base for Frame Running classification. Further, classification research with regard to Frame Running may also be relevant for other sports in which athletes with a coordination impairment compete.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of the research questions of this studentship include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do Dyskinesia and Ataxia impact Frame Running performance?</li>\n<li>What is the test–retest reliability of the measures in the proposed evidence-based classification system in the Frame Running athlete population?</li>\n<li>Which measures (if any) in the new evidence-based classification system may be susceptible to Intentional Misrepresentation [4] and how can this be detected?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For enquiries and further information please contact: </strong>Dr Marietta van der Linden (mvanderlinden@qmu.ac.uk)</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tweedy SM, Vanlandewijck YC (2011).

    "content": "<p><strong>BUR 22-04</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Working title: Injury risk in competitive youth cyclists</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Cycling is a popular activity for many young people. Cycle racing is flourishing at the youth level with thousands regularly participating [1]. Although cycling is commonly thought to be a low impact sport, and therefore a lower risk for non-traumatic injury, relatively static postures combined with a repeated cycling action in addition to the higher volume of training associated with racing may potentially place the youth racer at increased risk of injury. Knee and back pain are the most commonly reported injuries in the cycling population [2].</p>\n<p>Across the wider adolescent population, knee pain is a commonly reported condition. Although knee pain in adolescents is thought by many to be a self-limiting condition, studies have shown that as many as one in two adolescents will still report pain one year later and four out of ten still report significant knee pain five years later [3]. Chronic knee pain has a significant impact on quality of life and 60% of young people had either stopped or reduced their sporting activity as a result of their knee pain. A greater understanding of factors that contribute to the development of knee pain would therefore be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Several studies have explored injury risk in young athletes although there is a lack of consistent guidance. Jaythani et al [4] reported that higher levels of sport specialization were associated with increased injuries. Studies of elite adolescent athletes have however suggested that injury risk is multifactorial and that factors such as nutritional status and sleep are significant [5].</p>\n<p>Although the prevalence of knee pain in the general adolescent population has been fairly well documented, few studies have considered the effect of type or level of sporting activity on the risk for developing knee pain. Murray [6] notes the large degree of variability in typical training loads across different sports and suggests that there may be a link between type of sport and injury risk. In addition, sports specific elements such as age of specialization, the environment, equipment and sporting rules may have a role to play [5].

There is now compelling evidence of ongoing physical, cognitive and psychological problems after critical illness that are frequently not addressed through current care provision [1, 2].</p>\n<p>Physical problems may contribute to a prolonged recovery time and for many, exercising and participating in a structured exercise programme is challenging. There is a lack of a co-ordinated rehabilitation pathway and survivors’ needs are often neither identified nor specifically addressed [3]. There is still uncertainty about the most effective way to deliver physical rehabilitation after critical illness and in particular after discharge home [4, 5]. Discharge home is becoming increasingly ‘quicker’ and targeted at those who are ‘sicker’ shifting both the burden and complexity of care delivery to community services. As a result, the development and evaluation of community-based rehabilitation is increasingly important.</p>\n<p>Qualitative evaluation of an exercise programme delivered immediately after discharge from hospital highlighted the importance placed on exercise by survivors of critical illness but identified barriers to the intervention, that had been designed by health professionals, including poor mental health, physical limitations and lack of motivation [6]. Our own work has highlighted that recovery following critical illness happens within an individual's time-frame, not a schedule imposed by the healthcare system, and rehabilitation and exercise interventions need to be responsive to this [3].</p>\n<p>This study will employ a mixed methods approach to firstly identify rehabilitation needs of survivors of critical illness after discharge from hospital and explore potential models for the delivery of exercise rehabilitation. Secondly, this data will be used to develop and pilot the feasibility of a community-based model of rehabilitation and exercise delivery after critical illness. It is anticipated engagement with survivors of critical illness will ensure the intervention is responsive to their needs and inform a community-based model of rehabilitation which promotes self and long-term management.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of the research projects include:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>To explore the rehabilitation needs and potential models of community-based exercise rehabilitation with survivors of critical illness.</li>\n<li>To develop a community-based exercise rehabilitation intervention with survivors of critical illness.</li>\n<li>To pilot and explore the feasibility of a developed community-based exercise rehabilitation intervention for survivors of critical illness.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>For enquiries and further information please contact:</strong> Dr Lisa Salisbury (Lsalisbury@qmu.ac.uk)</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Needham DM, Davidson J, Cohen H, Hopkins RO, Weinert C, Wunsch H, et al.

Physiotherapists help people living with stroke to exercise and practice movements with the aim of relearning of functional tasks affected by their stroke [2]. There are numerous approaches to stroke rehabilitation, however no definitive optimal approach has been identified [3].</p>\n<p>There is however, emerging evidence to suggest that specific training during stroke rehabilitation based on Motor Learning (ML) principles may drive neuroplasticity and reduce post-stroke motor impairments [4]. Knowledge and understanding of motor learning (ML) principles is fundamental to physiotherapy and has numerous applications in physiotherapy practice [5]. Key aspects of ML such as task specificity, structuring practice and providing feedback are important elements in clinical practice [6] and empirical evidence from clinical studies provide some insight about how to apply ML principles such as intensity of practice, structure of practice schedules and how to provide feedback in clinical practice [4,5]. Most of these studies have explored single components of ML principles and only a limited number of studies have investigated the efficacy of ML principles in stroke rehabilitation [7]. There is therefore a gap between the integration of ML theory, research and clinical practice in stroke rehabilitation [4,5].</p>\n<p>This studentship will explore the topic of motor (re)learning in stroke rehabilitation potentially using a mixed methods approach. This might include a systematic literature review and an initial observational study, followed by a qualitative exploration of physiotherapists’ knowledge and perceptions.

This accommodates up to 60 people from one-third of the council areas in Scotland [1]. Significant service redesign is underway, including development of a new nearby site, to replace the current campus. CS wish to be sector-leading, engaging actively in research and knowledge exchange to optimise the outcomes of their provision for health and wellbeing of their community. Over the summer 2021 they commissioned QMU to develop research insights into current and optimal service provision, informed by literature and the views of customers and other stakeholders. This project has been completed and work is underway to disseminate the research insights. The findings informed the CS Business Plan for the new site (Bertha Park) and both organisations wish to progress the collaboration relating to research and practice.</p>\n<p>A scoping review was conducted, focusing on environmental factors that influence participation for people with disabilities living in residential settings.

Co-production can be inhibited where people are unable to talk to the designers.</p>\n<p>Active support is needed within appropriate physical spaces that uses assistive and smart technologies to enable residents’ expression and development [3,4]. This needs support, infrastructure and training and can enhance independence, physical activity, social integration and productivity [5,6].

Specifically, rapidly increasing volumes of high intensity actions such as high-speed running, sprinting, and explosive changes of direction, may leave players especially vulnerable (1). Similarly, arduous training sessions and match-play have been shown to elicit reduced neuromuscular (NM) performance for up to 72 hours subsequently<br />highlighting the potential for critical disruption to homeostasis among soccer players (2).</p>\n<p>The implementation of tracking devices, such as global positioning systems (GPS), has facilitated a more accurate characterisation of the locomotor activities of elite male players to inform training practices. This has resulted in an optimisation of performance with some minimisation of injuries (3). However, despite this increased evidence for the elite male footballer there remains is a relative scarcity of research evidence that characterises the locomotor activities and training load of the elite woman footballer in general (4,5) and the elite Scottish female professional footballer in particular.</p>\n<p>The proposed PhD will offer a novel, soccer-specific appraisal of meaningful, contemporary research questions whose findings might have direct applicability to enhanced practices within training to ensure increased likelihood of improved performance and the prevention of injury elite Scottish female football players. The programme of research will be designed to be feasible and compatible with current elite club practices of a Scottish professional senior ladies team and be<br />minimally-intrusive to the playing and support staff.</p>\n<p>Focus will be placed on the senior professionals and their potential for performance development, but will also involve selective evaluations of junior (under-20) and academy players to facilitate ‘baseline’ evaluations of performance and fitness capacities. This would facilitate comprehensive limb and muscle group comparisons, ‘individualised’ post-injury rehabilitative care and objective markers for safe, postinjury return to playing. The culmination of the research would focus on the development and evaluation of the effectiveness of a practically-relevant and novel ‘acute’ high-intensity fatiguing intervention that would be designed to (i) enhance soccer performance capabilities by minimising fatigability and to lessen the likelihood of musculoskeletal injury in elite female football players and (ii) minimise the likelihood of physiological incompatibility (interference) amongst stimuli for high-intensity and muscular endurance conditioning.</p>\n<p>Duration of conditioning would be tailored to the<br />time-availability constraints within the women’s professional football club for pre-season/intraseason preventative conditioning and, where appropriate, physiotherapeutic rehabilitation. This programme of PhD research proposes to investigate changes in elite female football players’ fatigability, neuromuscular, and sensori-motor performance across a playing season, in the context of player load and injury data, to inform the practices of the club’s Strength &amp; Conditioning and Medical departments.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential exemplar studies:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Study 1:</em> A comparison of agility-related functional capacity and neuromuscular performance capabilities in senior and early-career female professional soccer players across the competitive season.</p>\n<p><em>Study 2:</em> An exploration of the effects of the training load associated with the match-play microcycle upon agility-related functional capacity, neuromuscular performance capabilities, and game-related fatigability in elite female footballers.</p>\n<p><em>Study 3:</em> The effects of an acute intra-season neuromuscular and sensorimotor performance conditioning programme on agility-related functional capacity, neuromuscular performance capabilities and resistance to game-related fatigue in female professional soccer players.</p>\n<p><strong>Supervisory Team: </strong>Professor Tom Mercer (tmercer@qmu.ac.uk), Professor Nigel Gleeson (ngleeson@qmu.ac.uk), Nathan Ring.</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bowen, L., Gross, A.

There is a lack of current evidence to support effective management of Morton’s neuroma although steroid injection is currently the gold standard and supported by higher level evidence with a few randomised control studies although long-term evidence is lacking [1–3].</p>\n<p>Orthotics and footwear advice is also used routinely although the evidence is poor. When these conservative options fail the only pathway available is surgical neurectomy although complications and pain may persist post-surgery. With COVID-19 orthopaedic surgical waiting times have increased considerably and as such a presurgical option involving chemical ablation of the neuroma would have a positive impact not only on waiting times but also offer patients an alternative to surgery. Unlike other conservative treatments, alcohol injections aim to relieve pain by destroying the nerve. It offers potentially an alternative approach and rather than remove the nerve surgically destroying the nerve non-invasively. It will also offer faster recovery times when compared to surgery and its associated risks.</p>\n<p>Although alcohol injection for ablation of Morton’s neuroma may offer a suitable alternative unfortunately a systematic review suggested that more evidence is required due to poor quality studies [4]. The gaps in the literature identified suggests that a multicentre randomised control trial is not possible at present, and a feasibility study is required to facilitate the design of such study. This novel feasibility study has potential impact to contribute to a cost-effective potential gold standard of a new surgical alternative treatment with improvements in quality of life and impact on reducing surgical waiting times.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of the research questions for the proposed PhD studentship:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the most effective alcohol concentration and technique for injection?</li>\n<li>What is the number of injections required?</li>\n<li>What is the optimum local anaesthetic and dosage regime?</li>\n<li>How many participants are required for a multi-centre randomised control trial?</li>\n<li>Are there any side effects?</li>\n<li>What control arm to use eg no treatment [on surgical waiting list] and/or surgical neurectomy?</li>\n<li>What effective short- and long-term outcome tools to use for future RCT?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For further enquiries please contact: </strong>Professor Derek Santos (dsantos@qmu.ac.uk)</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Edwards RT, Yeo ST, Russell D, et al.
