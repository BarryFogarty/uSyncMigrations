      <Value><![CDATA[<p>We offer full-time (three years) and part-time (six years) doctoral training programmes (including PhDs and a Professional Doctorate) in topics or research approaches in which QMU researchers have expertise. You will create a significant piece of original research and, in the process, gain advanced research skills, putting you in a very strong position for progression in your chosen academic or professional field. Our programmes also include an award of a Doctoral Certificate, achieved by completing three READ modules (Researcher Enhancement and Development) each of 20 credits at SCQF level 12.</p>
<p>Your doctorate is a substantial piece of learning and research, reflecting three or more years of endeavour, which has commercial, cultural or social value. It is also a process through which you will acquire advanced research knowledge, skills and expertise, be challenged and transform as a person. The training programme for your doctorate will require significant personal discipline, time and commitment. In return, your sense of achievement at the end will be immense, and successful completion of your doctorate will open up a range of opportunities for career advancement.</p>]]></Value>

Our Academic Schools also have a dedicated Postgraduate School Research Coordinator, who is available for independent consultation and support.</li>\n<li>During the course of the PhD programme, there will be many opportunities for professional and personal development. Students receive a wide range of generic research skills training which is organised by the Centre for Academic Practice and delivered during dedicated doctoral study weeks throughout each academic year. Engagement with research skills training and professional development opportunities enables face-to-face interaction amongst the doctoral community, which in turn facilitates collaborative enquiry, shared learning, individual exploration and mutual support and challenge.</li>\n<li>In addition to the 540 doctoral credits gained by successful completion of the PhD, students are also enrolled on the Doctoral Certificate in Researcher Enhancement and Development (READ). Successful completion of the READ programme awards students an additional 60, level 12, doctoral credits in research skills.</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p>Enrolling on a doctoral degree is one of the biggest decisions you can make regarding your education and learning in your career. We want your doctoral programme experience to be based around feeling part of a thriving learning community. The importance and power of peer support cannot be underestimated during doctoral-level study, so engaging with the community of doctoral candidates, supervisors and academics that exists at QMU is a core element in your programme. It is the community of learning that grounds you and your study and gives you the strength to stay engaged and curious, and to design and craft your thesis and publications. Your thesis will be an original, deeply researched piece of work that is of significant interest to you. However, your doctorate at QMU will be about much more than picking a subject and getting on with your studies.</p>\n<p>QMU’s Graduate School offers research supervision by academics with an international track record and connections to other international researchers working in their field. All doctoral candidates are hosted by a <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/d642254ee853449cbabd2bfe5c4c98e8}\" title=\"Research and Knowledge Exchange\">Research Centre or an Institute</a>. We also host a Doctoral Candidates’ Association and the various Research Centres or Institutes offer significant peer support and learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>QMU is a member of the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science (SGSSS) and the Scottish Graduate School of Arts and Humanities (SGSAH). These memberships allow QMU doctoral candidates to access a large range of additional doctoral training and development opportunities, such as advanced skills training, internships, local conferences and summer schools. </p>"

The doctorate is ultimately assessed by the thesis or creative work and viva examination. The usual PhD thesis length is 70,000 to 100,000 words. Where PhD research involves creative writing, a portfolio of creative work or the preparation of a scholarly edition, the critical commentary on the material under discussion would normally be within the range of 30,000 to 40,000 words. The usual Professional Doctorate thesis length is 45,000 words.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>PhD candidate submissions</strong></span></p>\n<p>Candidates take part in three assessment exercises to confirm progress towards the submission of the final thesis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The probationary assessment, in Year One (for both full-time and part-time candidates), comprises the submission of a comprehensive research proposal (approx. 6,000 words) that is followed by a viva with an internal assessment panel composed of two research supervisors unconnected with the topic or candidate.</li>\n<li>The assessed seminar in Year Two (Year Four for part-time candidates) generally takes the form of a 3,000 word paper or thesis chapter, or creative piece, which sets out the progression of study to date and outlines how the candidate plans to progress their research to completion within the timeline.</li>\n<li>The assessed seminar in year three (year five to six for part-time candidates) takes place prior to the submission of the final thesis or creative work.
