You will thrive in our supportive environment, and benefit from placements each year along with practical experience in our specialist clinical facilities on campus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>You will learn in face-to-face and online lectures, seminars, tutorials and practical workshops. There will be a mix of classroom and online learning. Outwith timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue your own learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of assessment methods (for example written and practical exams, written assignments, presentations) at the end of each module.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>Placements are invaluable in consolidating theoretical study into practical expertise by working directly with patients and qualified staff. You will complete practice placements in each year. You will attend a variety of placements within the NHS at various locations across Scotland. QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employability placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist facilities</strong></p>\n<p>QMU offers a variety of modern spaces for use by Master of Podiatry (MPod)/BSc (Hons) Podiatry and <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/e6f45f8c0e7a4303957bc11f46db3d63}\" title=\"MSc Podiatry (Pre-Registration)\">MSc Podiatry (Pre-Registration)</a> courses. We have a large multipurpose clinical room, a large orthotics lab with a separate machine room, and a fully functioning surgical suite which are all used to facilitate student learning and our on-campus patient facing clinics. On-campus staff-supported clinics which we operate within the aforementioned spaces include: Nail surgery clinics, Nail surgery assessment and dressings clinics, and Musculoskeletal/Biomechanics clinics. We also provide simulated learning experiences within our clinical spaces to enable students to safely develop complex skills which can then be transferred into the practice education/clinical setting with patients. In addition, students will have access to additional laboratory based environments for specific teaching for Microbiology and Physiology, thus enabling us to contextualise complex theory into practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">This four-year undergraduate Master of Podiatry (MPod)/BSc (Hons) Podiatry course will provide you with the theoretical understanding and practical skills that you will need to build your flexible and rewarding career as a podiatrist in the NHS or private sector. You will learn advanced practical skills on placement to allow you to develop your podiatric skills as you progress through the course. </span></p>
<p>QMU offers two undergraduate pathways of study in Podiatry to achieve a recognised qualification. Initially all students register on the undergraduate master’s pathway and study together, then, from the end of the second year, students on the BSc (Hons) pathway follow a slightly different programme of study to those studying for the undergraduate master’s degree. On graduation, both pathways offer eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a Podiatrist.</p>
<p>Please see the course structure on this page for more information on the <a href="/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/">benefits of pursuing the undergraduate master’s route rather than the BSc.</a></p>]]></Value>
