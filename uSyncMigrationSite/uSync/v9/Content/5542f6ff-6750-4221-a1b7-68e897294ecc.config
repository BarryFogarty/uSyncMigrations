Combining psychology’s focus on the individual with sociology’s focus on the social, the course provides you with valuable interdisciplinary insight into topics, issues and debates surrounding human behaviour and society. Our interdisciplinary approach encourages you to connect the dots between psychological phenomena and sociological patterns, fostering a holistic understanding of the human experience.</p>\n<p>You will also engage with debates about the practical, theoretical and ethical issues in relation to conducting research and analysing data from the perspective of both disciplines, as well as explore how research can be used to better understand and find solutions to address social issues relevant to different communities and social groups.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course, you will develop a range of transferable skills that employers are looking for, including critical analysis, communication skills and research skills. Our graduates have gone into a wide variety of fields, including business, health, media, education, social care and management.</p>\n<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>reflect upon the ways in which psychological and sociological knowledge can affect real change in people’s everyday lives;</li>\n<li>learn to use social scientific methods and evidence to make sense of human behaviour;</li>\n<li>learn how to think and write critically, giving you skills that can be valuable in many professional fields; and</li>\n<li>have opportunities to go into communities and apply your skills and knowledge in a real-world context.</li>\n</ul>"
