<p>What is considered a Protected Adult? An individual aged 16 or over who is provided with particular services further defined at section 94 of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007. An important principle underpinning PVG is that a person is a protected adult by virtue of a service they receive, not because of a particular condition or disability, and that they are a protected adult only while receiving that service. In that sense, all of us may at one time or another be a protected adult: for example, when receiving medical treatment.</p>

<p>If a researcher is unsure on the required level of disclosure or whether they are required to be registered on the PVG scheme, they should contact the <a href="mailto:researchethics@qmu.ac.uk" title="QMU Research Ethics Panel Email Address">University Research Ethics Panel Email</a> in the first instance for advice.</p>

<p>This document is to help researchers making an application to Research Ethics Committees determine the required level of disclosure and whether they are required to be registered on the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) scheme for their research work.</p>
<p>The PVG Scheme is Scotland's response to the principal recommendation of the Bichard Inquiry Report which was undertaken following the tragic murders in Soham in 2002. This recommendation called for a registration system for all those who work - whether paid or unpaid - with children and protected adults in the UK that would confirm that there is no known reason why an individual should not work with these groups. This is achieved by Disclosure Scotland maintaining a list of people who are barred from working with children and a list of people who are barred from working with protected adults. The PVG Scheme was established by the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>
