    "content": "<p>I have worked as a diagnostic radiographer since qualifying from Sheffield Hallam University in 1998. My first professional posts were at the Chesterfield Royal Hospital and the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield where I focused on conventional radiography. I decided to change my career direction towards cross sectional imaging and therefore moved to Alliance Medical in 2002. It was in this post that I gained my initial grounding in MRI and CT.</p>\n<p>I then decided to take a career break and travelled the world for 2 years. During this time I worked in Australia as a radiographer to keep my hand in and fund my trip.</p>\n<p>On returning to the UK I began working for the BUPA Hospital in Bristol as an MRI radiographer. During this time I did further postgraduate study in MRI at Sheffield Hallam University and gained a promotion to the MRI Manager. I then became involved in the procurement of the new MRI and CT scanners, the installation of PACS and IEP and the setting up of the new SPIRE Specialist Care Centre. At this point I was promoted to imaging manager.</p>\n<p>I moved to QMU in 2014 where my undergraduate teaching has focused on cross sectional anatomy, MRI and CT. I have been involved in the development of a number of postgraduate modules for both the diagnostic radiography and radiotherapy programmes as well as postgraduate pre-registration modules. I have been particularly interested in the development of CT and MRI postgraduate programmes with a particular emphasis on CT and MRI radiographer reporting. </p>\n<p><strong>Affiliations/Memberships to Other Organisations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HCPC and SCoR</li>\n</ul>"
