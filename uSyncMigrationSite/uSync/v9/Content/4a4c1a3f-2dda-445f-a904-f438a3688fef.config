      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Queen Margaret University’s unique Costume Design &amp; Construction (CDC) course – Scotland’s only degree focusing equally on the design and construction of costumes and where students learn by working on real shows – has built a reputation for both creative and craft excellence over many years. This year, 40 students from across all four years of the BA (Hons) Costume Design and Construction will showcase their work at the end of year catwalk event, with costumes modelled by students from across QMU’s performing arts departments.</p>
<p>Sarah Paulley, Lecturer in Costume Design, discussed the 2019 show. She said: “This is a fantastically exciting and varied show which features creative talent from every year group.</p>
<p>“This year, the show will involve an assortment of historical characters including Charles II, Joan of Arc and Marie Antoinette, with collections inspired by the romantic medieval ‘Belle Dame Sans Mercie’, Charles Edward Worth, and futuristic 1920s cubist ballet. There will be suits of armour, towering wigs, a collection of corsets and a scary Jabberwocky.”</p>
<p>To complement the enchanting St Cecilia’s Hall, the show features a specially commissioned collection of characters from Lewis Carroll’s dream like fantasies ‘Alice in Wonderland’ and ‘Alice Through the Looking-glass’. The Mad Hatter, the Red and White Queens, and Alice herself will be joining them for a whimsical tea party.</p>
<p>This joyous event has been generously supported by the Honorary Costumier Awards Scheme, which allows organisations and individuals to support individual students by providing funds to buy the materials needed to create these dazzling costumes.</p>
<p>For the first time, our graduates will also be exhibiting their work in one of Scotland’s most prestigious venues. The Balmoral, a Rocco Forte Hotel in Edinburgh, has kindly offered to house the creative exhibition between the 6 and the 27 May. The hotel is keen to support emerging talent and to invite new guests into the hotel to view the exhibition. In a new collaboration, QMU and The Balmoral will also present this year’s promenade event showcasing Alice in Wonderland-inspired costumes as part of a themed Balmoral Afternoon Tea at the hotel’s iconic Palm Court on 27 May. The promenade promises to add yet more magic and theatre to the five star experience.</p>
<p>Sarah Paulley concluded: “We are very much looking forward to this year’s Costume Showcase, the exhibition and the promenade event. We are extremely grateful to all of our funders for their support of the students – without their generosity, this would not have been possible, and to The Balmoral for hosting our 2019 Graduate Exhibition.”</p>
