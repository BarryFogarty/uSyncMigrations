<ul>
<li><strong>We are smaller by design than many universities, so you will enjoy smaller class sizes and a close, supportive relationship with our academic team.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be part of a vibrant, supportive and social learning community.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will benefit from a carefully considered balance of theory and practical learning. Exciting placement opportunities will further develop your Sports Rehabilitation skills.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2022, we are ranked in the top 20 UK universities for subjects allied to medicine (19th out of 82). </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On completion of this course you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to apply for registration with BASRaT (British Association of Sports Rehabilitators and Therapists) and upon graduation practise as a Sports Rehabilitator.</li>
<li>Be able to confidently deliver safe, effective and person-centred sports rehabilitation care on graduation.</li>
<li>Become part of a community of learners, working collaboratively with lecturers, clinical staff, service users and other students on a transformational journey towards registration.</li>
<li>Carry out invaluable practice-based placements in each year that will enrich your learning. Placements will take place in a range of settings which could include private practice, NHS, third sector, sports clubs or sporting events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical activity is considered an essential component of a healthy lifestyle. The positive effects of physical activity on physical and mental wellbeing are well established. Sport and physical activity also, however, carry some inherent injury risk. Graduate Sports Rehabilitators (GSR) are musculoskeletal specialists who use skills and knowledge of exercise, movement and manual therapies in order to diagnose, prevent and rehabilitate musculoskeletal injuries.</p>
<p>This course will allow you to develop a broader understanding of the prevention and management of injury and disease in an exercise and physical activity context.</p>
<p>The course recognises that sport includes all forms of physical activity which may be either casual, organised, or at a professional, competitive level.  Activity is undertaken to improve physical fitness and mental wellbeing, to develop social relationships or to perform at a professional level and obtain results in competition.  Therefore you will work with a range of clients from professional sportspeople to those solely undertaking sport for personal and enjoyment reasons.  This could include special populations such as older adults, disabled people, people with a chronic disease and children.</p>
<p>The overarching aim for the BSc (Hons) Sports Rehabilitation is to produce graduates who are skilled, resilient, autonomous, collaborative, critical and reflective problem solvers, who can make a positive contribution to the health and wellbeing of individuals and of society.</p>
<p>This course enables you to convert an appropriate existing qualification into a degree and is equivalent to years three and four of an honours degree. You will complete a range of modules each year as outlined.</p>]]></Value>
