    "content": "<p><span class=\"lead\">Structure</span></p>\n<p>This is a four-year BSc (Hons) degree course. On completion students will be eligible to apply for registration with the NMC as a registered adult nurse. Over the four years you will complete a total of 4,600 hours of theory and practice experience that is split equally. The main difference from our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/60ff9b9378494a27a333bfd745bac4a4}\" title=\"Master of Nursing (MNurse)\">Master of Nursing</a>  is the credit level of the academic work, which will be higher in the master’s to allow for a higher level final qualification.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Teaching, learning and assessment</span></p>\n<p>Our aim in developing this course has been to use a range of creative ways of teaching and learning to promote self-development and the skills for interacting with others. You will be facilitated to learn in lectures, seminars, practical laboratories and have practice learning experiences. Outside of timetabled sessions, you will be expected to continue learning through self-study.</p>\n<p>We aim to include creative ways of assessment that may involve student choice. Assessments include practical and written exams, assignments and group work.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Placements (Practice Learning Experience)</span></p>\n<p>A Practice Learning Experience (PLE) is offered each year. PLEs provide the opportunity to integrate theory and practice by working directly with people in whichever setting they are.</p>\n<p>PLEs can be in a variety of settings such as the community area, a hospital or care home. These may be in the Lothians and Borders. Edinburgh Napier University manages the sourcing of PLEs for each student on this course. Lecturing staff at QMU manage the allocation of PLEs for each student.</p>\n<p>The teams are always looking at widening opportunities for students and we are increasing the variety of available PLEs all the time. Opportunities to work with specialist research nurses are being developed.</p>\n<p>To enhance future employablity PLEs take place across across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least some of their practice-based learning unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that mean they must remain in a specific location. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></span></p>\n<p>There are no specific exchange PLEs available within the course, however, we promote available opportunities to students and these may include exchanges for a limited number of students and also volunteering opportunities which can be done in the summer break. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></span></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
