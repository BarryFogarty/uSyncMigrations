Experience at cultural events is often emotional, linked to (re-)negotiation of identity and Bourdieusian ideas of status, habitus, and socio-cultural capital. Additionally, there are dynamics of power that are prevalent in such environments regarding event programming, participation, access, and inclusion. Therefore, different perspectives of experience influence memory.</p>\n<p>This research seeks to answer the question ‘Are people remembering the same things from events? And if not, why not?’ This refers to diverse experiences – how they are remembered and by whom. There is also scope to extend this research into the digital event landscape, comparing the relationship of memory and experience between physical places and online spaces and how dis/embodied realms have an effect on memories.</p>\n<p>Methodological approaches could employ mixed methods, as aligned with these subjects: quantitative methods for memory research and qualitative storytelling-centred research for experiential investigation. However, we are open to other options and look forward to hearing ideas for creative approaches.</p>\n<p>This research is novel, as it cross-pollinates from distinct disciplines; as such, it has the potential to make an impactful contribution to both fields. For example, it can help to inform event design and production by applying attendees’ memories of experiences to improve perceptions of safety, accessibility, and inclusivity. Also, it can contribute to understanding of individuals’ cognition regarding memory and perceptions of events, which sets itself apart from bodies of work that have been conducted on cultural or collective memory for specific experiences, and, thus, there is the exciting opportunity to advance knowledge, both applied and conceptual.</p>\n<p>What sorts of knowledge and skills are we looking for in an applicant?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Innovative ideas about how an understanding of memory can help to inform how we think about creating recollections of lived experiences.</li>\n<li>Basic research skills in qualitative and/or quantitative research and a willingness to learn and apply skills from both approaches.</li>\n<li>Interest in critical event studies and/or psychology and a willingness to learn more about how these disciplines can be combined in praxis.</li>\n<li>Dynamism and enthusiasm to drive these ideas forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your proposal should detail relevant interdisciplinary literature you might draw upon as well as outlining your proposed research design for the study outlined above.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Centre:</strong> Centre for Applied Social Sciences</p>\n<p><strong>Supervisory team:</strong> Dr Rebecca Finkel and Dr Stephen Darling</p>"

The current institutional Research and Knowledge Exchange (KE) Strategy makes specific reference to \"how we take action on local and global environmental challenges and promote more sustainable research and KE practices\". This project seeks to make such action relevant to communities most affected by environmental injustices. The UK is a signatory to the UN Aarhus Convention on Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. The Scottish Government will be consulting on the Human Rights (Scotland) Bill scheduled for 2022 which will include the human right to a healthy environment and has funded the <a href=\"https://www.ercs.scot/\" title=\"Environmental Rights Centre for Scotland\">Environmental Rights Centre for Scotland (ERCS)</a> Rights Worker through its Equality and Human Rights Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Methodology</strong></p>\n<p>This project would employ a participatory action research methodology, working with a community (or communities) facing locally unwanted land uses in Scotland, who are connected to the Environmental Rights Centre for Scotland (ERCS). It will seek to identify barriers to accessing justice on the environment and how they can be overcome, particularly for minority groups. The project would work alongside ERCS's Rights Worker 'to advance the human right to a healthy environment for equality groups through engagement, education and advice'. The research will be of practical use to the communities and will inform ERCS’s legal advocacy work to secure concrete progress on environmental rights in Scotland.</p>\n<p><strong>Training </strong></p>\n<p>This PhD project will equip the candidate with essential skills in public sociology including dialogical analysis, critical thinking and critical analysis, and problem-solving. As well as benefiting from the training provided by QMU’s graduate school and support from the Doctoral Candidates Association (DCA), the candidate will also develop skills in research and academic writing through participation and presentations in research seminars at QMU and at other academic conferences. Links to relevant community interest groups, ERCS and any other local rights groups, to provide outreach and engagement opportunities will be facilitated under the supervision of Dr Eurig Scandrett who has led environmental justice research at QMU for over 15 years and is a recognised authority in this field.</p>\n<p><strong>Person Specification</strong></p>\n<p>Applicants should have an excellent postgraduate degree in sociology/any relevant social sciences/humanities discipline <strong>OR</strong> a first degree in any social science/humanities discipline with some experience of working with communities. Applications should also exhibit a strong interest in public sociology/environmental justice.</p>\n<p>Your proposal should detail relevant literature you might draw upon as well as outlining your proposed research design for the study outlined above.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Centre:</strong> Centre for Applied Social Sciences</p>\n<p><strong>Supervisory team:</strong> Dr Eurig Scandrett and Dr Stanley Nwankpa</p>\n<p> </p>"
