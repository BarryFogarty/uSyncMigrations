      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The annual Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce Business Awards, which were held at the capital's Sheraton Grand Hotel on Monday 29th February, are firmly recognised as the Awards for the Edinburgh business community. Now in their 5th year, the Awards allow members to gain recognition and celebrate success. <br /><br />QMU beat off stiff competition from businesses and organisations across Edinburgh to clinch the top accolade.<br /><br />An expert panel of independent industry judges singled out QMU for its innovative business partnership and engagement work, including the new Scottish Centre for Food Development &amp; Innovation at QMU, the new Student Tourism Ambassador Role Scotland (STARS) initiative at Edinburgh Airport, supporting graduate start-up companies in the creative industries sector and the University's ambitions for the use of the land across the campus.</p>
<p>The judges were looking for a high degree of creativity and dynamic approach to new market growth and those who had successfully developed and implemented innovative products and services.</p>
<p>QMU was recognised for clearly demonstrating its vision to be an organisation of ideas and influence by addressing the future market needs. The judges also highlighted QMU's dynamic ‘can do’ attitude and delivering excellent results.<br /><br />Professor Petra Wend, Principal and Vice Chancellor of Queen Margaret University, said: "We're extremely proud to have won the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce 'Innovation in Business’ award 2016.<br /><br />"This latest industry award for QMU is further evidence of how the University continues to demonstrate innovation in both how we operate ourselves and in the way in which we engage with the business community to drive growth, through being responsive, creative, relevant and practical in focus. <br /><br />"In particular, the award recognises our work in food and drink development and innovation, in supporting graduate start-ups in the creative industries and the promotion of our aspirations for land across the campus."</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">David Birrell, Chief Executive, Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, said: “Edinburgh and Scotland needs to continue to embrace innovation and focus on raising expectations, to allow us to remain competitive on an international level. It was therefore great to see some of the exciting initiatives in the city showcased in the hotly contested ‘Innovation in Business’ category. Queen Margaret University’s focus in this area is inspiring.” <br /><br />To find out more about how QMU’s expertise could help your business contact Miriam Smith, Business Development Manager, E: <a href="mailto:msmith3@qmu.ac.uk">msmith3@qmu.ac.uk,</a> T: 0131 474 0000. <br /><br /></p>]]></Value>
