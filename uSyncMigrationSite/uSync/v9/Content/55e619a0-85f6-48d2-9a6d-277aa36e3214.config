      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">What made you choose Queen Margaret University for your studies? </span></p>
<p>I chose to study at QMU during the pandemic as the course was in my hometown and meant I could access the course easily whilst the theatre industry was dormant.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What attracted you to the MA Applied Arts and Social Practice course?</span></p>
<p>I had worked with community groups a little in my work as a theatre director and was interested in refining my skillset in facilitating groups such as this whilst I had the time. The course looked like it covered a variety of topics and would link us up with practitioners specialising in applied theatre in Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What were some of the highlights of the course?</span></p>
<p>I really enjoyed connecting with my fellow classmates. It was coincidentally an all-female group and everyone had different creative practices, which was really lovely. We also got to spend some time working at North Edinburgh Arts Centre which I found beneficial for practical work. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What challenges did you face with the course and/or university life? How did you overcome them?</span></p>
<p>The first term of classes was in person, which we were very lucky to do during COVID. However, our second term and final project time was all remote due to lockdowns coming into force, which was challenging as it meant we couldn’t apply anything we had learnt in the theory sessions into practice in person with community groups.</p>
<p>To work around this, I used my final project to work online with a group of fantastic women who live with chronic illness and therefore wouldn’t have been able to attend in person sessions anyway so for us it didn’t matter that it was remote.</p>
<p>It showed me that it is possible to connect with a group and make creative work together possible remotely. </p>
<p><span class="lead">And did you feel like you could get the help you need from the staff if you needed support?</span></p>
<p>The first term felt really supported and engaging as we were studying on campus. Being able to work at North Edinburgh Arts was also helpful.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></p>
<p>If there are any specific industry practitioners you are keen to meet or be introduced to, it’s definitely worth asking. The course leaders may be able to organise a talk with them or a meeting.</p>
<p>I wish I had done that more. The practitioners we had were wonderful but mostly visual-art based. I would have liked to be linked up with more theatre-based practitioners.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Can you tell us about your career path post-graduation?</span></p>
<p>I’m now back working full time as a freelance theatre director in Scotland and the UK. I work predominantly at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland as a visiting director, A Play, A Pie and A Pint in Glasgow and am currently working at Dundee Rep.</p>
<p>I have been able to feed in some of the practices I learnt whilst on the course to my work and am keen to do more.</p>
