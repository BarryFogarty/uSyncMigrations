      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Why appealed to you about studying at QMU? </span><br />After speaking with a lot of colleges, I decided the QMU Marketing Management degree was the best because it had the fullest programme and the most modules. It also had really interesting courses. I liked it from the first time I spoke with director.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Was it important for you to study with a UK university? </span><br />I really want to work around Europe, so I wanted a degree from a foreign university because I think it opens more doors in Europe.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you feel connected to QMU during your time as a student? </span><br />As a Student Ambassador, I spoke with many students at QMU, which made my connection even better. And I also spent a lot of time on the website and at the library whenever I needed information, so I felt a part of the university.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you feel like there was enough of a balance between practice and theory? </span><br />We did a lot of exercises that were practical – we had to create our own products and campaigns – which helped me become a better photographer, I became a better entrepreneur too I think, and a better businesswoman.</p>
<p><span class="lead">So you were studying very hard and running your own business, did you have any time for anything else?</span> We think it's important for students to have some fun as well and be able to relax.<br />After studying Marketing, I have found a better way of working. I do more planning. Everything is more professional. And if you have a schedule, you have the time. I wake up early in the morning and I stay up late at night, so I had time to learn Russian.</p>
<p><span class="lead">And did you feel like you could get the help you needed from the QMU staff if you needed support?</span><br />My teacher and programme leader was always by my side every time I needed her. Her office was always open. When I wanted something - whether it was for college or any other problem I had - her door was always open. We talked a lot. I think the teachers see if someone has a problem and will do what needs to be done.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What did you like best about QMU?</span> <br />For me it was a great experience. I like the class. I like the way that the lessons were delivered, that we have videos and photos. I was a student at Greek university before - I studied Statistics - but the lessons were quite boring. Here there was a lot more interactions.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What's happening next?</span><br />I'm looking at doing a masters in England. Something like digital marketing or business, something like that.</p>]]></Value>
