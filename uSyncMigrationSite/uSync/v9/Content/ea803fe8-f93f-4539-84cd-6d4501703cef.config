Your bedroom will be inspected once each semester for damage and cleanliness. Your kitchen will be checked every two weeks.</p>\n<p>We have designed a cleaning rota to help you – you will find this on the notice board in your flat kitchen, along with details of when the fortnightly cleaning check of communal areas will take place. This is to ensure that you are cleaning the flat to an acceptable standard. However, you should not only rely on the cleaning schedule. Kitchen and Bedroom work surfaces – Please do not put hot items on these surfaces as this is liable to cause damage to them and you will be charged for their renewal.</p>\n<p>Tips…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GRILL PANS must be kept clean and free of grease at all times as they pose a serious fire risk. You should line your grill pan with tin foil and change it regularly to assist with this. Many unwanted fire alarm activations are attributed to dirty grill pans.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>TOASTERS please ensure you clean your toaster regularly by emptying the crumbs, as not cleaning will result in the stale bread inside them burning which is not only a health and safety issue but it will also cause the circuit breaker within the flat to activate and you will have no power to the sockets<strong>  </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>VACUUM CLEANERS - Ensure your vacuum cleaner is clean at all times if you find that the vacuum cleaner has stopped lifting, check that the pipes and hoses are free from blockages and that the bag inside is not full. New vacuum bags can obtained from the Accommodation Reception.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>SHOWER CURTAINS AND MATTRESS PROTECTORS these should be washed regularly and can be put in the washing machine with your normal washing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Change of Home Address</strong></p>\n<p>If your home address and/or emergency contact details change, you must inform the Accommodation Services by email immediately so that your file can be updated.</p>\n<p><strong>Complaints Procedure</strong></p>\n<p>QMU are keen to record, investigate and respond to legitimate complaints.

Any candles found in the residences will be removed by staff.
