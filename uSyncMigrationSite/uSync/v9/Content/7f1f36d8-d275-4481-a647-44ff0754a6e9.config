Obesity and related health problems are a major health concern at national (UK) and international levels, leading not just to poorer health in the population but also to increasing costs of providing necessary health care. There is therefore an immediate need to address these issues in policy and practice. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW102292163 BCX0\">However, over many years the links between intake of sugars and health outcomes was poorly understood. In particular, there was lack of consensus as to whether excess consumption of sugar would inevitably lead to weight gain and other problems. Whereas, many suggested that there was such a link, others argued that individuals who consumed excess amounts of sugar potentially might reduce calorie intake in other foods in their diets to avoid weight gain. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW102292163 BCX0\">Better understanding was needed as to whether individuals did alter other parts of their diets to avoid weight gain, or if energy intake from sugar was added to other dietary energy intake leading to weight gain and the risks that go with that. This understanding was required for policy-makers to produce policy and practice to improve public health.</span></p>"
