    "title": "Course overview",
    "content": "<p>The course develops a comprehensive understanding of the social, cultural, and business frameworks of the film industries. This is informed by and informs central and under-valued roles in the industry, like film promotion, sales and distribution, policy, education and outreach, fundraising and sponsorship, research and consultancy, project management or programming and exhibition.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, the film industry consists of a complex network of people, companies and institutions. Through this course, film and media studies graduates, professionals and those wishing to work in film, will gain a detailed look at the different routes and jobs in the industry. In the film sector, a skills gap was identified among recent graduates, whose priorities are centred around the creative roles of film director, editor or screen writer. There is however a growing and urgent need for professionals whose focus is on the film world as an industry, which requires people with fusion skills, (creative, technical and entrepreneurial skills across the value chain), problem solving and analytical skills (pre- and post-production), and cross-cultural insights in the continued globalization and networked world. This course engages students with indepth knowledge of, and insight in, the global film industries’ increasingly networked and professional versatility.</p>\n<p>By understanding the elements of production, distribution and exhibition, you will learn how to be most effective as a cog on a film set. You will gain insight into film policy, pre-production, sales and distribution networks and programming/curation. Drawing on QMU’s existing portfolio of courses in Business, PR, Film, Media and Cultural Industries, this new course has been inspired by the professional experiences of our academic staff. We have solid relationships with the local and the international film sector in policy, sales and distribution, film exhibition and education.</p>"
