      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Inclusive provision for all students</span></p>
<p>We provide a range of services and facilities which may in some part meet your specific needs. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A campus which is wheelchair accessible, with lift access to all teaching rooms and facilities.</li>
<li>Fitted induction loops in the large lecture theatres, infra-red systems in the smaller lecture theatres and portable induction loop systems for all other teaching venues.</li>
<li>A quiet AT room (to access this, please enquire at the <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/348cf564986f47b790d25bfaf281a6e4}" title="Disability Service">Disability Service</a>)</li>
<li>Guidance and training in the use of assistive technology to help with your coursework.</li>
<li>Academic support, including advice on appropriate study skills and academic writing from the <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/e2cf0dcc90fc4d35884f11705becdf64}" title="Effective Learning Service (ELS)">Effective Learning Service</a>.</li>
<li>Academic Disabled Student Coordinators within each department, offering a first point of contact for disabled students requiring advice or information.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Additional provision particular to the needs of individual students</span></p>
<p>The Disability Service can also assist students to access additional arrangements and facilities which are not generally available to all students at QMU. To access any of these you will need to provide written evidence of your illness or impairment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Needs Assessment appointment – this is a one-to-one meeting with a Disability Adviser to discuss and agree what support, facilities or adjustments you may require. This usually takes place prior to the start of your course.</li>
<li>Access to sole use of assistive software or equipment, and training in its use, if you are unable to make use of standard campus facilities or require specialist software or equipment.</li>
<li>Access to one-to-one support, such as communication support (interpreters, note-takers or ENTs) or personal assistance.</li>
<li>Study support/mentoring.</li>
<li>Access to any other facilities or services which might bear an additional cost.</li>
<li>Where students are eligible, the Disability Service will make recommendations that such costs are met through the Disabled Students Allowance. For all other students, reasonable costs will be met by the University.</li>
<li>Adjustments to exam or assessment arrangements (such as additional time or the use of a PC/scribe).</li>
<li>Adjustments relating to how your course is taught or how course information is delivered (such as provision of handouts in advance or permission to record).</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive, and key to the provision of such additional arrangements or facilities is the impact of illness or impairment on the <strong>individual</strong> student, following their <strong>particular</strong> chosen course of study.</p>
