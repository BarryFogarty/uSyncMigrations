    "content": "<p>Professor Coutts took up appointment as Dean of the School of Health Sciences at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh from 1<sup>st</sup> September 2010. The School of Health Sciences at Queen Margaret University runs the largest range of allied health based programmes in Scotland alongside its well established Nursing programmes. With over 26 years of experience in Higher Education in Scotland, England and overseas, Professor Coutts has an eclectic view of education leadership and education in practice from pre-registration undergraduate and masters, post registration Masters to Doctoral studies. Development of overseas programmes through Transnational Education Partnerships for example Slovenia, Russia, Greece, Egypt, Saudi Arabia etc. is a key achievement. This sits alongside the development of widening participation and engagement with learner transitions through the South East Scotland Academy Partnership (SESAP) for Health and Social Care and Food Science and Nutrition,  and “Broken Bodies” (case study hands on experience for S1-2 pupils), which run within the School.</p>\n<p>Working as a clinical physiotherapist in NHS hospitals, in particular, Princess Margaret Rose Orthopaedic Hospital, Edinburgh and Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, London, Professor Coutts shaped her professional interest in management of long term Orthopaedic and Musculoskeletal conditions and her research interest in Human Movement Science. After entering academia in 1989 at the University of East London (UEL), Professor Coutts became programme leader for the first post graduate MSc in Orthopaedic and Neurological Physiotherapy in the UK. Progressing to Principal lecturer and Acting Head of Physiotherapy, Professor Coutts left UEL in 2004 to return to Edinburgh.  In August 2004 she returned to Queen Margaret University as a lecturer, became Head of Physiotherapy in 2007, Acting Dean in January 2010 and Dean in September 2010.  Gaining her Professorship in 2016 in recognition of her Academic Leadership and Research has been the pinnacle of achievement in her career as a Physiotherapist, Lecturer and Academic Leader.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities of the Dean</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide academic and operational leadership of the School, implementing University strategy and developing innovative strategies for the subject areas and activities within the School.</li>\n<li>Accountable for guiding and directing colleagues towards achieving continuous improvement in the quality of teaching, learning and research in the School, and for effective resource management.</li>\n<li>To contribute, as part of the Executive Board, to the planning and development of strategic direction of the University, and to undertake specific corporate responsibilities as allocated in addition to the management of the School.</li>\n<li>To facilitate and oversee productive collaborations with academic and commercial partners of the School in the UK and abroad.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Vision for the School is:</strong></p>\n<p>The School of Health Sciences at QMU will be Scotland’s Centre of Excellence in Nursing and Healthcare. Our ambition is for healthcare education and knowledge generation to be at the heart of a trans-generational community.
