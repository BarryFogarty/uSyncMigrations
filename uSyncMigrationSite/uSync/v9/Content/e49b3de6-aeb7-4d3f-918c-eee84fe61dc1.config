<ul>
<li>you contest the accuracy of the data (for a period that enables us to check it);</li>

<li>we no longer need the data, but you require it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
<li>you have objected (as above) and are awaiting confirmation as to whether we have overriding legitimate grounds for processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong>: if our processing is based on your consent or necessary to carry out our contract with you, and is carried out by automated means, you can request a copy of the personal information you have provided to us and the transfer of this to someone else. Where technically feasible, you can ask us to transfer it directly.</li>
<li><strong>Complain to the Information Commissioner</strong>: the Information Commissioner is the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues. We aim to resolve all complaints internally via our data protection officer who can be contacted as described at HRGDPR@qmu.ac.uk, but you do have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner at any time.</li>
