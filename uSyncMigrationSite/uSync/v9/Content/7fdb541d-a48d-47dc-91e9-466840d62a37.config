We have a focus on doing research that ‘humanises healthcare’ by keeping the person at the centre of care, as well as promoting new methodologies for person-centred research and that influence international developments in this field. Ultimately, our research work aims to enhance people’s experiences of care and wellbeing, making a difference to people’s lives locally, nationally and internationally.</p>\n<p><strong>Our aims are to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish a programme of interdisciplinary person-centred research- that is creative, innovative, and rigorous, and generates new knowledge to humanise health and social care</li>\n<li>Make a significant contribution to the development of Person-Centred methodology for undertaking person- centred research</li>\n<li>Support early carrier academics and scholars who are committed to person centredness and person centred Research</li>\n<li>Contribute to local, national, and international communities who are committed to person-centredness and person-centred research</li>\n<li>Have local, national, international impact on the way that health and social care services are delivered, experienced and evaluated</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We continuously seek to develop a wide range of collaborations and warmly welcome approaches from individuals and groups who would like to find out more about our research and see potential in us working together. </strong></p>\n<p>Our current research activates are around 3 core themes. Central to these is ensuring that our research impacts on the way health and social care services are delivered and in particular, on the lives of those delivering and receiving care with the aim of enhancing their wellbeing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interventions/Model of Care in health and social care and practice to enhance person-centeredness and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Person Centred Culture, Leadership and Education</li>\n<li>Use of Creative Arts within health and social care to improve person-centredness and wellbeing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Capacity and capability building for the longer term within our research field is an important focus for our work as we continue to nurture academics and scholars who are committed to person-centredness and person-centred research and who themselves will have global impact. As part of this we have two related, thriving communities: The International Community of Practice (ICoP) and the Doctoral Student ICoP (SICoP) all connected through at least one of the four pillars of person-centredness.</p>"
