    "content": "<p>This Person-centred Practice Framework approach is for graduates and practitioners who wish to develop their careers in the broad field of health and social care systems. This includes an array of settings in which you support people with their mental health, for example, community based health and social care, residential care settings, criminal justice and education. You can also sign up to study single modules.</p>\n<p>The routes in the Person-Centred Practice Framework seek to influence and enable the transformative processes of personal and professional development through engagement, facilitation and evaluation of person-centred teaching and learning approaches. It is designed to meet the professional needs of practitioners from all disciplines working in a variety of different health and care system settings. The framework is innovative and interactive, emphasising application of theory to your practice context. It will enable you to critically engage with, evaluate and synthesise the evidence and research to promote the development and enhancement of person-centred culture and practice. This develops a pro-active, transformative and reflective approach to meeting the health and social needs of individuals, families, groups and populations.</p>\n<p>If you wish to study for a Postgraduate Certificate (PgCert) in Mental Health and Wellbeing, there is one core module on mental illness and distress. You can then choose two optional mental health modules to advance practice in your desired area of interest and/or that is relevant to your practice. </p>\n<p>If you wish to further progress your studies, you can study for a Postgraduate Diploma (PgDip) in Person-centred Practice (Mental Health and Wellbeing).  This provides the opportunity to complete two modules on person-centredness. You then have the option to study a module that is appropriate to your desired option or professional background. </p>\n<p>To achieve a Masters (MSc) in Person-centred Practice, there is a core module to complete which is a dissertation project.  This provides the flexibility to focus the project on an area of interest that is related to mental health and wellbeing. </p>\n<p>We are proud of the varied and progressive approaches to learning which we offer, and international students are particularly welcome to apply.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Our teaching, learning and assessment strategy is framed by our core philosophical concepts of personhood, person-centredness, human valuing, healthful relations, human potential and development, and supportive and enabling environments. Central to this strategy is the need for learners to engage in the learning experiences, a readiness to listen and explore, preparedness to be open to experiences and a resolve to keep going. This environment will generate an ethos of engagement where students can explore and challenge theories, practices and different sources of knowledge creatively in an atmosphere of high challenge and high support.</p>\n<p>Students will be supported to challenge their thinking, values and beliefs, through the posing of complex activities and questions, and develop resilient and sustainable approaches to their learning and practice in response to these. Critical to this process is the use of diverse knowledge, scholarly inquiry processes and evidence-informed materials to engage and enliven the processes of learning. Assessment strategies will encourage application to practice. This will be achieved through the use of varied strategies that draw on the student’s own areas of practice such as portfolio development, practice proposals, annotated bibliographies, simulation events, games, seminar presentations and self-determined contextual assignment topics. Tutor, peer and self-assessment, including within virtual environments (eg HUB@QMU), will be an important component of approaches to formative and summative assessment. For students undertaking NMC-recognised specialist qualification and registration (District Nursing, Health Visiting, School Nursing), the course is 50% practice-based and requires placement in an approved practice. To support learners in their practice learning environment they will be assigned to a Practice Supervisor and a Practice Assessor. Placement will be negotiated with your supporting NHS area.</p>"
