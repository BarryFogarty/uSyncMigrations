      <Value><![CDATA[<p>With growing interest in applied arts and social practice, this PgCert will allow students to graduate with a better understanding of how artists, theatre practitioners and other creatives apply their skills in social contexts, third sector organisations, public health, social welfare, education and criminal justice, while giving them the practical and enterprise skills to develop a sustainable career in their chosen field.</p>
<p>The combination of modules makes this PgCert, and indeed the full MA, unique in Scotland. The flexible study options and diverse curriculum make it particularly suitable if you are already working in the sector or wish to do so while studying.</p>

It also aims to provide students with the enterprise skills to establish and market themselves as applied arts practitioners in a professional context.</p>\n<p>You may find it particularly suitable if you have already worked within social practice, or wish to broaden your understanding of your professional social practice. The course also works well for people with significant workplace experience who want to gain a formal qualification in a flexible manner.</p>\n<p>Over the past three decades within the UK, there has been a significant and sustained growth of the arts within a social context. Indeed, the proposed Cultural Strategy in Scotland currently looks at embedding artistic and creative practices across numerous sectors, inviting artists, theatre makers, musicians, and all creative practitioners to be productive within industry, business, education and social settings.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the arts are becoming more important within health and well-being contexts and the recent national report <em>Creative Health: Arts for Health and Wellbeing</em> calls for artists to play a vital role in the social health and well-being of the population to the extent that GP’s in Scotland and England can prescribe artistic activities in order to tackle social issues such as obesity, loneliness, and depression. This MA will provide qualified students to service the growing demand for this type of creative practice.</p>\n<p> </p>"
