      <Value><![CDATA[<p>3.1   Validation events normally take place four to eight months prior to the commencement of the programme, allowing time for the validation process to be completed and for the Programme Team to meet conditions if necessary.</p>
<p>3.2   Validation of a new programme must take place within 18 months of approval of the proposal by Senate. This is not flexible. If an extension is sought, the proposal must be referred via the School Academic Board to the Learning and Teaching Panel, which reports to the Student Experience Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Key stages</strong></p>
<p>Step 1 - The Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement contacts the Programme Leader to make arrangements for the validation.</p>
<p>Step 2 - The validation documentation is forwarded to the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement by the agreed date, which can be no later than four weeks prior to the event.</p>
<p>Step 3 - A draft event timetable, list of Panel members and copy of the validation documentation will be forwarded to each member of the Panel by the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement. Any written comments from the Panel will be submitted to the Programme Leader for consideration.</p>
<p>Step 4 - The validation event occurs.</p>
<p>Step 5 - A summary and full report of the validation are produced and circulated to all Panel members, the Programme Leader and Head of Division.</p>
<p>Step 6 - Recommendations from Panel are reported to the Student Experience Committee, which advises Senate on programme approval. Senate has final authority to approve all new programmes.</p>
<p>Step 8 - The Programme Leader produces and submits a Definitive Programme Document to the Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement.</p>]]></Value>

The Head of Division (or nominee) will make initial contact with the proposed external Panel member to ascertain their availability. The Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement will subsequently confirm approval and liaise directly on the event arrangements.</p>\n<p>3.6   The Programme Leader should meet with the Secretary and relevant School Manager before submission of documentation. This allows the Secretary to brief the Programme Leader on the detail of the validation process. It also allows the Programme Leader to brief the Secretary on any particular requirements or circumstances such as the involvement of PSRBs, collaboration or a change to established procedures. The School Manager can offer advice and guidance on School policy and regulations.</p>"

    "content": "<p>3.13   The primary function of the Panel is to evaluate the rationale and coherence, separately and collectively of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand, recruitment and admissions;</li>\n<li>Aims and learning outcomes;</li>\n<li>Programme structure and content;</li>\n<li>Learning, teaching and assessment;</li>\n<li>Student support;</li>\n<li>Programme management;</li>\n<li>Quality assurance and enhancement;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.14   Within the themes listed in paragraph 3.13, the Panel will consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall rationale and demand for the programme, including how it meets the needs of stakeholders and communities;</li>\n<li>Articulation with the <a href=\"https://scqf.org.uk/\">Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework</a>;</li>\n<li>Alignment with <a href=\"https://www.qaa.ac.uk/quality-code/subject-benchmark-statements\">QAA Subject Benchmark Statements</a> and other external reference points;</li>\n<li>Alignment with QMU strategies, Graduate Attributes and other internal reference points;</li>\n<li>Adherence to QMU or PSRB regulations, policies and procedures;</li>\n<li>The accessibility of the award for all students<a name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\"><span>[1]</span></a>;</li>\n<li>Commitment to widening access and retention, including through contextualised admissions;</li>\n<li>The staff experience, including support and development opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.15   Following scrutiny of the documentation, the Panel may agree that certain issues are clear and do not require further discussion. This will be recorded in the report of the event.</p>\n<p>3.16   The Panel should adopt a peer group approach to provide a constructive and collegiate setting, while at the same time conducting a rigorous evaluation of the merits of the submission.</p>\n<p>3.17   Having scrutinised the proposal, the Panel may recommend to the Student Experience Committee and Senate that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The programme be validated subject to conditions (all conditions must be satisfied before the programme can be considered validated);</li>\n<li>The programme be validated (with further advisory recommendations, as appropriate);</li>\n<li>The programme be not validated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.18   Conditions of validation relate to issues that, if not satisfactorily addressed, would prevent the programme from running. Panels are therefore expected to maintain a clear distinction between mandatory conditions, and recommendations, which are advisory in nature. Where the Panel imposes a significant number of conditions, this may bring into question the validity of the programme. The maximum number of conditions applied should normally not exceed five. In cases where more than five conditions are set by the Panel, the programme will not normally be validated. Conditions and recommendations should be stated in clear and unambiguous terms. Any bullet points or sub headings attached to conditions must relate directly to the condition.</p>\n<p>3.19   Panels are not permitted to set resource related conditions, as these will have been addressed prior to the event progressing. However, if a Panel has any concerns, these may be discussed with the Team at the event, or on request through a separate meeting with the Dean and/or Head of Division. Where the Panel feels unable to validate the programme on the basis of unresolved resource issues, this should be referred to the School Academic Board for consideration and response.</p>\n<p>3.20   If the programme is validated, or validated, subject to conditions, then the Panel must also set the date for review. This is usually five years, based on the nature of the programme, including discipline, mode of delivery and duration.</p>\n<p>3.21   Normally all proposals must undergo a validation event by May of the preceding academic session at the latest if they are to be offered in the following academic session. Extensions beyond 31 May require the approval of the Assistant Secretary, Governance and Quality Enhancement, who will take advice from the University Secretary, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>3.22   The Panel will identify aspects of the programme worthy of commendation and wider dissemination. Such commendations relating to areas of innovation and exceptional practice will be detailed in report of the event.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span>[1]</span></a> Teams are expected to pay due regard to relevant legislation and, where appropriate, to promote equality in respect of the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/equality/equality-act-2010/protected-characteristics\" title=\"Protected Characteristics - Equality and Human Rights Commission\">protected characteristics, as defined under the Equality Act 2010</a>. The nine protected characteristics are age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation.</p>"
