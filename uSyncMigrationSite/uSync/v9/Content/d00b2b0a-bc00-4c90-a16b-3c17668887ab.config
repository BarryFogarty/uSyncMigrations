      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Maj Meah (25) from Dundee, has secured the graduate position with Edinburgh-based i4 Product Design as a Market Researcher, following his successful application to the <a href="https://www.hie.co.uk/our-region/regional-projects/scotgrad/" title="ScotGrad Programme">ScotGrad Programme</a>, which offers paid, project-based student and graduate placements in dynamic organisations across Scotland.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Maj, who attended Harris Academy and Dundee College, graduated with a BA (Hons) in Public Relations and Media from QMU in July 2015. Since then, he has gained significant experience working with award-winning PR and marketing organisations, including Holyrood Partnership and QMU’s Marketing &amp; Communications Office.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">In his new role with i4 Product Design, Maj hopes to widen his skills set by getting hands-on experience with digital media, events, business development tasks and working with a team of dedicated experts to help create products for ambitious start-up companies to global market leaders, some of which include Bosch, Optos (a Nikon company), Flymo and NCR – a company that designs, engineers and manufactures cash dispensers.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">As part of the Scotgrad Placement Programme, Maj will have access to a free three-day business and employability skills residential course and will also benefit from ongoing support from the ScotGrad team throughout the duration of his new graduate role</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Commenting on his new graduate position, Maj said: “I’m really excited about joining such a dynamic and growing product design firm so soon after graduating and can't wait to hit the ground running.”</p>
<p>"Applying for the position through ScotGrad was very positive experience. It's a structured process of applying for jobs and there are many opportunities for personal development that comes with the scheme. This will definitely benefit me in the long run.”</p>
<p>"My degree combined with work experience has really helped me in securing this job. I’m also thankful for the continued advice and support I’ve received from my mentor at QMU as part of the Employer Mentoring Scheme. My mentor was extremely beneficial and gave me confidence when it was most needed in my search for a job after graduating.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">In his new role Maj will be supporting i4 Product Design’s Business Development Manager, Tristan Elliott, who managed the ScotGrad hiring process on behalf of i4. Tristan said: “We’re very pleased to have Maj join the growing ‘Business Team’. i4 is currently in a five year growth plan and we’ve seen a high demand for the company’s specialty of designing beautiful products that are also flawlessly engineered. As part of these plans, Maj will be pivotal in increasing the company’s presence online and in person across the UK and mainland Europe.”</p>
