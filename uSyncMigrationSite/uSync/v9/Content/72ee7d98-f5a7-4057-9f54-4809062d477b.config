      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Urszula found out about the QMU Employer Mentoring Programme during the third year of her studies. She was unsure of which career path to follow, so QMU’s Careers &amp; Employability team matched Urszula with Jennifer Campbell from Edinburgh-based estate agents and solicitors, Simpson and Marwick. Jennifer gave Urszula one-to-one mentoring advice and guidance on a career in law.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Urszula was based in the Netherlands whilst taking part in the Mentoring Programme, so she got a lot of guidance from Jennifer by email. During this time Urszula became much more interested in sustainability and the environment. Although those themes were not main areas of Jennifer’s expertise, she helped Urszula to structure her action plan and achieve her goals.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Jennifer also helped Urszula to prepare for assessment centers for postgraduate programmes. She suggested that Urszula may be more suited to work in small organisations based on her character and personality.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Commenting on her experience of the QMU Employer Mentoring Programme, Urszula said: “I’d definitely recommend QMU’s Careers and Employability service to other students, even if they’ve already made future career plans. Given my experience, you never know if you will stick with your initial plans. My mentor helped me focus on my strengths and the practical things I can do to achieve my new objectives." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p> </p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">During her time at QMU, the Careers &amp; Employability team also helped Urszula find part-time work at Heriot Watt University to support herself through her studies and get some experience in business and academic environment. The team also supported Urszula with writing her CV, and applying to postgraduate study programmes.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The team enabled Urszula to put the career plan made with her mentor into action. The team also arranged meetings with people who could help Urszula make a decision on which postgraduate study programme to choose.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Urszula is now studying MSc in Carbon Management at the University of Edinburgh. She managed to secure a full scholarship for her postgraduate studies after winning the Green Challenge Postcode Lottery Scholarship.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Urszula was successful in securing an internship as an Active Travel Coordinator at Edinburgh College through the Environmental Placement Programme, run by Bright Green Business. The Programme sees the placement of students and graduates in host companies for 8-12 weeks where they work on an environmental project. She was kept in her role and is working part-time with Edinburgh College to complete the work she started during the summer time.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Urszula was also the joint winner of a judges commendation award at the Bright Green Placements Awards Ceremony, which took place at the Scottish Parliament in September 2016.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The award was presented to Urszula and fellow Active Travel Coordinator, Tom Kemsley, for their work at QMU and Edinburgh College to improve facilities and engagement with cycling on the two campuses and the progress they have made to help achieve Cycle Friendly Campus Awards.</p>
