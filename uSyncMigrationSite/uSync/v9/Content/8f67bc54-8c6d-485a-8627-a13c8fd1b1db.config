<p><span class="lead">1.0 Introduction</span></p>
<p>The following sets out the procedures to be followed when engaging non-core staff to carry out work for the university. This procedure exists in order to ensure a consistent approach is applied when engaging with and paying non-core staff for work they carry out, additionally it also exists to ensure that relevant checks such as right to work in the UK and Disclosure Scotland are correctly adhered to for all noncore staff.</p>
<p>Non-core staff are defined as those that do not occupy a position within the university’s core structure and are expected to work 8 days (56 hours) or less over a 12 month period.</p>
<p>This procedure applies only to non-core staff to be paid through the university’s payroll. Arrangements with self-employed suppliers are out with the scope of this procedure, advice regarding the process to be followed should be sought from Finance.</p>
<p>Payments to UK based External Examiners are also out with the scope of this procedure.</p>
<p><span class="lead">2.0 Establishing the Requirement for a Non-Core Post</span></p>
<p>The first step in this procedure is the requirement for a post to be established, at this stage if it is envisaged that the work is likely to be for 8 days (56 hours) or more over a 12 month period then this procedure is not appropriate and the VAP Procedure should be referred to.</p>
<p>In general terms non-core posts will be</p>
<ul>
<li>To work 8 days (56 hours) or less over a 12 month period;</li>
<li>For short, one off discrete pieces of work relating to teaching and / or research</li>
<li>For short, one off discrete pieces of work relating to professional support;</li>
<li>To cover work relating to expertise that does not exist within the core structure;</li>
<li>For short term cover for emergencies such as sickness absence;</li>
<li>For short term seasonal staffing requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">3.0 Approval Procedure</span></p>
<p>3.1 Where the need for a non-core post is established the requester should complete the Request to Employ Non-Core Staff form, the form should be completed in advance of the assignment start date. Once completed the form should be sent to the budget holder for signature.</p>
<p>Please note that retrospective applications must be countersigned by the Dean (for academic appointments) and Head of Department (for professional services appointments).</p>
<p>3.2 Where the budget holder does not approve the Request to Employ Non-Core Staff form they should discuss this with the requester. Where the budget holder does approve the Request to Employ Non-Core Staff form the form should be signed and forwarded to Human Resources.</p>
<p>3.3 Human Resources will verify that all the required information is completed on the Request to Employ Non-Core Staff form and record the details on the tracker.</p>
<p>3.4 The Budget Holder must ensure there is sufficient budget available before making a commitment for payment. The Budget holder is responsible and accountable for the management of their Budget.</p>
<p><span class="lead">4.0 HR Registration</span></p>
<p>The HR Registration process ensures that the relevant pre-employment checks are carried out prior to an individual undertaking any work for the university; this ensures that the university is complying with legislation regarding employment status, UKVI (eligibility to work) and Disclosure Scotland.</p>
<p>The university recognises that very often when engaging with non-core staff to carry out short term, discrete pieces of work an individual will be identified in advance.</p>
<p>Where it is not the case that an individual has been identified the requesting line manager or Head of Division/Department should contact Human Resources for advice on sourcing an appropriate person.</p>
<p><span class="lead">In all cases non-core staff must have completed the HR Registration process before they are permitted to undertake any work for the university.</span> Payment may be withheld from an individual if they have not met with the requirement of the HR Registration process.</p>
<p>It may be the case that individuals who have worked for the university prior to the introduction of this procedure have fully or partially met the requirements of the HR Registration process, HR will be able to advise on individual cases.</p>
<p><span class="lead">5.0 HR Registration Procedure</span></p>
<p>The HR Registration procedure consists of the following mandatory preemployment checks</p>
<ul>
<li>UKVI Eligibility to Work check</li>
<li>Disclosure Scotland regulated work check (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other relevant information such as bank details, contact details, emergency contacts and information for the purposes of equal opportunities monitoring will be collected during the HR Registration process.</p>
<p><span class="lead">5.2 UKVI Eligibility to Work Check</span></p>
<p>Evidence of eligibility to work in the UK must be obtained for all non-core staff before any work is undertaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>The line manager or HR should see either the individual’s passport or other acceptable documentation (details of acceptable documentation are provided on the HR Registration Form). The line manager or HR should make a copy of the front page and photo page of the passport and record on the HR Registration Form that the original has been seen, the copy should be attached to the HR Registration Form for submission to Human Resources.</li>
<li>Human Resources will record the passport (or other) information and expiry date if applicable on iTrent for monitoring purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">5.3 Disclosure Scotland Regulated Work Check</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the post requires membership of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups scheme should be noted on the Request to Employ Non-Core Staff form</li>
<li>If required, Human Resources will send the necessary Disclosure Scotland application form to the individual along with the HR Registration Form.</li>
<li>The individual should return the completed disclosure form and three pieces of original ID (one being photographic) to Human Resources.</li>
<li>Please allow 2 – 4 weeks for Disclosure Scotland to process an application for member of the PVG scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">6.0 Completion of the HR Registration Procedure</span></p>
<p>Once the HR Registration Form has been completed and Human Resources are satisfied that the relevant checks are complete, Human Resources will issue a notification to the individual and requesting manager that the individual may commence work.</p>
<p><span class="lead">7.0 Payment for Non-Core Staff</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the HR Registration process is complete and the hours have been worked the individual can complete the Non-Core Staff Payment Form and submit to the budget holder for authorisation.</li>
<li>The Non-Core Staff payment Form should then be sent to Human Resources to verify that the work is in line with what was detailed on the Request to Employ Non-Core Staff form, where a discrepancy is<br />identified this will be discussed with the budget holder as appropriate.</li>
<li>Where Human Resources verify that all details are correct the payment will be recorded on iTrent and passed to payroll for payment.</li>
</ul>
