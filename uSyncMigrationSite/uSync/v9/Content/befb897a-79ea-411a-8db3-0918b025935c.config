      <Value><![CDATA[<p>LEADING HEALTH SPECIALISTS joined community members and people living with the condition to share research and experiences of osteoporosis. The event, not only focused on bone health and prevention of falls, it was a call for osteoporosis to be viewed as a public health priority.</p>
<p>Osteoporosis is a common bone disease that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break.<br>Developing slowly over several years, it’s often only diagnosed when a fall or sudden impact causes a bone to fracture. Affecting over 3 million people in the UK (250,000 in Scotland) and accounting for around 527,000 fractures per year in the UK, QMU’s Lydia Osteoporosis Project is passionate about raising awareness to help halt the rising numbers of people affected by the condition.</p>
<p>Following discussions with conference delegates, it was clear how poorly recognised osteoporosis is. For many people living with the condition, it is a hidden disease with many people’s lives adversely affected through pain, and the length of time it often takes for the condition to be diagnosed. This is driving the Lydia Osteoporosis team to continue its work raising awareness of the condition amongst health professionals and the general public. The Lydia Project team is also keen to highlight that it’s possible to live well with the condition.</p>
<p>‘Keep moving!’ was the main message of the conference. With this being Dawn Skelton, Professor of Aging and Health and Glasgow Caledonian University’s mantra - as well as the need for an active, healthy lifestyle - delegates were invited to try a range of fun activities.</p>
<p>Dr Karen Matthews, who leads the Lydia Osteoporosis Project at QMU, explained: “This is a preventable condition and, for those living with osteoporosis, it could be managed better with improved awareness and simple lifestyle changes. We provided a range of interactive sessions for people to try, such as Scottish step dancing supported by fabulous Scottish fiddle music; weightlifting; balance classes; and nutritious cooking workshops.</p>
<p>“So, aside from the serious topics such as pregnancy associated osteoporosis, hip fractures and falls, provided by our highly respected professional speakers, there was a fun side to the event that helped educate delegates about easy ways to achieve good bone health.”</p>
<p>Dr Matthews concluded:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Our conference, held on World Osteoporosis Day, was a great way to strengthen our public health response to the prevention of osteoporosis across population groups in Scotland and beyond." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>“We will continue building networks across academia, health, and the community in the year ahead, whilst also continuing our research in the area. Currently, we are looking at incontinence as a potential barrier to bone healthy exercise. We hope to release findings on this research during 2024.”</p>

<p><span class="lead">Shocking Facts</span></p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy associated osteoporosis</strong></p>
<p>At the age of 28, Karen Whitehead’s spine collapsed during labour. She had no idea she had osteoporosis until she was in childbirth. Karen, who is now a patient advocate, attended the conference at QMU to raise awareness of pregnancy associated osteoporosis and its impact on her earlier and later life. She and Kathryn Berg shared some statistics about recent research into osteoporosis in pregnancy. Based on women living with the condition, the research found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>73% women had a fracture during pregnancy</li>
<li>90% fractured their spine</li>
<li>51% women suffered height loss</li>
<li>27% women suffered hip pain.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">EAT NUTRITIOUS FOOD</span></p>
<p>Having a healthy, nutritious diet is important to help build strong bones and reduce risk of fractures. Sue O’Neill Berest, from the Cyrenians, made some tasty dishes for our conference delegates in well attended cook-off sessions.</p>
<p><span class="lead">TOP </span><span class="lead">FIVE TIPS</span></p>
<p>Conference contributors stated the best way to support good bone health is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise – keep moving!</li>
<li>Focus on nutrition – eat a balanced diet</li>
<li>Get your daily dose of Vitamin D</li>
<li>Drink responsibly – keeping alcohol to a minimum</li>
<li>Avoid smoking</li>
</ul>]]></Value>
