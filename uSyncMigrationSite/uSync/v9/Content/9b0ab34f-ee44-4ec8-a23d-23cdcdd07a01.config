      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study film and media at QMU?</span></p>
<p>I’d always been interested in video production and did a lot of film and photography in school.</p>
<p>I’d heard that the QMU course was great and very practical-based, which was what I preferred rather than a heavily theory-based degree.</p>
<p>I also attended a QMU Open day and it was very useful in terms of getting to know the University a bit more. I think the thing that made up my mind was the general look and feel of the campus, it was clearly very new, and the facilities seemed very up to date.”<br /><span class="lead"> </span><br /><span class="lead">What was the highlight of the course for you? </span></p>
<p>In first and second year there were a few theory modules that I did enjoy but towards the end of my degree, I chose to focus on the practical side of filming, where my strengths certainly lie.</p>
<p>I still use the skills and experience gained from those classes to this day.</p>
<p>I made all of my friends through my course as well, which was great as we were able to bond over our shared enjoyment for film and media.<br /> <br />The most interesting part of the course for me was a module in which a group of us worked with an external client and produced some media content for their business. This is what sparked my interest in creating a business of my own that provides promotional material for other brands and definitely gave me an insight in how to kick things off.”<br /> <br /><span class="lead">What is your top tip for future students considering this course?</span></p>
<p>“If you’re interested in this course, I’d say go for it! It has really helped me shape a better understanding of film making and build my knowledge of real world applications.”</p>
<p><span class="lead">What have you been doing since graduating from QMU?</span></p>
<p>I set up my own business, Front Edge Media, before I graduated, so once I had graduated I was able to dedicate more time to networking and gaining more clients.</p>
<p>I also secured work experience through Santander Universities SME Internship Programme at QMU, which allowed me to create promotional videos for the Mercat Bar and Grill in East Lothian. The owner of the business put me in contact with a lot of people and many of my clients have been through him.</p>
<p>My Santander Internship with the Bar and Grill has been an invaluable experience and it was a very beneficial starting point for Front Edge Media.<br /> <br />My client base is slowly building up and I’m very excited for what the future holds for my business.</p>
<p>Calum’s company, Front Edge Media, is now based within the Business Innovation Zone at QMU, where the company benefits from access to small business start-up support and professional filming equipment, as well as guidance from the campus-based Business Gateway.</p>
