<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">It may be necessary for Data Protection Officer to carry out a ‘data protection impact assessment’ before you undertake certain activities that involve processing personal information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A ‘data protection impact assessment’ will consider the impact of the activities; identify privacy risks and steps to minimise those risks; and evaluate whether the activities are permitted by data protection law.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As such, you should seek advice from the Data Protection Officer so they can advise whether a data protection impact assessment is required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process new types of personal information i.e. personal information which has not been collected before.</li>
<li>Process personal information in a new or significantly different way, including via the use of new technologies.</li>
<li>Use personal information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected.</li>
<li>Enter a contract with a third party that involves disclosing or sharing personal information.</li>
<li> Any new or significantly different use of automated processing of personal information to evaluate an individual, for example to analyse or predict an individual’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</li>
<li>Any new or significantly different use of automated decision-making i.e. where a decision is made on a solely automated basis without meaningful human involvement, and it has a significant effect on individuals.</li>
<li> Any new or significantly different large scale processing of special categories of personal information; or large scale, systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area. Whether processing is ‘large scale’ will depend on, for example, the number of individuals, volume of data, range of data, duration of processing, or geographical extent – if you are in any doubt as to whether processing is large scale, contact the Data Protection Officer.</li>
<li>Implement significant changes to systems or the business (including new or different technology) which involve processing personal information. <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Any new direct marketing activity (including electronic marketing by email, telephone, fax or text message) that is not clearly authorised by the Director of Marketing and Communication. <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Transmit or send personal information to, or view or access personal information in, a country outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), where this has not been previously authorised by the Data Protection Officer or in line with the University Data Protection Policy. The EEA is the 28 countries in the European Union, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.<span><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p> You must comply with any directions from [the data protection [officer/manager]] in relation to the above, and the terms of any data protection impact assessment.</p>
<p> <strong>Individuals’ rights: what you need to do:-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals may have certain rights as regards their personal information, including to: </li>
<li>Receive certain information about our processing; <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Request access to their personal information that we hold (often known as a ‘subject access request’); <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Request transfer, correction, deletion, restriction of processing; <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Object to processing (including where this is for direct marketing); <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Request a copy of an agreement transferring personal information outside of the European Economic Area; <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Object to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling; <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Be notified of a personal information breach; <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Complain to the Information Commissioner; or <span><br /></span></li>
<li>Withdraw their consent to processing (if we process their personal information on the basis of their consent). </li>
</ul>
<p><span><br /></span>If you receive any communication that appears to relate to these rights, you must contact the Data Protection Officer <strong>immediately</strong>. Do not respond to the communication or attempt to deal with it without input from the Data Protection Officer. <span><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>Reporting a personal information breach:- </strong></p>
<p>A personal information breach means anything that compromises the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of personal information or the safeguards that protect it. This could include where personal information is lost, or where it is accessed, disclosed or acquired without authority. </p>
<p>If you know or suspect that there has been a personal information breach, you must preserve all evidence and <strong>immediately </strong>contact the Data Protection Officer. You must make this contact immediately (even outside of business hours and at nights or weekends) in order to: </p>
<ul>
<li>reduce the risk of damage to any affected individuals and our business; and <span><br /></span></li>
<li>allow us to comply with any obligation to notify the Information Commissioner (the UK supervisory authority for data protection) or the individuals affected. <span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><br /></span>Our procedure for dealing with suspected personal information breaches is set out in our Personal Information Breach Policy.<span><br /></span></p>
<p> <strong>Breaches of this policy:-</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>If you think you may have breached this policy, please speak to your line manager or the Data Protection Officer as soon as possible. Quick action can be crucial in mitigating the effects of a breach.</p>
<p>Breaches of this policy may be dealt with under our Disciplinary Policy and, in serious cases, may be treated as gross misconduct leading to dismissal without notice.</p>
