      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk business. When you study for a degree in business management at QMU you’ll gain a deep understanding of the nature and core functions of businesses. How do successful companies manage their resources? What’s the best way to make an organisation environmentally sustainable? What marks out a successful entrepreneur? You can study a general business management degree or (after two years of general study) decide to focus your learning on the enterprise, finance or marketing elements of business management.</p>
<p>At the heart of every successful business is an accomplished finance team. Our BA (Hons) Business Management with Finance is a specialist finance pathway that will give you the contemporary theory and practice you need to carve a career in business finance and management. In Years Three and Four modules will be tailored to your chosen route in finance. In addition, in Year Four you will undertake a finance placement and a practical, finance-based piece of independent work to develop your finance expertise in a relevant business context. The route is designed to increase your career options by providing you with a solid foundation in core principles of business management. This route is fully accredited by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA). This allows graduates from this route to gain an accelerated route to the CIMA Certificate in Business Accounting and CIMA Professional Qualification, through exemption from six professional exams.</p>
