She then moved to the School of Health Sciences at Coventry University. In 1998, she joined Keele University to develop and lead a modular postgraduate framework within the Faculty of Health. Jackie has experience in teaching behavioural sciences and research methods across postgraduate programmes in health and social science, and she has taught and supervised on professional doctorates and in education and health as well as supervising PhDs. She serves as external examiner for taught programmes and research degrees at a number of other universities. Nationally, she was chair of the Physiotherapy Research Society. Her own EdD thesis examined continuing professional development of physiotherapists in the context of NHS policy, and for this work she was awarded the Jo Campling Memorial Prize by the Academy of Social Sciences. In 2014 she was awarded a National Teaching Fellowship by the Higher Education Academy.</p>\n<p><span>Jackie is a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, has been a member of its Council and Chair of its Education Committee, and is currently on its Professional Practice Committee and shortlife working groups for apprenticeships. Recently, she chaired the Scientific Committee of the International Education Conference of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy. She has worked extensively with other HEIs in the UK and overseas, both directly and through engagement with the </span>CSP and the HCPC.
