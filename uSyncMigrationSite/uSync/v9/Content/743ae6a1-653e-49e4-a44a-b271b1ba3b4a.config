      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Heather Fulton, a second year student on the MA Arts, Festivals and Cultural Management course at QMU, was recently awarded the British Council Venice Fellowship which will take her on a visit to Venice this August alongside other UK students, graduates and researchers during the world’s most important art and architecture biennales.</p>
<p>The Venice Fellowships have been established to enrich the British Pavilion exhibition through research and discussion, and to extend its impact beyond Venice. Approximately 60 fellows – including Heather - will serve three days a week as an invigilator in the British Pavilion, with the remaining time used for study and research in response to ideas posed by the curator Ralph Rugoff that relate to the curse 'May Your Live in Interesting Times’ and/or The British Pavilion’s exhibition of Cathy Wilkes’ artworks. </p>
<p>Speaking of this exciting opportunity, Heather – who hails from Falkirk and currently works at the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, said: “I'm really over the moon to have been offered a fellowship. I've always wanted to go to Venice, especially while the Biennale is on, so it's such a privilege to be given the opportunity to work at the British Pavilion at this time.”</p>
<p>Heather was shortlisted by QMU to be interviewed by the British Council, and she was overjoyed to learn the day after speaking to the interview panel via Skype that she’d been selected. “I had actually convinced myself that I hadn't got it so was really surprised when the news arrived,” she said.</p>
<p>She continued: “I've never worked abroad before so I'm really excited about that, especially the opportunity to meet new people and broaden my network in the sector. I'm also looking forward to being able to conduct my own research whilst I'm there.” Heather’s research proposal is an exploration of how artist-led methods can be used to understand audience experience at the Biennale.</p>
<p>Dr Anthony Schrag, Lecturer in Creative Industries and Cultural Management at QMU, said: “I am excited to hear that that Heather has been granted the Venice Fellowship. I know it was a tough selection process, with many of our students presenting excellent and worthy projects, but Heather pipped them to the post with her clear and focused project proposal.</p>
<p>“She is an active, dedicated and committed student within the MA Arts, Festivals and Cultural Management course at QMU, which is a programme that seeks to understand and apply knowledge of cultural management in all its various forms and shapes, and Heather is an important part of our graduating cohort.</p>
<p>“I know this fellowship will open doors for her career and her future practice - we are all very proud of her.”</p>]]></Value>
