Practice-based learning opportunities will take place in includes the Scottish ambulance service and other clinical environments including Hospital, care homes and third sector. Building on the practice-based learning experiences gained in Year One you will continue to have opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge to practice, observe and learn from clinicians in practice as well as participating in direct care of persons.</p>\n<p><strong>Developing a Spirit of Enquiry:</strong> This module will help you to develop the skills required for a critical and enquiring approach to professional practice and further develop the skills developed in Finding your Academic Voice in Year One. You will explore concepts of ethics in the context of generating knowledge to inform paramedic practice and how to debate the strengths and limitations of differing types of evidence. We will help you to select and use information from published literature in order to make and argue a case. You will also learn how to identify the different approaches to knowledge generation and weigh up their value for professional practice. This module is very important for your understanding of evidence based paramedic practice.</p>"
