      <Value><![CDATA[<p>QMU’s new MSc Accounting and Finance has been developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cimaglobal.com/" title="Chartered Institute of Management Accountants">Chartered Institute of Management Accountants</a> (CIMA), the world’s leading and largest professional body of management accountants. With the opportunity to obtain a master’s degree in one year, a CIMA Advanced Diploma in Management Accounting qualification, and the maximum 11 exemptions from CIMA’s certificate, operational and management level examinations, the course has been carefully tailored to help those looking to move into financial management or for individuals who wish to enhance their existing accounting and finance qualifications.</p>
<p>The course will provide students with both the necessary technical skills expected of a part-qualified accountant and the critical analysis skills expected of a master’s degree graduate. Students graduating with the MSc will have expertise in the key areas of financial reporting, management accounting and corporate finance and will also have critical awareness of how these areas contribute to a company’s strategic management.</p>
<p>Students will also benefit from access to the University’s on-campus Business Gateway and <a href="/services-for-business-and-industry/business-innovation-zone/" title="Business Innovation Zone">Business Innovation Zone</a> (BIZ). The BIZ is the only facility of its kind and underlines QMU’s commitment to fostering innovation and entrepreneurship throughout the University and local area.</p>
<p>Dr David Leung, Lecturer in the Queen Margaret Business School, said: “The MSc is perfect for those graduates who want an accelerated route to chartered status. It’s not only designed for graduates who already have a background in accounting and finance and who wish to progress their career, the programme is also for those graduates who want to change career – making the move from a general manager to a finance director, for example.</p>
<p>“Our MSc is one of only a few programmes in the UK that offer students the opportunity to obtain a Master’s qualification, the CIMA Advanced Diploma, and the 11 exemptions from CIMA’s professional exams. Students will also benefit from being taught by CIMA qualified accountants with relevant industry experience.</p>
<p>“For those who don’t wish to commit to undertaking a full Master’s programme, there is the option to study towards at PgDip, PgCert or even individual modules as part of continued professional development.”</p>
<p>Dr Leung added: “Students will be studying in one of the most stunning and desirable cities in the world. Edinburgh is not only one of the best cities to study and live in, it’s also home to the UK’s second largest financial centre, meaning that career opportunities are right on the doorstep!”</p>
