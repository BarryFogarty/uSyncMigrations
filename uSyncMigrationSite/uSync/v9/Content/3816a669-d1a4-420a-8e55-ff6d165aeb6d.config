<p>The participatory assessment tool for mapping social connections is an approach developed by Queen Margaret University (QMU), which employs participatory activities to explore the various types and qualities of social resources that avail themselves to the participant group. The methodology uses hypothetical real life problems to explore connections associated with ‘bridging’, ‘linking’ and bonding (trust) social capital (Putnam 2000; Granovetter 1973; Szreter and Woolcock 2004) and relational properties such as frequency and reciprocity (Torche and Valanzuela, 2011). The methodology also invites participants to identify geographically where they would most likely find these resources (at the household, neighbourhood, city, country or global level), in this way coproducing data that remains sensitive to the situatedness and specificity of communities or subcultures.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>A second stage of the methodology uses the generated connections to develop measures of connectedness and trust for individual participants, as well as trust scores for those actors identified as resources by the participant group. The participatory research design and approach of the tool mean that not only does it enable us to collect information, but could also provide participants with information and support directly relevant to them.</p>
<p>The tool has been tested in different settings, ranging from refugees in Glasgow to internally displaced people in Kurdistan and has proven not only applicable to different contexts (after accurate tailoring), but also valuable in guiding NGOs in developing appropriate support mechanisms for the populations studied.</p>
<p>An app is currently under development that should enable researchers to conduct activities two and three (see below) electronically and will facilitate both data collection across geographically disparate population, and the analysis of the resultant data.</p>

The research team, supported by interpreters and advisory board, can then rationalise and reduce the list to between 25 and 35 people and organisations by streamlining terminology, combining very similar items and excluding items mentioned by only one person. Each item on the list is given a number and the researchers make a set of 35 small cards – each card with one of the items written on it.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Activity 2: Individual interview / card sorting exercise (20 – 40 minutes per interview)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Can be done one the same day as Activity 1 or after a few days</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Participants are reminded that participation is voluntary, that they are free to stop the interview at any time and asked to reiterate verbal consent.</li>\n<li>Participants are asked to think about the past six months, and can be helped to identify the six month time period accurately by remembering a particular local event.</li>\n<li>Once the researcher is confident that the participant is clear about the time period, they can introduce the first card sort task:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em>Question 1: Have you spoken to, or asked this person or organisation for help in the last six months?</em></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<p>Participants are shown each card in turn, the name on the card is read out loud and the participant is asked to indicate their answer by putting the card on a pile for ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The cards are brought back into one pile, and the researcher proceeds to question two.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em>Question 2: How much do you trust this person or organisation: A lot, a little, or not at all?</em></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<p>Participants are shown three cards with simple drawings of cups to represent the three responses: A lot – cup full; a little – cup half full; empty cup.

A template diagram can be completed during each workshop with participants – see above.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Based on the results of Activity 2 (card sorting exercise), Q1 further information can be added on the level of connectedness of the participants to each of the people/organizations listed. This analysis proceeds as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The recording sheet is entered in Excel and, for each person/organization, the number of times it has been mentioned is counted (number of connections);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The level of connection can be calculated by dividing the number of connections by the total number of responses received for that particular person/organization (excluding N/As or no replies);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using the Pivot Table function in Excel, answers can be further disaggregated by gender, age, type of community or any other variable that could be of interest for the study (which must be included in the entered data set for each individual);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>People and organisations can also be grouped into larger categories, such as family, community, government, NGOs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Similarly, based on the second/third question, the level of trust in each person/organization can be calculated in general (Q2) and with reference to the specific problem scenario (Q3). This is done by calculating the average score obtained by each person/organization in terms of trust. The level of trust can also be turned into a percentage where the maximum score of 2 corresponds to 100%. Again, the results can be disaggregated by individual variables and people/organizations can be grouped in homogenous categories.</p>\n<p>The forthcoming availability of a web-based app, whereby responses to questions two and three can be entered electronically by researchers or directly by participants should enable the analysis above to be done automatically, and will generate the maps, as well as allowing for the downloading of excel set with raw data.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
