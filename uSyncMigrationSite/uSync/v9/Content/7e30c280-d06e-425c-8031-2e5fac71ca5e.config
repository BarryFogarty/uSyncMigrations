      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The sessions are run by The Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation at QMU’s campus in Musselburgh. The Centre assesses both new items before they are launched, as well as existing products already on the market. </p>
<p>Panel members will have the opportunity to taste different food and drink products and share their opinions on a wide range of goods including bakery items, meats, ready meals, cakes, snacks and chocolate. John Lewis and Amazon vouchers are given out as rewards for participating, so panel members can use the opportunity to save money for summertime.</p>
<p>Attendance on the panel would suit people aged 18 years and upwards who can take part in occasional panels mainly during week days. Panellists will be rewarded after each tasting session with a gift voucher of either £10 or £20 depending on the length of the session.</p>
<p>Sessions run throughout the year, but QMU is looking to increase its number of participants to service a large scale project during the week commencing the 18<sup>th</sup> March 2019. Both daytime and evening sessions will be running during that week.</p>
<p>Catriona Liddle from the Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation, explained: “Participants taking part in the March sessions will have the opportunity to taste a variety of sweet and savoury products which are already on the market. We will be asking panellists to review each product against a competitor product. Panellists are often surprised how their views of products they buy regularly change once they are asked to consider the products’ attributes in more detail. Panellists also find the sessions are a great way to save for holidays and Christmas.”</p>
<p>No previous experience is necessary to take part in the sessions, but all participants should be over 18 and should not have any dietary restrictions.</p>
<p>Panellists can choose to apply for as many sessions as they wish, but there is no obligation to attend every session that is being promoted.  Each week our list of consumer panellists will receive an email with notification of upcoming sessions to choose from.  If you would like to find out more information, or to sign up as a consumer panel taster, please email Lucy MacLellan of QMU Food &amp; Drink Consumer Tasting Panel on E: <a href="mailto:consumerpanels@qmu.ac.uk"><strong>consumerpanels@qmu.ac.uk </strong></a></p>]]></Value>
