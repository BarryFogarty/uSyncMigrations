      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study at QMU, and what attracted you to the course?</span></p>
<p>I knew I wanted to study in Edinburgh, and at the time, I was teetering between focusing on either theatre or film but couldn't quite figure out what I was more drawn to. So, with this course focused on both subjects, and at a university situated not far from the city centre - the BA (Hons) Theatre and Film ticked all the boxes for me!</p>
<p><span class="lead">What did you enjoy most about your course?  </span></p>
<p>The wide range of modules available for us to choose from each semester.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Were there any particular course activities you found especially interesting?</span></p>
<p>Film production and screenwriting; both modules allowed you to be super creative and helped us gain and develop these vital skills for a career within the industry.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How did your lecturers support your learning?</span></p>
<p>They were wonderful! The lecturers at QMU are so supportive and warm. I found them very approachable, which made the whole university experience far smoother and more enjoyable.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></p>
<p>Go for it! If you, like I was, know that you want to work in the creative arts but still can't quite decide which area you want to focus on – this is the course for you. QMU's Theatre and Film degree truly allows you to try a bit of everything whilst focusing on what areas you want to specialise in at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What's your 'top tip' for making the most of being a student?</span></p>
<p>There's no right way to 'do' uni life; experience it how you want to experience it, BUT do use and abuse those student discounts while you can!! You'll miss them when they're gone!</p>
<p><span class="lead">What was the most valuable lesson that you learned at university?</span></p>
<p>How to be more independent and also how to adapt to new and sometimes uncomfortable situations. </p>
<p><span class="lead">Can you tell us about your life post-graduation?</span></p>
<p>I entered the short documentary I made for my dissertation into film festivals across the world and managed to bag quite a few wins. STV also interviewed me about my experience of filming my documentary in Chernobyl, and I now work as a freelance filmmaker alongside my best friend.</p>]]></Value>
