      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span>Simon Hoult, Associate Head of Psychology, Sociology and Education at Queen Margaret University, explained: “This degree follows on from the success of QMU’s other teaching qualifications – a degree in primary education and a postgraduate diploma in home economics.”</span> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="In our modern world with all its local, national, and global challenges, there has never been a more important time to learn the necessary skills and knowledge to help transform young lives. It is essential that we educate young people to contribute positively to their communities, as well as to global wellbeing. Queen Margaret University’s new PGDE Secondary (Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies) will help develop a new generation of Religious Education teachers who can advocate for social justice, sustainable lifestyles and health and wellbeing, and enable young people to grapple with moral and ethical issues, equipping them to face the challenges of 21st century citizenship." source="Simon Hoult, Associate Head of Psychology, Sociology and Education at Queen Margaret University" sourceExtra="" />
<p><span>Queen Margaret University has a team of highly experienced teacher educators on this course whose work is steeped in the theme of social justice, which is a core value running through all of Queen Margaret University’s work. </span> </p>
<p><span>Discussing the benefits of the new postgraduate teaching degree, Simon confirmed: “One of the great features of this course is that successful graduates have guaranteed secure paid employment for one year in a secondary school in Scotland as a RMPS teacher.</span> </p>
<p><span>“The University’s teaching degrees are very focused on outdoor learning as a fun and engaging way to educate young people. Students on the </span><span>PGDE Secondary (Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies) will have plenty of opportunity to develop their outdoor learning skills within the attractive grounds of Queen Margaret University. As the year progresses, the University will be further developing its Outdoor Learning Hub to support the education of all of its teaching students, and that of the wider teaching profession.” </span> </p>
<p><span>Sir Paul Grice, Principal of Queen Margaret University, concluded: “Our initial teacher education courses take a fresh and vibrant approach to learning to teach in Scotland. Our strong focus on social justice allows us to attract and educate people who want to make a real difference to the world around them. What better way to do that than to educate and inspire our future generation of young people – supporting them to develop as engaged global citizens who can make a positive contribution to shaping our communities and the health of our nation.”</span> </p>
