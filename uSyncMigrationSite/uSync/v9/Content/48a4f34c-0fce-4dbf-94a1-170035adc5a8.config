      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Findings in the report draw on the transformative experiences of students enrolled in the groundbreaking Enhanced Learning Tutoring Initiative (ELTI), the largest project of its kind in Scotland.</p>
<p>Established in 2020 by QMU’s Widening Participation and Outreach Team and funded by STV Children's Appeal and local partners including Midlothian and East Lothian councils, ELTI offered new hope for young learners facing socio-economic hurdles.</p>
<p>During the peak of the pandemic, research from mentoring organisation MCR Pathways indicated that the closure of schools was exacerbating the poverty-related attainment gap in Scotland.</p>
<p><img src="?mode=crop&amp;width=800&amp;height=400" alt="QMU tutoring " width="800" height="400" data-udi="umb://media/452832def0a442c5851c79e6e6f6abf9"></p>
<p>Disadvantaged and care-experienced young people had fewer educational resources at home, less access to private tuition than their wealthier counterparts, and increased stress and anxiety levels.</p>
<p>The ELTI programme targeted high school students working towards National 4, National 5, or Higher qualifications. The aim was to empower these students to reach their academic potential by offering high-quality tutoring sessions and fostering positive, nurturing relationships. As a time-limited funded programme, it was designed as a pilot to prove the value of such tutoring.</p>
<p>MCR Pathways research also showed that <strong>68%</strong> of Scotland's most underprivileged young individuals reported doing no schoolwork during lockdown. Almost half of them perceived the materials as too challenging, <strong>43%</strong> cited stress and anxiety as major obstacles to their learning and one in four had caregiving responsibilities that hampered their ability to engage in remote learning.</p>
<p>The evaluation report reveals a boost in students' confidence levels and that, in a supportive tutoring environment, they feel more at ease making mistakes and posing questions they might shy away from in a traditional classroom setting.</p>
<p>Academically, 70% maintained or improved their predicted exam performance as a result of participating in ELTI. The unhurried atmosphere of tutoring was appreciated by students, with over 80% expressing a willingness to participate in tutoring again. Beyond individual advantages, tutoring has a ripple effect in the classroom, reducing the demand on teachers' time while fostering a peer-to-peer support system.</p>
<p>The Head of the STV Children’s Appeal, Natalie Wright, said: “Helping young people to achieve is the foundation of the STV Children’s Appeal, so we were delighted to support ELTI – a creative solution to the educational inequalities that impact some young people’s potential to thrive.</p>
<p>“We welcome this report, which shows ELTI has been a transformative project, enabling those involved to improve their quality of learning, increase their confidence and enhance future life prospects, whilst also empowering young adult tutors. It’s extremely rewarding to see that a project that we’ve supported has had such a positive, life-changing impact.”</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="As the academic community grapples with the long-term repercussions of the pandemic, ELTI has shown the transformative power of targeted interventions. Investment in 121 and small group tutoring to those in need can lay the foundation for a more equitable and inclusive future. ELTI&#x27;s success story serves as an inspiring model for other institutions to follow, demonstrating the value of tutoring in building a resilient and equitable education system for all." source="Sir Paul Grice" sourceExtra="Principal and Vice-Chancellor of QMU " />
<p>The Newbattle High School Deputy Headteacher, Jim Fair, said: “The nurturing ethos of the ELTI tutors provided a personalised approach to each session. Without a doubt, the opportunity to work in small groups with the focus on consolidating students' understanding of exam content and supplementing the skills developed in class has shown to increase the confidence of our students.</p>
<p>"The initiative supported students through encouraging a positive attitude towards independent study in preparation for examinations and assessments. Key feedback from students is that the ELTI 'tutors really want us to pass our exams’.”</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="ELTI has developed from its initial ‘emergency response’ to the Covid-related school closures and the impact these had on education. The longer-term impact of Covid on learning and engagement in education is still being felt and the need for extra support for some of our more vulnerable young people is as great as ever. School attendance is at an all-time low and ELTI has shown that tutoring can work as a tool to help re-engage young people in education, encouraging them back into school and back towards positive destinations. Having developed the programme over the four years it has run, we now have delivered an effective working model which can be shared and adopted by others to enable delivery of an equitable provision of tutoring across Scotland." source="Lisa Vettese Cruden" sourceExtra="ELTI Project Lead" />]]></Value>
