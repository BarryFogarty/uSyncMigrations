<p>Fees for our <strong>Undergraduate </strong>courses are set outbelow.  The  course fee is dependent on the course type and the category of student (i.e Home, RUK, EU or International).Where the term RUK (Rest of UK) is used in the sections below, this means England, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland - including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>If you are a first degree student and ordinarily resident in Scotland, you may be eligible for your tuition fees to be paid by the Scottish Government by applying to the Student Awards Agency Scotland (<a href="http://www.saas.gov.uk/" title="SAAS">SAAS</a>).</p>
<p>If you are a non-British EU student, the Scottish Government has announced that if you are commencing your studies in 2019 your fees will continue to be paid for you for the duration of your course.

    "content": "<p><strong>Supporting students in financial need – reminder and additional information</strong></p>\n<p>The Senior Leadership Team has been thinking very carefully about how best to support students facing financial difficulties arising out of the current situation, and how to do so fairly based on need. We will be arranging for a significant increase in our international hardship funds in addition to the existing discretionary funds for UK students. We invite students in need to apply for such funding. If you are facing financial hardship then please contact the Student Funding Adviser at <strong>studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk</strong>. The Student Funding Adviser can provide you with advice as well as guidance on how to apply for our hardship and discretionary funds.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, we will be sympathetic to requests from students who are experiencing financial hardship and who wish to extend their tuition fee or accommodation payment terms, so that they can pay their outstanding balance over a longer period of time than originally planned.  Students who are experiencing hardship and in need of such payment extensions should contact <a href=\"mailto:creditcontroller@qmu.ac.uk\">creditcontroller@qmu.ac.uk</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>LATE PAYMENTS</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Unless you have chosen to pay by instalments, if your tuition fee remains unpaid 21 days after it is due, you may become liable to pay interest at 2.5% above the UK clearing bank base rate per annum on the full amount. Interest will run from the due date until the outstanding fees are eventually paid.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you have chosen to pay by instalments, interest on a late instalment will run from the due date to the date when the instalment is paid.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong>DIFFICULTIES IN MAKING A PAYMENT</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you are experiencing difficulty in paying all or part of your tuition fees, you must contact the <a href=\"mailto:creditcontroller@qmu.ac.uk\">Credit Controller</a> as soon as possible. The Credit Controller will help you to draw up a payment schedule, to which you will be required to adhere until your fees are paid in full.</p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENT TO LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">Unless you have agreed a payment schedule with the Credit Controller, if tuition fees are still outstanding 8 weeks after the end of the 21-day period or if an instalment is over 4 weeks late, you may be asked to leave the University. The University will put your debt into the hands of a debt collector.</p>\n<p class=\"txtHeadings\"><strong>REINSTATEMENT ON PAYMENT OF FULL TUITION FEES </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">On payment in full of outstanding tuition fees before the end of the academic year in question, the University may permit your reinstatement on your programme of study. However, if you are behind with your studies you may have to repeat parts of the programme, thereby incurring further fees.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">PROGRESSION</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">You will not be permitted to progress to the next year of your course if you have any debts due to the University from previous years.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">DEGREE CEREMONY </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">The University may refuse to allow you to attend a degree ceremony if tuition fees are outstanding.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">APPEAL PROCESS</strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you are unhappy about a decision concerning payment of your fees, including a requirement that you withdraw from the University, you may contact the <a href=\"mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk\">Student Funding Adviser</a>, and bring a complaint under the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/2daf2cbf61f14b3da20fdeaa950818f4}\" title=\"Complaints Procedure\">University’s Student Complaint Procedure</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">EARLY WITHDRAWAL </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you leave your programme of study early, you must ensure that you inform your Head of Subject and the <a href=\"mailto:registry@qmu.ac.uk\">Registry</a> department. The date of withdrawal will be deemed to be the date that the Registry department receives written confirmation of withdrawal. You will be liable for all or part of the fee for the full academic year as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you leave within 28 days of the start of your programme of study, you will be liable for an administration fee of £250.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you leave more than 28 days after the start of your programme of study, you will be liable for the appropriate proportion of the fee based on the semesters attended wholly or in part.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you are making payment of fees by instalments and withdraw from your programme of study, you must still meet any shortfall between the full fee determined by the University and the total amount of the instalments already paid.</p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\"><strong class=\"txtHeadings\">IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP </strong></p>\n<p class=\"txtMainBlack\">If you are experiencing financial difficulties in paying tuition fees you should seek help at the earliest possible opportunity. The University will be sympathetic and assist where it can. However, in order to maintain the quality of teaching for everyone else, the University must act to recover debts. Initially you should approach Bill Stronach, the <a data-id=\"1642\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/ad8fc076737d4365941e1ad4c0445c77}\" title=\"Student Funding Service\">Student Funding Adviser </a>within Student Services for a confidential discussion.

      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Supporting students in financial need – reminder and additional information</strong></p>
<p>The Senior Leadership Team has been thinking very carefully about how best to support students facing financial difficulties arising out of the current situation, and how to do so fairly based on need. We will be arranging for a significant increase in our international hardship funds in addition to the existing discretionary funds for UK students. We invite students in need to apply for such funding. If you are facing financial hardship then please contact the Student Funding Adviser at <a rel="noopener" href="mailto:studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk" target="_blank" title="Email Student Funding">studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk</a>. The Student Funding Adviser can provide you with advice as well as guidance on how to apply for our hardship and discretionary funds.</p>]]></Value>
