<ul>
<li>QMU offers the only accredited Sports Rehabilitation degree in Scotland. The new BSc (Hons) Sports Rehabilitation is delivered in partnership with Edinburgh College or City of Glasgow College and provides the training needed to become a graduate sports rehabilitator.</li>
<li>A QMU physiotherapy lecturer has been running a walking football club which encourages older men from the local community to stay active by playing a gentle sport with younger male students from QMU.</li>
<li>Fifteen sports clubs are currently running at QMU, ranging from cheerleading to volleyball, and from<br />badminton to hockey. Clubs are entirely student led, and if a club doesn’t exist, the Students’ Union<br />will support students to set up a new club of their choice.</li>
<li>Eight-hundred and sixty-eight students are members of a sports club or society at QMU (sports has 539 members).</li>
<li>Last year, our women’s basketball team made history for its QMU team by making it into the finals of the Scottish Conference Cup.</li>
<li>QMU students compete at a national level in a variety of sporting events, from sailing competitions, and climbing nationals to powerlifting championships. Students who wish to compete in individual sporting events can apply to the Students’ Union’s Individual Athletes and Representative Sport Fund for funding.</li>
<li>Both our men's and women's Gaelic football teams have gone undefeated over the last season.</li>
<li>Many of our sports teams compete in British University and College Sport (BUCS). They travel the length and breadth of the country representing QMU and competing against other university teams in a league.</li>
<li>Our Lydia Osteoporosis Project aims to radically improve knowledge and understanding of osteoporosis amongst healthcare professionals and the general public. The main message that came out of the project’s recent osteoporosis awareness conference at QMU was ‘keep moving’.</li>
<li>The QMU Sapphires Cheerleading team will host its 10th annual showcase on campus this year. Teams<br />from all over the country will go head-to-head in front of a panel of professional judges. Last year, the Sapphires took second place in their division.</li>
