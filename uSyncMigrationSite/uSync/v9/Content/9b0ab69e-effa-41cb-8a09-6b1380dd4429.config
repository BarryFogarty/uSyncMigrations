<p><span class="lead">While some may not be immediately drawn to podiatry as a career </span><br /><span class="lead">path, it has proven to be an extremely rewarding and flexible career </span><br /><span class="lead">which can take you almost anywhere in the UK and beyond. </span></p>
<p><strong>A SIDE FROM the ability to transform patients’ lives, one of the great things about the profession is the incredible choice that podiatrists have to carve out their own career path. Podiatrists can choose to work as an NHS employee in a hospital or community setting, run their own private practice, work from home, become a self-employed locum in private practice, or as a lecturer or researcher in a university. With the flexibility to work full-time or part-time, often without the need for night shifts or emergency call outs, a podiatrist can often create a role which works around personal commitments and fits with their career ambitions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, where can a podiatry career take you? Six of our graduates and lecturers <br />give us an insight into their journeys.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>From the Scottish islands to lecturer in the capital</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>WITH A DEGREE in podiatry you can choose to work almost anywhere – from a role working in an inner city to a peripatetic position working across the Scottish islands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joseph McIntyre</strong> has held several positions with the NHS in Scotland. He worked as a podiatrist with Greater Glasgow and Clyde, before moving to the Shetland islands to experience life as a podiatry specialist. He has also experienced working as an advanced <br />podiatrist in rheumatology with NHS Ayrshire and Arran, and as lead podiatrist in orthopedics with NHS Lothian.</p>
<p>With such a well-rounded background, Joseph now leads the Master of Podiatry (MPod) at Queen Margaret University. Not one to stand still, he’s currently juggling his lecturer commitments with studying towards his doctorate!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead">From a care background to a health professional in the NHS</span></p>
<p><strong>COMING FROM a care experienced background, </strong><strong>Daniel Pauley found that </strong><br /><strong>no-one had any ambitions for him </strong><strong>– he was just a kid from care. But </strong><strong>he found his place at QMU and had </strong><strong>a transformative experience during </strong><strong>his degree.</strong></p>
<p>With fantastic support from the University’s podiatry department, he excelled during his BSc (Hons) Podiatry, graduating with a first. He said: “QMU believed in me, so I started to believe in myself.”</p>
<p>Daniel now has a job he loves - working as a podiatrist with NHS Lothian. Within that role he is a practice educator for current QMU students, and he has just been promoted within Lothian to a Band 6 position.</p>
<p>He continues his connection with QMU through the volunteering work he does with Senior Lecturer in Podiatry, Evelyn Weir. Both Daniel and Evelyn have provided specialist foot care for homeless people in Edinburgh, on and off the street, and continue to do so <br />where possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead">From volunteering in refugee camps to working as a diabetes specialist</span></p>
<p><strong>WHILST STUDYING PODIATRY at QMU, Christine McSweeney volunteered to work in refugee camps across Europe providing foot care to those in need. It was this exposure that led her to develop an interest in wound management. She then completed an MSc Diabetes.</strong></p>
<p>Having worked in both private practice and NHS, Christine now lives and works in Cork as a diabetes specialist podiatrist for Diabetes Ireland.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead">Running a private practice in Fife</span></p>
<p><strong>PAUL SHARPLES set up his own podiatry business immediately after graduating from QMU. His private clinic runs from the health club </strong><strong>at the beautiful Keavil House Hotel in Crossford, Fife. He also provides home visits in the Dunfermline area.</strong></p>
<p>Paul focuses on a holistic approach to podiatry care, taking account of medical history, lifestyle and footwear. His all-inclusive approach involves making sure his patient is fully involved in their individual care plan.</p>
<p>He said: “The most enjoyable part of being a podiatrist is watching someone who walked in with severe pain, walking out pain-free with a smile from ear to ear!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead">Improving foot care in the </span><span class="lead">Middle East</span></p>
<p><strong>ANDREW GILMOUR, QMU </strong><strong>graduate, works as a podiatrist in </strong><strong>Kuwait where he provides lower </strong><strong>limb education and foot screening, as </strong><strong>well as ensuring there are diabetes </strong><strong>policies and pathways set up for GPs, </strong><strong>medics and nurses.</strong></p>
<p>He trains doctors and nurses on specialist equipment that detects any vascular abnormalities in the lower limb, as well as liaising with vascular consultants to try and <br />improve foot care in the Middle East.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="lead">A career in surgery</span></p>
<p><strong>ASURGICAL PODIATRIST deals with the surgical management of the bones, joints and soft tissues of the foot and associated structures.</strong></p>
<p>William McMurrich was keen to develop his podiatric career in surgery, so he studied <br />the MSc Theory of Podiatric Surgery delivered jointly by QMU and Glasgow Caledonian <br />University, followed by the podiatric surgical training programme delivered by QMU and <br />NHS Education for Scotland.<br />Surgical podiatrists work with vascular consultants, diabetologists, orthopaedic surgeons and other members of multidisciplinary teams to ensure each patient receives the best clinical outcomes.<br />William now works as a surgical podiatrist for NHS Tayside. He says the most exciting <br />and rewarding part of his job is working in a team to have a positive impact on his patients by correcting painful foot deformities and removing pain.</p>]]></Value>
