      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Penny Martin from NatureScot kicked off the day, welcoming familiar and new faces. The<br />group had last met in 2018, very much pre-pandemic and a lot has changed since then. She<br />described the opportunities afforded by the changing policy landscape, recent Scottish<br />curriculum review and the Learning for Sustainability Action Plan update both have the<br />potential to impact outdoor provision for young people in Scotland. Penny also described<br />some recent research funded by NatureScot, which highlights the existing challenges in<br />achieving consistent outdoor provision. The priority for the day, however, was to connect,<br />reflect, and explore the outdoor spaces provided by QMU.</p>
<p>Following this, Patrick Boxall from QMU described the strategy behind the QMU Outdoor<br />Learning Hub, a series of purpose-built outdoor spaces surrounding the new campus<br />building, intended to provide opportunities for teaching, learning and communities to<br />connect with nature. The spaces include a wee forest, pond, allotment area, wildflower<br />meadow and a gathering place or ‘roundhouse’, all connected by accessible paths and<br />interspersed with areas to sit, pause, observe and reflect. A partnership with Architecture &amp;<br />Design Scotland, NatureScot and others has made this ambitious outdoor project possible<br />and we had the opportunity to explore and respond to it throughout the day.</p>
<p><br />The two main sessions of the day were ‘Getting (re)Acquainted’ and a walking trail around<br />the QMU Outdoors. In ‘Getting (re)Acquainted’, Claire Ramjan facilitated introductions, a<br />sort-of ‘speed dating’ for outdoor researchers and practitioners, along with some reflections<br />on current engagement with research and future hopes. Key outcomes from these sessions<br />were that there is a need for researcher and practitioners to be much more closely<br />connected in order to support and strengthen each other’s practice. Difficulties in accessing<br />contemporary research were also highlighted, with time, cost and accessibility of language<br />all posing challenges. You can find some of the discussions that were recorded on this<br /><a href="https://queenmargaret1.padlet.org/pboxall1/scottish-outdoor-learning-research-picnic-2023-fbkxg5c0lbl3pp1e">Padlet.</a></p>
<p>In the walking trail, Patrick posed the provocation, ‘What are the gifts of place?’, asking<br />participants to explore, reflect and record their experiences in response to the QMU<br />Outdoors. The gifts of sensory experiences, wildlife diversity, dandelions, cowslips and<br />moorhens were all identified by those walking around the site. Questions were also posed<br />by the nature of the place, for example; how do we balance safety and adventure when<br />outdoors? Some wonderful images and further responses can be found in this <a href="https://queenmargaret1.padlet.org/pboxall1/scottish-outdoor-learning-research-picnic-2023-fbkxg5c0lbl3pp1e">Padlet</a>.</p>
<p>Both Padlets will remain live and interactive, please continue to add any thoughts, ideas or<br />images to them.</p>
<p>Finally, Greg Mannion from the University of Stirling hosted an informal panel discussion to<br />round off our day. A huge thank you to Roger Scrutton, Loren Miller, Carolyn MacFarlane,<br />John Quay, Juliet Robertson and Mairi Ferris for agreeing to sit ‘up front’ and respond to the<br />questions arising from the day’s discussions. Firstly, the question of how to better connect<br />researchers and practitioners. Loren suggested that embedding researchers directly within<br />delivering organisations is a way to ensure that research that meets the needs of those on<br />the ground is undertaken, and that practitioners can more quickly access and respond to<br />research findings. Juliet passionately reminded us to celebrate successes, whether that is<br />early years practitioners taking children outdoors in all weathers, or peer conversations<br />promoting outdoor experiences in schools. By recognising and celebrating these small wins,<br />we fortify our commitment to a positive relationship with nature for our young people.<br />Finally, a reflection on the importance of professional learning opportunities and time to<br />implement outdoor approaches consistently in practice was made (by Heidi Smith,<br />University of Edinburgh), further emphasising the need for a strengthened relationship<br />going forward.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone that came along for participating so enthusiastically in the<br />day. Many great conversations were started, we hope to continue them into the future.</p>]]></Value>
