      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead">What are your most memorable experiences of being a QMUC student?</span></p>
<p>I just remember having this wonderful, exciting feeling of being part of a drama school in my hometown, and how lucky I felt to have lecturers and our Head of School, Maggie Kinloch, really push and inspire us to experiment, create, develop and explore. </p>
<p>Some of the best experiences include project based work with my peers from the Acting and Stage Management courses. I really got to hone my skills in directing for theatre.</p>
<p>Another brilliant memory is going to an international student festival in Amsterdam. It gave us the opportunity to meet other international artists and bring back that knowledge and experience, and apply it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. </p>
<p>Student life was never boring. And, between training and the Students' Union you knew you were part of a community. <br /><br /><span class="lead">Tell us more about your career path since leaving QMU.  </span></p>
<p>I knew that I wanted to become a drama teacher so I selected the Community Theatre specialism in my third and fourth year. After I graduated, I went to study at Edinburgh University to obtain my PGCE in secondary education.</p>
<p>Alongside this, I ran my own theatre company for a while called ‘random ACT’. We successfully staged a number of productions including one that got nominated for an award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.  </p>
<p>I’ve established two school drama departments in Scotland and am now a Depute Head teacher.</p>
<p>When I was teaching at Edinburgh College, I was so lucky to come back to QMU as a lecturer on the Creative Industries Academies initiative, working in the new campus in Musselburgh. </p>
<p>I’ve had many students go to QMU to study performing arts courses. I am very proud of them all and feel happy at knowing the training they are receiving will set them on an exciting chapter for whatever career path they choose.  </p>
<p><span class="lead">Tell us more about what your current role involves.</span></p>
<p>My current job is very much about school and educational leadership. The skills I learned as a drama student are so important to me; communication, creativity, team work.</p>
<p>QMUC taught me to be my authentic self and I have always carried that with me throughout my career. </p>
<p>I was part of the working group that implemented LGBT inclusive education across the curriculum, making Scotland the first country in the world to do so. Working with the Scottish Government as part of the Time for Inclusive Education campaign and saying I came from QMUC was an amazing feeling.  </p>
<p>I became the first teacher in Scotland to be awarded professional recognition in Equality and Diversity in Education by the General Teaching Council for Scotland. And in 2021, I was named Educator of the Year at the National Proud Scotland Awards. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What advice would you give to students and new graduates starting out?</span></p>
<p>Take each project, challenge, opportunity you are given to learn from it.</p>
<p>Know you are part of an incredible community of artists that are making a huge difference to the world and society we are in. </p>
<p>And, always be your authentic self. </p>]]></Value>
