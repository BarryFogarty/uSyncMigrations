    "content": "<p><strong>Not tied to one sector</strong></p>\n<p>This course was designed to address the needs of media and creative industries for people with a broad knowledge of the economic, cultural significance of those industries - not tied to one specific sector but with an overview of media and creative worlds as both converging and overlapping. Whilst some fields tend to be nationally focused (journalism, for example), some are global (popular music industries, for example). Other areas are facing the challenges of transitional from a national environment to the transnational (digital media regulation).</p>\n<p><strong>National and international in focus, and reflecting industry developments</strong></p>\n<p>This course covers UK national issues but it is also committed to an international perspective - it engages with current technological and business developments, such as the impact of digital technologies on media industries and the global significance of media platforms. One of the most important issues facing media and creative industries is that of their relationship with governments and other policy makers - the players that shape and regulate the market environment in which media and creative industries operate. You will explore those sometimes difficult areas of interaction and critically consider the forces that rapidly shape markets and industries.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversity of module choice</strong></p>\n<p>On completion of this course you will have both a broad UK national and international understanding of these challenges. You will also have had the opportunity to explore more deeply specific areas of interest drawn from the wide range of elective modules available to you from across QMU's School of Arts, Social Sciences and Management.</p>"
