    "title": "About the course",
    "content": "<p>Mad Studies is an emerging academic discipline that explores the global knowledge that has emerged from the mad movement. This body of knowledge includes the exploration of the dominant understandings of madness. It examines individual and collective experiences of madness. It offers a critique of the mental health service landscape and the cultural and socio political responses experienced by the mad community. It evaluates activist responses and the creation of mad knowledge and action.</p>\n<p>What is central to the philosophy of this MSc Mad Studies programme is the importance of the mad community critiquing the dominant discourses on madness by creating its own discourses, spaces, partnerships, alternatives and organisations. At its analytic core Mad Studies should have mad people, mad issues and mad culture.</p>\n<p>As a student on this programme you will be part of a diverse and intersecting community of learners that include people with lived experience and members of the mad community, public sociology students and professionals from the public and third sector. You will explore the potential impact of Mad Studies in diverse contexts.</p>\n<p>This course offers you the opportunity to engage with diverse public groups and to reflect critically on how Mad Studies can contribute to work for social justice and change. You will study what is distinctive about Mad Studies and Public Sociology and the methods of engagement and research of the disciplines.</p>\n<p>The MSc Mad Studies programme draws on the experiences of Mad Studies scholars and activists throughout the world and involves teaching by academics from a range of disciplines in which Mad Studies is relevant. Lecturers are engaged in research, education and activism with various communities within society.<br />The programme is embedded as an integrated pathway on an existing master’s framework for person-centred practice (PCPF), in partnership with CAPS Independent Advocacy, Occupational Therapy and Public Sociology. The PCP framework offers a person-centred approach to learning, fostered through four processes of engagement: experimentation, collaboration, critical discourse and evidence-informed perspectives. Specifically, the MSc programme aims to ensure the centrality of Mad Studies to facilitate learning at master’s level.</p>"
