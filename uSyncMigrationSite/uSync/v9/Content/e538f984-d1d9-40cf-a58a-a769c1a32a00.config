<p>This guidance sets out the external and internal context for the development of taught postgraduate programmes. It is relevant to the full range of taught postgraduate degrees (with one important exception – see below for details). Types of provision include specialist, multi-disciplinary, pre-registration and post- registration programmes, offering a wide range of choice to students in the type of programmes and the modes of study available.</p>

<p>QMU taught postgraduate programmes follow the modular, credit accumulation approach that is also used at undergraduate level. This provides the necessary flexibility to meet the needs and demands of individual students, while providing a structure which can be easily understood by students, deliverers, and planners of postgraduate programmes of study. The modular structure is important not only for full awards of the University, but also for students who are engaged in Continuing Professional Development (CPD) or lifelong learning within QMU. This means that it is relevant also for the development of M-level micro- credentials, which are self-contained short programmes designed to support skills development and employability.</p>

<p>The majority of awards include subsidiary exit points of Postgraduate Diploma, or Postgraduate Certificate. It is also possible to develop a Postgraduate Certificate or Postgraduate Diploma as an award in its own right.</p>
<p>Modules may be accrued through a named route programme or, in some specific cases, through a more individually designed study route. Study may be full- or part-time depending on the validated programme. A student who does not wish to study for a full award may be able join the University as an Associate Student and complete modules on a stand-alone basis without registering for a specific award. This option is only available where modules are specifically available to be taken on a stand-alone basis.</p>

<div class="column">
<p>The <a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/the-quality-code/characteristics-statements" title="QAA Agency">Quality Assurance Agency’s</a> Characteristics Statement on Master’s Degrees categorises postgraduate awards as follows (copied directly from the Statement; includes references to some awards not currently offered at QMU):</p>
<p><strong>Category 1:</strong> Research Master's degrees: Examples of Research Master's include the MPhil, MLitt and the MRes. Research Master's degrees usually aim to prepare students for the next stage in a research career, whether pursuing a further research programme or entering research-based employment; or to enable those undertaking the course to contribute towards research in the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Category 2:</strong> Specialised or advanced study Master's degrees: Examples of specialised or advanced study Master's include the MSc, the MA, the MBA, the MRes and some integrated Master's.<br />Specialised or advanced study Master's degrees usually aim to prepare students for the next stage in their careers, whether that is further academic or professional study, or entering or progressing within employment of different kinds.</p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Category 3:</strong> Professional or practice Master's degrees: Examples of professional or practice Master's include the MBA, MDiv, LLM and MSW, post experience MAs and MScs and some integrated Master's.<br />Professional or practice Master's degrees usually aim to enable graduates to qualify for entry into a profession, subject to any further conditions required by the PSRB; or to provide development opportunities related to particular professions or employment settings.</p>
<p>Integrated Master's degrees6: Integrated Master's degrees are delivered through a course that combines study at the level of a bachelor's degree with honours with study at Master's level during the latter stages of the course. As such, a student usually graduates with a Master's degree after a continuous course of study.</p>
<p>Integrated Master's degree courses typically include study equivalent to at least one full-time academic year at level 11 in Scotland (for example, at Master's level).</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Within the <a href="https://scqf.org.uk" title="SQA website">Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework</a>, there are two parameters that determine qualifications: level of learning outcomes and volume of outcomes, calculated as number of credits. SCQF Level 11 includes a number of qualifications that differ only in the volume of credit, not in level of outcomes. The taught awards of Queen Margaret University that are delivered at SCQF Level 11 category are as set out in paragraph 1.2 of this Framework. Credit definitions for each of these qualifications are given in the <a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/the-quality-code/characteristics-statements" title="QAA website">Quality Assurance Agency’s Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutions</a> (QAA 2014).</p>
<p>Standards of awards will be determined by the demand made on students and their response to that demand. Standards will be benchmarked against the appropriate external reference points such as expectations of professional bodies and standards of similar awards in other universities as determined by the external examining system.</p>

<p><span class="lead">6 Structure</span></p>
<p><span class="lead">6.1  The module</span></p>
<p>A module is a self-contained part of a programme with separate aims, pre- requisites, content and assessment as defined in the module descriptor. Each module offered is subject to a process of approval and review, which is designed to ensure the module meets the expectations for SCQF level 11, that it has been designed taking account of all relevant internal and external reference points, and that it meets the needs of students and employers. Learning, teaching and assessment methods for each module will vary according to the subject and context. However, all modules require similar student effort and meet the requirements of level 11 of the SCQF.</p>
<p>The building block of the taught postgraduate programmes is the standard module (20 credits), which is defined in terms of study time (approximately 200 hours per 20 credit module). The equivalent of nine 20-credit modules are to be completed to fulfil the requirements of a 180 credit Master’s programme.</p>
<p>Modules can be offered as core or elective units of study. Module viability for electives is determined by the Dean of School in conjunction with the University’s Academic Planning Board. When a module has to be withdrawn at short notice, the affected students will be guided to viable alternatives.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">9.1 Committee management</span></p>
<p>The nature of postgraduate study means that it can be difficult to schedule Programme and Student-Staff Consultative Committee meetings. This particularly, but not exclusively, applies to part-time programmes, where students are often also in full-time employment. In the event that it is not possible to organise a committee meeting in line with the usual practice set out in the Programme Management Regulations, teams are encouraged to take a more flexible approach, whilst observing the minimum requirements.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><span class="lead">10 Learning, Teaching and Assessment</span></p>
<p>In accordance with the University’s Student Experience Strategy, all taught postgraduate programmes will be student-centred. The learning, teaching and <span style="font-size: 14px;">assessment strategies will be designed to enable independent progress within a supportive framework.</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Guided by the principles of constructive alignment, and recognising diversity of learning styles and background, learning will be facilitated and assessed using strategies most appropriate to support achievement of learning outcomes within the discipline.</p>
<p>Constructive alignment is an outcomes-based approach to teaching, in which the learning outcomes that students are intended to achieve are defined before teaching takes place. Teaching and assessment methods are then designed to best achieve those outcomes and to assess the standard at which they have been achieved.</p>
<p>Teaching and assessment strategies will enable students to develop their full potential by recognising and building on prior knowledge and experience and by facilitating development of subject-related knowledge and skills and the QMU Graduate Attributes. Strategies should develop and reward critical, evaluative and enquiry-based approaches to study.</p>
<p>Students should have a broad appreciation of the range of methodologies that are available to researchers, including both quantitative and qualitative modes of inquiry. They should understand the general principles and characteristic practices of those various approaches to research, for example, the theoretical underpinnings, data gathering techniques and forms of data analysis. Students should be able to appreciate the reasons why researchers come to adopt a particular methodology which is appropriate both to their object of study and to the aims of their investigation. They will also benefit from an understanding of the ethical and political issues that can arise in the planning, conduct and presentation of a research project.</p>
<p>Students should be facilitated to develop a deeper working knowledge of the key methodologies that are employed in their chosen subject area or discipline. They should be able to critically evaluate contemporary research developments in that field. Most importantly, students should develop the conceptual and practical skills necessary to carry out independent research in the form of a Master’s dissertation, or other major project, so that they are competent to define a manageable topic of study, decide on appropriate strategies for inquiry, development, analysis and conclusions, and are able to present results in appropriate formats and media.</p>
<p>The Master’s project is amongst the most important learning activities for Master’s students and is therefore usually weighted equivalent to two or three 20- credit modules. Dependent on the award, this significant assessment may be a dissertation, an original and creative work, a work-based study, a portfolio or a professional intervention, but it must include theoretical evaluation and analysis of a high standard equivalent to a piece of empirical research, and must contribute to the development of the subject or profession. Further information is provided in Appendix one.</p>

<p>The general guidelines for Master’s projects are given in Appendix 1. Individual programmes will define the expectations, including timeline within their Definitive Document and student-facing materials.</p>
<p>The achievement of a study of sufficient depth and quality to satisfy the requirements of a Master’s project cannot necessarily be programmed within specific time limits. Whilst students will be encouraged not to delay the process, more importance will be placed on the quality and maturity of their work than the speed with which they achieve it.</p>
<p>Students will typically submit a synopsis of the proposed project for review, the timing of which is to be discussed with the dissertation supervisor, or other nominated staff member. This will allow some preparatory work for a proposal or full outline to commence.</p>
<p>The dissertation supervisor, or the nominated staff member, will provide guidance on other timelines relevant to the discipline and programme. Such timelines will vary according to factors such as mode of study and project format.</p>
<p>Those conducting the assessment of the project will normally be the supervisor and a member of staff appointed as a second independent marker for the project. Projects will be double-blind marked. Full information on marking and moderation can be found in the Assessment Regulations.</p>

It is recognised that a variety of project models are in place across the University, and more specific guidance should be provided in the Definitive Document and other programme specific materials.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">1  Introduction</span></p>\n<p>The project is the culmination of the Master’s programme, successful completion of which allows the student to demonstrate achievement of the overarching programme aims and outcomes. It carries a weight that is normally equivalent to either two (40 credits) or three (60 credits) taught modules and thus represents around either 400 or 600 hours of student effort. In general, the project must reflect sufficient evidence of independent thought to justify the award at Master’s level.</p>\n<p>The subject of the project often aligns with work with which the student is already involved or represents development within a cognate academic discipline. Students may also choose to pursue a subject in an area where they wish to develop experience.</p>\n<p>The project, regardless of its format, must be intellectually demanding and clearly applicable to Master’s level study. The nature and scope of the project must be discussed with relevant academic colleagues, and if appropriate professionals in the field, one of whom may be invited to act as supervisor. Under certain circumstances, students may also wish to consult with their employer.</p>\n<p>The project should be an exposition of the student's own work, ideas and/or contribution. If the work for the project forms part of a group endeavour e.g. within the student’s employing organisation, it is essential that the student's personal contribution is clearly identified and outlined. Students are required to discuss any copyright implications, both with their employer, and relevant academic staff (usually the project supervisor).</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2  The Aims of the Project</span></p>\n<p>The general aims of the project are to:</p>\n<p>a)  Enable students to develop and apply the skills of research and enquiry to produce original work which contributes to a subject, field or profession.</p>\n<p>b)  Engage students in study which demands a professional approach, academic rigour, independence and self-direction</p>\n<p>The specific aims of the project are to enable the student to:</p>\n<p>a) Explore and apply relevant intellectual approaches and practical skills,</p>\n<p>including those acquired in the taught components, to the chosen topic.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>b)  Develop critically, strategically and in depth a topic or area of interest arising from the work undertaken within the taught modules contributing to the programme and in the student's area of academic or professional interest.</p>\n<p>c)  Develop further the research skills as acquired through the taught research modules and/or other research content, to demonstrate an ability to set the project in its wider context, to sustain argument and to present conclusions.</p>\n<p>d) Present and be able to defend their rationale, approach or methodology, outcomes and conclusions.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3 Points to cover in the Definitive Document/student facing materials</span></p>\n<p>When designing a new taught postgraduate programme, it will be important to consider and clearly define within the Definitive Programme Document and student facing materials the following key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student responsibilities</li>\n<li>Programme Leader responsibilities</li>\n<li>Dissertation supervisor (or equivalent) responsibilities</li>\n<li>The process for agreeing the project topic</li>\n<li>The structure and format of the project</li>\n<li>How to present the project</li>\n<li>Arrangements for securing ethical approval</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Marking criteria – the following generic criteria will apply:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Process: Demonstrates appreciation and comprehension of the task planned and undertaken showing initiative and thorough grasp of relevant literature to demonstrate a sound understanding and knowledge. The work should demonstrate competence in the following, as appropriate to the subject: use of new methodologies; apparatus or technique(s), collection and analysis of data and/or statistical applications; use of new technology; creativity and resourcefulness in meeting project objective(s); thoroughness in undertaking of the investigation. Students will also demonstrate originality of thought and/or execution.</p>\n<p>Written submission: Demonstrates thoroughness of review and critical appraisal of past work and use of relevant literature; care in presentation including diagrams if appropriate; clarity and accuracy of prose; organisation of report into logical sequence; choice of style of presentation as shown by clarity of results; intellectual quality of analysis; discussion of results, conclusions and suggestions for further work.</p>\n<p>Oral examination/other components assessed orally (where applicable): Demonstrates complete grasp of the topic; thorough understanding of ethical issues therein; achievement of the objectives; attention to cost and quality if appropriate; presentation and communication skills.</p>\n<p>The presentation and oral examination/other components assessed orally include the demonstration of the results in a project that has an experimental component. For projects that are predominantly theoretical or design oriented, the assessment component for the report may be increased relative to the oral examination components at the discretion of the assessment team. Students <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">should refer to the individual programme handbook/module descriptor for detail of projects of this nature.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Introduction</span></p>\n<p>Integrated Master’s programmes refer to an Undergraduate programme that results in a Master’s qualification. Integrated Master's degrees are delivered through a course that combines study at the level of a Bachelor's degree with study at Master's level during the later stages of the course. As such, a student usually graduates with a Master's degree after a continuous course of study.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2. Credits and levels</span></p>\n<p>In line with Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework requirements, students on Integrated Master's degree courses will typically complete a total of 600 credits, of which at least 120 credits will be at level 11 (at Master’s level). These credits are spread over the duration of the programme (usually four years). For a four-year Integrated Master’s programme, students are required to complete more than the normal 120 SCQF credits in each year. They may also be required to undertake credits at different levels in the same year, for example 120 SCQF level 7 credits and 20 SCQF level 8 credits in year 1.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">3. Progression and exit awards</span></p>\n<p>In line with QMU regulations and the SCQF, there will be a range of exit qualifications, with each award dependent on the number and level of module credits achieved. Details of possible exit qualifications are outlined in QMU Awards regulations. Programmes may also have a final exit award at SCQF level 10 (e.g. BSc Honours). The award classification for a Master’s qualification will be calculated based on the marks gained for Master’s level modules (SCQF 11)</p>\n<p>Considering the demands of the programme in terms of number of credits in a year, as well as the higher level of credits, programmes may set requirements for students to perform at a certain academic level to progress to Master’s level study. For example, a progression point at the end of year 2 where an overall average of 60% is required for progression on the M programme; students who do not meet such requirements will normally continue on the Undergraduate (e.g. BSc Honours) route.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

SEC has a remit to establish and review strategies, policies and procedures that support and enhance the student experience, assure and enhance academic standards and the quality of the student learning experience, and promote best practice in curricula, learning and teaching and in the support of students. The membership of SEC includes academic and professional services colleagues as well as Students’ Union and wider student representation.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the operation of taught postgraduate programmes at QMU sits with Programme Committees and Boards of Examiners. This guidance must be read in conjunction with the wider <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/d5feb49017f1475089ec93d5ab994fe1}" title="Regulations, Policies and Procedures">University regulations</a>, which are available from the Quality website. Full details of committee memberships and remits are also available from the Quality website.
