Just click on that link and it takes you straight to the vote. Each vote is linked to your QMU email so you can only vote once.

This will also prevent \"@qmu.ac.uk\" email addresses being used for personal Apple IDs in future.</p>\n<p><strong>When is it happening?</strong></p>\n<p>We will initiate this process with support from Apple on Tuesday 13th February. The process should be complete within 60 days from then (13<sup>th</sup> April).</p>\n<p><strong>Why is it happening?</strong></p>\n<p>To improve the user experience of Apple devices purchased by QMU, we need staff and students to be able to login to shared devices using a QMU Apple ID which we create and deploy automatically. This work will enable that.</p>\n<p><strong>What is expected of you?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have setup a personal Apple ID using your “@qmu.ac.uk” e-mail address you will receive an e-mail from Apple, and a notification on any relevant Apple devices, advising you of the next steps.</p>\n<p>You will be asked to change the Apple ID to use one of your own personal e-mail addresses, rather than your QMU address.</p>\n<p>Please note, you will not have to change the Apple ID password. Any purchases, content and data made with this Apple ID will not be affected and will remain available to it after you rename the Apple ID.</p>\n<p>After 60 days you will receive a final prompt and your Apple ID will then be automatically renamed. You will receive further instructions direct from Apple.</p>\n<p>Once these conflicts have been resolved, we can then take steps to provision managed Apple IDs using QMU email addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I setup an Apple ID for a work device?</strong></p>\n<p>If your department purchased an Apple device, and you then used your QMU email address to sign up for an Apple ID for it, Apple still classes this as a \"personal\" Apple ID.</p>\n<p>Please contact us as per below in the first instance.</p>\n<p><strong>Further Support</strong></p>\n<p>Please note this process is being driven by Apple, and the QMU Helpdesk will have limited capacity to assist.</p>\n<p>If you have any concerns or questions, please contact <a href=\"mailto:its-comms@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>its-comms@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a></p>\n<p>Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause,</p>\n<p>IT Services</p>\n<p>______________________________________</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">8-week ‘Compassionate Mind Training’ course</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Thursdays, 3.30-5.30pm starting on the 7th March</span></p>\n<p>Do you ever feel that you are your own worst critic?

This will also prevent \"@qmu.ac.uk\" email addresses being used for personal Apple IDs in future.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>When is it happening?</strong></p>\n<p>We will initiate this process with support from Apple on Tuesday 13th February. The process should be complete within 60 days from then (13<sup>th</sup> April).</p>\n<p><strong>Why is it happening?</strong></p>\n<p>To improve the user experience of Apple devices purchased by QMU, we need staff and students to be able to login to shared devices using a QMU Apple ID which we create and deploy automatically. This work will enable that.</p>\n<p><strong>What is expected of you?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have setup a personal Apple ID using your “@qmu.ac.uk” e-mail address you will receive an e-mail from Apple, and a notification on any relevant Apple devices, advising you of the next steps.</p>\n<p>You will be asked to change the Apple ID to use one of your own personal e-mail addresses, rather than your QMU address.</p>\n<p>Please note, you will not have to change the Apple ID password. Any purchases, content and data made with this Apple ID will not be affected and will remain available to it after you rename the Apple ID.</p>\n<p>After 60 days you will receive a final prompt and your Apple ID will then be automatically renamed. You will receive further instructions direct from Apple.</p>\n<p>Once these conflicts have been resolved, we can then take steps to provision managed Apple IDs using QMU email addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I setup an Apple ID for a work device?</strong></p>\n<p>If your department purchased an Apple device, and you then used your QMU email address to sign up for an Apple ID for it, Apple still classes this as a \"personal\" Apple ID.</p>\n<p>Please contact us as per below in the first instance.</p>\n<p><strong>Further Support</strong></p>\n<p>Please note this process is being driven by Apple, and the QMU Helpdesk will have limited capacity to assist.</p>\n<p>If you have any concerns or questions, please contact <a href=\"mailto:its-comms@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>its-comms@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a></p>\n<p>Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause,</p>\n<p>IT Services</p>\n<p>_______________________________________</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Nominations are CLOSING TOMORROW (Thursday 22.2.24 @ 12 Noon) for your Students’ Union Elections!</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hunt is on for which of <strong><u>you</u></strong> will be part of our Officer Committee (OC) for 24/25.

The migration is not happening en masse so some rooms will run the new system while others the old, till the migration is complete. A migrated room will have updated documentation to help with the transition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The changes will better help integrate OneDrive into the systems along with other performance improvements. The main change is the authentication method when logging into a PC. The new system requires the username as <a href=\"mailto:username@qmu.ac.uk\">username@qmu.ac.uk</a> and normal QMU password. You will also need to authenticate using <a href=\"mailto:username@qmu.ac.uk\">username@qmu.ac.uk</a> and standard password when browsing to <a href=\"https://my.qmu.ac.uk\">https://my.qmu.ac.uk</a>  on the devices. The remaining look and feel will stay the same with core functionality not changed either in terms of operating system, applications and media setup of the room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The reason for the change to the new system is to give us greater control and flexibility and adapt to updates/fixes, etc, quicker than the older system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have any questions or queries, then please drop me an email <a href=\"mailto:mglancy@qmu.ac.uk\">mglancy@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Mark Glancy</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Technology Manager</span></p>\n<p>______________________________________</p>\n<p> </p>"

This will also prevent \"@qmu.ac.uk\" email addresses being used for personal Apple IDs in future.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>When is it happening?</strong></p>\n<p>We will initiate this process with support from Apple on Tuesday 13th February. The process should be complete within 60 days from then (13<sup>th</sup> April).</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why is it happening?</strong></p>\n<p>To improve the user experience of Apple devices purchased by QMU, we need staff and students to be able to login to shared devices using a QMU Apple ID which we create and deploy automatically. This work will enable that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What is expected of you?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have setup a personal Apple ID using your “@qmu.ac.uk” e-mail address you will receive an e-mail from Apple, and a notification on any relevant Apple devices, advising you of the next steps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You will be asked to change the Apple ID to use one of your own personal e-mail addresses, rather than your QMU address.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Please note, you will not have to change the Apple ID password. Any purchases, content and data made with this Apple ID will not be affected and will remain available to it after you rename the Apple ID.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After 60 days you will receive a final prompt and your Apple ID will then be automatically renamed. You will receive further instructions direct from Apple.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once these conflicts have been resolved, we can then take steps to provision managed Apple IDs using QMU email addresses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What if I setup an Apple ID for a work device?</strong></p>\n<p>If your department purchased an Apple device, and you then used your QMU email address to sign up for an Apple ID for it, Apple still classes this as a \"personal\" Apple ID.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Please contact us as per below in the first instance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Further Support</strong></p>\n<p>Please note this process is being driven by Apple, and the QMU Helpdesk will have limited capacity to assist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have any concerns or questions, please contact <a href=\"mailto:its-comms@qmu.ac.uk\"><strong>its-comms@qmu.ac.uk</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>_____________________________________________________________________</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Graduation - 1st and 2nd July 2024</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Graduation ceremonies will be held on <strong>Monday 1<sup>st</sup> July and Tuesday 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2024 </strong>at the <strong>Usher Hall, Lothian Road, Edinburgh.</strong> <br /><br />The format of the Graduations will be as follows: </p>\n<p><strong>Monday 1<sup>st</sup> July 2024</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Afternoon Ceremony – 2.30pm  </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Division of Media, Communication &amp; Performing Arts</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Division of Occupational Therapy &amp; Arts Therapies</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Division of Speech &amp; Hearing Sciences</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2024</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Morning Ceremony - 10.30am </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Division of Business, Enterprise and Management</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Division of Dietetics, Nutrition &amp; Biological Science, Podiatry, Physiotherapy and Radiography</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Institute for Global Health &amp; Development</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Afternoon Ceremony – 2.30pm </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Division of Psychology, Sociology and Education</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Division of Nursing &amp; Paramedic Science</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A reception for graduates and their guests will be held on campus from 5pm on each Graduation day. <br /><br />Full Graduation information and booking details will be issued electronically to potential graduates in May 2024.

Here is some information about PALS:</p>\n<p>PALS Sessions are student led learning sessions. They are a relaxed, fun and informal way to give and receive support for learning at QMU. As a PALS leader you will receive training and you will have the opportunity to help your fellow students in the years below you. PALS is an internationally recognised programme, and, as well as being rewarding, being a PALS leader will stand out on your CV as professional development: helping you build leadership skills and transferable skills.</p>\n<p>As a PALS leader, you work with other trained leaders (and a staff coordinator) to design and run supplementary support sessions for students in years below you in modules you have yourself completed. Being a leader is a great opportunity to improve transferable skills, to get to know other students in your division (and across QMU) and to support students in years below you. You would be joining our existing team of fantastic Leaders: you will be trained in designing and facilitating sessions before you start, and you will supported by the PALS coordinator and your PALS-Leader colleagues throughout. It is a volunteering opportunity, so all regular PALS sessions are unpaid, but we usually also have several opportunities for paid work over the course of the year too. It’s also relatively flexible; on average PALS Leaders tend to spend approximately two hours every other week on their PALS work.</p>\n<p>If you would like to find out more about PALS, we have information in the following places:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/study-here/student-services/pals-peer-assisted-learning-at-qmu/\">PALS QMU webpage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i62xtfGAQps\">PALS QMU Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ntWeo4clGH7pASdJmOtvgWrwcI7Ws9ll/view?usp=sharing\">Leader Video</a></li>\n<li>Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/palsqmu/\">palsqmu</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:PALS@qmu.ac.uk\">PALS@qmu.ac.uk</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would be interested in becoming a PALS leader, or finding out what is involved and what you can get out of it, please email <a href=\"mailto:PALS@qmu.ac.uk\">PALS@qmu.ac.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are then still interested in becoming a leader, perhaps you can join our training session this week!</p>\n<p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Jisc online survey changes</span></p>\n<p>Jisc are amending the online portal and migrating to v3 of the platform.

The change does not affect how you access or use Adobe but are back-end changes to the solution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Knowing that most students will be finishing the semester on 08/12/2023, I have asked Adobe to carry out this upgrade in the evening of 19/12/2023. Adobe have advised that the works shouldn’t take too long to complete. But we expect there to be no disruption to logging on at 9am on 20/12/2023.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I have been assured from Adobe that there will be no risk of loss of data currently in the cloud. However, I would like to advise you that keeping an additional copy of any data backed up is always a good idea.

The change does not affect how you access or use Adobe but are back-end changes to the solution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Knowing that most students will be finishing the semester on 08/12/2023, I have asked Adobe to carry out this upgrade in the evening of 19/12/2023.

But we expect there to be no disruption to logging on at 9am on 20/12/2023.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I have been assured from Adobe that there will be no risk of loss of data currently in the cloud. However, I would like to advise you that keeping an additional copy of any data backed up is always a good idea. Especially if it is of importance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the upgrade has taken place, you shouldn’t see any difference in the logging in process.</p>\n<p>Your profile picture of the Adobe account might change.</p>\n<p>We expect the process will only change if a student has used their QMU email address to set up personal access to Adobe software as well as QMU issuing access via that address also.

We hope this will create a sense of belonging for students by connecting them with each other and, hopefully, forging new friendships. We also hope staff who share a love of singing may also be able to attend. We hope that both of these types of connection will contribute to reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness which students can experience when they are away from home.

It was initially set up in 2020/21 as a response to the educational challenges faced by young people due to Covid-19 school closures. Due to the success of the programme, tutoring provision has been continued for a fourth year and delivery has now commenced for academic year 2023/24.</p>\n<p>The programme works with high schools and community organisations in Midlothian and East Lothian, offering weekly tutoring sessions to eligible S4-S6 pupils who are working towards N4, N5 and Higher qualiﬁcations. Tutoring is offered in the full range of SQA subjects. In 2023/24, one-to-one and small group tutoring sessions will take place over two 10-week periods (pre- and post-Christmas). The ﬁrst 10-week block is now coming to an end, but tutoring will continue after the Christmas break for a further 10 weeks, with options for pupils to continue up to their ﬁnal exams. Both in-person and online options will be offered.</p>\n<p><strong>COULD YOU BE ONE OF OUR TUTORS?</strong></p>\n<p>Tutors will have achieved a Higher (or equivalent) in the subject to be tutored and will have either completed a degree, or successfully progressed into the 4th year of an undergraduate degree (not necessarily in the same subject).</p>\n<p>We are currently recruiting tutors for STEM subjects (including Maths, Engineering and Computing Science) at Higher level, to deliver sessions in-person and/or online.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive training programme is provided for tutors. All tutors will be required to attend an in-person training day at QMU in December 2023.

It was initially set up in 2020/21 as a response to the educational challenges faced by young people due to Covid-19 school closures. Due to the success of the programme, tutoring provision has been continued for a fourth year and delivery has now commenced for academic year 2023/24.</p>\n<p>The programme works with high schools and community organisations in Midlothian and East Lothian, offering weekly tutoring sessions to eligible S4-S6 pupils who are working towards N4, N5 and Higher qualiﬁcations. Tutoring is offered in the full range of SQA subjects. In 2023/24, one-to-one and small group tutoring sessions will take place over two 10-week periods (pre- and post-Christmas). The ﬁrst 10-week block is now coming to an end, but tutoring will continue after the Christmas break for a further 10 weeks, with options for pupils to continue up to their ﬁnal exams. Both in-person and online options will be offered.</p>\n<p><strong>COULD YOU BE ONE OF OUR TUTORS?</strong></p>\n<p>Tutors will have achieved a Higher (or equivalent) in the subject to be tutored and will have either completed a degree, or successfully progressed into the 4th year of an undergraduate degree (not necessarily in the same subject).</p>\n<p>We are currently recruiting tutors for STEM subjects (including Maths, Engineering and Computing Science) at Higher level, to deliver sessions in-person and/or online.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive training programme is provided for tutors. All tutors will be required to attend an in-person training day at QMU in December 2023. Tutoring will commence in January 2024.</p>\n<p>Tutors will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>well organised and able to solve problems</li>\n<li>patient and willing to adapt</li>\n<li>able to develop relationships with a diverse group of people</li>\n<li>creative and innovative.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>APPLY NOW</strong></p>\n<p>For informal enquiries and to request an application pack, please email: <a href=\"mailto:elti@qmu.ac.uk\">elti@qmu.ac.uk</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Closing date<strong>Friday 1<sup>st</sup> December 2023</strong>.</li>\n<li>Interviews will take place on<strong>Thursday 7<sup>th</sup> December 2023</strong>.</li>\n<li>In-person training at the QMU campus will take place on<strong>Thursday 14<sup>th</sup> December 2023</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>ELTI is coordinated and delivered by Queen Margaret University.

In this presentation, Stephen Scoffham and Steve Rawlinson will draw on their <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/sustainability-education-9781350262072/\">highly acclaimed</a> book on this subject to explore different ways forward.  They do not claim to have all the answers, instead they aim to stimulate a rich and informed debate about the options that lie ahead. </p>\n<p>Alan Bainbridge, Reader in Education, ASSaM.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Smoking on Campus – Designated Smoking Area : Reminder</strong></p>\n<p>The University Court agreed that the University, recognising the need to protect the health of students, staff and visitors to the University, should aspire over time to become a non-smoking campus. The Court also recognised the particular challenges presented in enforcing a blanket non-smoking policy on a university campus and agreed that a number of actions should be taken to help towards achieving its goal.</p>\n<p>We have recently noticed an increase in the number of people smoking in the University Square and also an increase in the use of e-cigarettes and vapes in non-designated areas . All staff, students and visitors are reminded that the University <a href=\"/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures/smoking/\">Smoking Policy </a>states that “Smoking is only permitted within the designated smoking area”.  The University has provided a smoking shelter near the pedestrian access from the car park. This is the sole “designated smoking area” on the academic campus and all smokers (including those using e-cigarettes and vapes) are kindly requested to use the smoking shelter. The use of the smoking shelter as the designated smoking area for the academic campus applies 24/7.</p>\n<p>We adopt a collegiate approach to this and we would therefore urge all members of the University community to encourage anyone who engages in smoking outwith the designated shelter, and in particular in the University Square, to move to the smoking shelter. We would also ask that any smoker who is approached with such a request should respond in a polite and courteous manner.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation. </p>\n<p>Bruce Laing</p>\n<p>Director of Campus Services</p>\n<p>Convener of the Health &amp; Safety Committee</p>\n<p> </p>"

QMU’s tutoring scheme, the Enhanced Learning Tutoring Initiative (ELTI) has reached over 200 young people each year since its conception. ELTI was established during the pandemic, with the difficulties associated with that situation. Collaboration has been key to the success of ELTI and working closely with colleagues in schools and community organisations, building strong relationships has helped the tutoring programme grow in strength.

There are two distances on offer; 13.1km and 6.5km. The 13.1km distance is a manageable step up from running 10k and is ideal for those that may not want to do a half marathon. The 6.5km run is great for those progressing from a 5k run.  The route starts by passing by the historic Royal Yacht Britannia then runs along Edinburgh’s tranquil cycle paths, before finishing in front of the West Stand in BT Murrayfield Stadium. It’s nice and flat too!

Within the Essential Information site, there is a newly created section titled <a href=\"/current-students/your-student-journey/\">Your Student Journey</a>. This replaces the former QMU Student Handbook with a view to minimising duplication and bringing together all necessary content at a single location. Programme Leaders and other colleagues are encouraged to share this information with students and to update programme specific materials accordingly, especially where these reference the former Handbook. It is hoped that the new resource will be useful and help students find the information they need more readily than has previously been possible.

By buying from us, you can help us build a women’s hostel, a safe space where they can develop new aspirations and challenge the deep rooted belief that ‘being a man means being in control’.<br /><br />This means that many girls and women who want acceptance are expected to be meek and sexually submissive. Desperate to avoid abject poverty, they believe they must take part in illegal initiation ceremonies at the point they reach puberty (or even younger) which involves being raped by adult men. A practice called ‘the removal of the dust’.<br /><br /> Find out more about our amazing Malawian led charity which is making marginalised women’s voices heard (and is partnered with QMU*) and see our beautiful products at <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.stekaskills.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.stekaskills.com/\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">stekakills.com</a> or find us on <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/STEKAskills\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/STEKAskills\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/steka.skills/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/steka.skills/\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">Instagram</a>.  Watch our film showing how we aim to challenge initiation camps <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKs-Gcpx4aW7FPVATa8t3g\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKs-Gcpx4aW7FPVATa8t3g\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">here</a> .

It should guarantee independence in research, education and scholarship from state and commercial interference. A commitment to academic freedom fosters an environment where diverse perspectives can be explored and debated without fear of repercussion. This safeguard allows scholars to challenge existing norms, question conventional wisdom, and drive the progress of society through rigorous enquiry.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is unique to academics worldwide and protected in Scots law. However, it is often misunderstood, even by academics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Academic freedom is different from freedom of speech, which is enjoyed by all citizens. It is different from professional autonomy. Moreover, academic freedom is never a license for hate speech. Rather, it upholds the values of open inquiry and reinforces the democratic principles that academics hold dear. Various researchers have raised concern that academic freedom is currently under threat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This seminar series will explore academic freedom and discuss, with invited speakers, how QMU academics can make use of our responsibility for academic freedom</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The first seminar in the series is delivered by </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Professor Terence Karran </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Emeritus Professor of Higher Education Policy, University of Lincoln </strong></p>\n<p>Introduced by Sir Paul Grice, Principal</p>\n<p>Convened by Professor Olivia Sagan, Director of Centre for Applied Social Sciences</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday 8th November September 10am-12pm, Room 0048 </strong></p>\n<p>Professor Terence Karran is an international expert in academic freedom, how it is understood and protected (or not) in different parts of the world. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To help assess numbers, please indicate your intention to attend by emailing Eurig Scandrett (<a href=\"mailto:escandrett@qmu.ac.uk\" data-cke-saved-href=\"mailto:escandrett@qmu.ac.uk\">escandrett@qmu.ac.uk</a>) with the subject line ‘Academic Freedom’</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>__________________________________________________________<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"null\"><span class=\"lead\">QMU Entrants' Survey</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dear New QMU Students,<br /><br />We hope you're settling in smoothly.

Our event, which offers students free hot meals and optional activities in our 1875 food court, is part of the University’s drive to help support the QMU community with the cost of living and nurture QMU’s great community spirit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It offers the chance for students to relax and socialise with students and staff volunteers, and enjoy a chilled-out evening in QMU’s food court. During the colder months, the event offers a warm, cosy and friendly space to meet up with the QMU community and enjoy a sociable meal without the need to cook or heat your home for a few hours. TGIT proved very popular last year, and everyone is warmly invited. We want you to feel supported and fully part of the QMU community.   </p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>So don’t miss out on the chance of a free meal. TGIT will run on <strong>Thursday 28 September</strong> in 1875 from 5pm - 7pm. You can expect hot soup and a hot main course (vegan option available too). If you bring a food container (tupperware) you might even be able to take home some leftovers! Come and enjoy yourself. We won’t even ask you to do the washing up!  </p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you in 1875 in the main academic building at 5pm on <strong>Thursday 28 September</strong>, and we will keep you posted about more TGIT events throughout the year.   </p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Shibboleth server maintenance Tuesday 3rd October. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Information Technology Services (ITS) will be performing critical maintenance on the Shibboleth Authentication server between 06:00 to 08:00 on Tuesday 3<sup>rd</sup> October.

Choose from three or five lunches a week depending on your living arrangements and your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>We know how important it is to have a varied and balanced diet. By taking out a meal plan, you can be safe in the knowledge that you will be getting high-quality, home cooked, nutritious food.</p>\n<p>All meals are chosen from 1875 restaurant. 1875 is QMU’s main eatery where all your favourites are served, from daily hot mains with a wide selection of dietary friendly and vegan options including full salad &amp; deli bar, soups and baked potatoes. Our vision is to provide fresh, locally sourced, good food made by our talented chefs to the highest possible standard. Menus change daily and are influenced by the seasonality of ingredients to ensure best quality and provide wholesome and balanced meals paired with a little flair and fun!</p>\n<p>QMU Meal Plans are great value and will help our new students in particular settle into University life quickly and allow everyone to focus on university priorities without the stresses of having to shop and cook food for themselves on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Full details about the QMU Meal Plans and how to sign up to them, can be found on our website <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/d849834a5ec6413fbdf7de71ef3a212f}?m=1qdtWO-0004Ea-47&amp;d=4%7Cmail%2F90%2F1694010000%2F1qdtWO-0004Ea-47%7Cin6i%7C57e1b682%7C11114464%7C13716157%7C64F88C9CDE9850284C6FB6DD0AF6460E&amp;o=%2Fphts%3A%2Futscm14iilh.amcmptm%2Fc.oslx%2Fuck%3Fcishrl3tp%25%3DtwFA%25w2Fw2%25.u.qkacum.uc%252-mpsFaeelit2Faf%25id-akdrnn-p--osamuncmq%252au-eFm%25ll-Fns2pa3_%2531l%25DFg81%252yuunAo2_%252Mp%25AAuc%25Q.i6gl.2aDd%25QAII3EphobNIq6CMVYwfYgIEf_whBQO24nB2AYEAgSAEAAwvKp%25_BEoDcc263sr%25glx.Dads%26iwd2d%3Dfda4c307if%267%3D10udi725%3D%26id335110p88%2600p%3Dooaemllt%26tte%3Dstv_e4%3D2%261690c1e605eh%3D51%26b8a6ccce57447ea0f81d50c0cc340e7a2f5ac9dd3445e48ed9f52dd509dd6&amp;s=NCEMZDf4TzS3Kqd5EyaxubM76SA\" title=\"QMU Meal Plans\" data-anchor=\"?m=1qdtWO-0004Ea-47&amp;d=4%7Cmail%2F90%2F1694010000%2F1qdtWO-0004Ea-47%7Cin6i%7C57e1b682%7C11114464%7C13716157%7C64F88C9CDE9850284C6FB6DD0AF6460E&amp;o=%2Fphts%3A%2Futscm14iilh.amcmptm%2Fc.oslx%2Fuck%3Fcishrl3tp%25%3DtwFA%25w2Fw2%25.u.qkacum.uc%252-mpsFaeelit2Faf%25id-akdrnn-p--osamuncmq%252au-eFm%25ll-Fns2pa3_%2531l%25DFg81%252yuunAo2_%252Mp%25AAuc%25Q.i6gl.2aDd%25QAII3EphobNIq6CMVYwfYgIEf_whBQO24nB2AYEAgSAEAAwvKp%25_BEoDcc263sr%25glx.Dads%26iwd2d%3Dfda4c307if%267%3D10udi725%3D%26id335110p88%2600p%3Dooaemllt%26tte%3Dstv_e4%3D2%261690c1e605eh%3D51%26b8a6ccce57447ea0f81d50c0cc340e7a2f5ac9dd3445e48ed9f52dd509dd6&amp;s=NCEMZDf4TzS3Kqd5EyaxubM76SA\">here</a><a href=\"/campus-life/eat-and-drink-on-campus/qmu-meal-plans/?_gl=1*1ouu8ny*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp6NwffY_gIVEYBQBh224wnOEAAYASAAEgKpovD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">.</a> Meal plans for Semester 1 have to be booked by Sunday 3<sup>rd</sup> September.</p>\n<p>If you have any queries about the QMU Meal Plans, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with our Catering Team on: <a href=\"mailto:mealplans@qmu.ac.uk\">mealplans@qmu.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p><strong>____________________________________________________________</strong></p>\n<h2><br /><strong>qmploy 2023 - QMU Early Careers Fair</strong></h2>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p>QMU Careers and Employability invites all staff and students to attend qmploy 2023.</p>\n<p>An opportunity to meet 40+ organisations on campus.

This will affect around 15% of modules.</p>\n<p>We are sorry that we need to do this and apologise for any inconvenience it causes you. Although we try to avoid timetable changes, this action is necessary on this occasion as a result of a number of factors across the University.<br /><br />We will manage these changes as swiftly and efficiently as practicable. We would ask you not to contact Timetable, Academic Staff or Academic Administration regarding this matter, as this will delay progress and because they may not be able to definitively answer your question at that time.<br /><br />While these changes are ongoing we recommend that you check your personalised timetable on the MyQMU App or on the Student Portal for any changes the day before each of your classes to ensure you are looking at the most up to date information.<br /><br />If a change to your timetable means that you are no longer able to make a class, you should record the absence via the student portal and advise your Module Tutor. Thank you.</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________</p>\n<h2>Have your say on future plans for the LRC</h2>\n<p>We are hosting an event with the Architects to give you an opportunity to see, and comment on, the proposals for the redevelopment of the LRC space in the coming years. This event will be held between 10am and 3pm on Thursday 14 September in the Atrium. Library Services staff will also be on hand to answer any questions that you have.</p>\n<p>A link to more details on the plans will be forthcoming</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n<h2><strong>October 20th marks World Osteoporosis Day 2023</strong></h2>\n<p>Queen Margaret University and the Lydia Plus Osteoporosis Project are hosting a day of learning, practical tips and collaboration to showcase the latest research in bone health and osteoporosis.

As well as capturing student views on the overall quality of their undergraduate degree, the survey gathers students’ responses to a series of questions relating to academic support, learning resources, teaching, management and assessment. Feedback from the students on the quality of their courses and their experience of university, helps to inform prospective students’ choices, provide data that helps universities improve the student experience, and supports public accountability.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p><span><strong>Changes to the NSS</strong></span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>As a result of the review of the NSS, the survey questions and response scales have changed for NSS 2023. The main changes include: new direct questions with a 4-point item specific response scale, replacing the Likert response scale (with the exception of the overall satisfaction, healthcare practice placement questions and optional bank questions); a new additional question on mental wellbeing services; the overall satisfaction question is asked to students in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland only; and a new additional question on freedom of expression, which is asked to students in England only. Because of these changes, it is not valid to compare question level responses from NSS 2023 with those from previous years.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span

Following that analysis, we will work with student representatives and selected programme teams, as well as our Learning Enhancement and Academic Development unit,  to develop an action plan, and to identify what support is required to enable specific enhancements, with the objective of ensuring a high-quality student experience across the institution.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Richard</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Professor Richard Butt BA (Hons) PhD</p>\n<p>Deputy Principal and Deputy Vice-Chancellor</p>\n<p>* As student populations are different across providers it is not always helpful to directly compare results of one provider with another. To account for some of the factors which contribute to different NSS results, benchmarks are constructed. These benchmarks are sector averages, which are adjusted based on the characteristics of the group. The factors that are taken into account when constructing the benchmarks are: mode of study, subject of study, level of study, age, ethnicity, disability and sex. For example, it may be the case that a difference in positivity measure between two providers can be accounted for by their different subject mix, or the different ages of their students. We can think of the benchmark as a prediction of what the NSS results for the sector would have been, had the sector had the same breakdown of students and subjects as the population we are interested in.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">2023/2024 Academic Timetable</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Returning Students can now access their personalised timetable for academic year 2023/2024 via the QMU Student portal or the myQMU app.  Full details on how to access the QMU Student Portal &amp; myQMU app can be found <a href=\"/study-here/learning-facilities/it-services/myqmu-mobile-application/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>For further information on what’s included in personalised timetables can be found <a href=\"/media/lg5lxdp0/student-portal-leaflet.pdf\">here</a> and for information on how to request a group swap please visit the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/timetables/\">timetable page</a> on the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/timetables/\">QMU website</a>.</p>\n<p>For a small number of modules and programmes, students cannot be assigned to some groups in advance and this is done once teaching starts based on lists provided by academic staff.

You might be aware that last year, the Health Visiting Programme achieved a UNICEF Stage 2 accreditation. This was a massive achievement for everyone involved and we are now striving to achieve the ‘Gold Standard’ accreditation. This will see the University embed the core principles and outcomes of the BFI across all areas and achieve sustainability of the standards. </span></p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">We are passionate about promoting QMU as a safe and supportive space, where staff, students and those from the local community, can feel comfortable and confident to feed their children on campus and in Maggie’s. </span></p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">We are currently in discussions about ways to move this forward and would also love to hear the voices from those on campus.
