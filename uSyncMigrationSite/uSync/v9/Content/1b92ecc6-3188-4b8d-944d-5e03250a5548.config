<p>Sierra Leone, Lebanon, El Salvador<span><span class="lead"><br /></span></span>2017 - Present<span><span class="lead"><br /></span>The NIHR Research Unit on Health in Situations of Fragility (RUHF) focuses on contexts where displacement, conflict, pandemic disease or weak capacity makes the delivery of health services especially challenging. Although its work seeks to be of wide relevance to the delivery of healthcare in situations of fragility, RUHF especially focuses on two vital but commonly neglected areas of health provision in these contexts: mental health and psychosocial support and the treatment and prevention of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. RUHF Researchers at the QMU’s Institute for Global Health and Development (IGHD) work closely with the Unit's collaborative partners -the Global Health Institute, American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon, and the College of Medicine &amp; Allied Health Science (COMAHS), Freetown, Sierra Leone.</span></p>

<p>Uganda<span class="lead"><br /></span>2022 - 2024</p>
<p>Founder: This work is supported by a grant from the Health Systems Research Initiative with funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the UK Medical Research Council and Wellcome, in collaboration with the UK Economic and Social Research Council (grant no. MR/V015192/1).</p>
<p>Partners: Makerere School of Public Health, Uganda; Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p>
<p>Harnessing institutional and individual memory and experience of responding to past infectious disease outbreaks is critical yet neglected in current epidemic preparedness systems. In resource-poor and fragmented health systems experiencing infectious disease outbreaks including Coronavirus disease, health care workers (HCW) negotiate globalised standards for infection prevention control (IPC) under locally specific conditions and constraints: both in everyday ‘routine’ working environments and in times of crisis, decisions are made at individual and institutional levels that balance the need to care alongside that to protect.  Set in Uganda, a country that has experienced multiple ID outbreaks in recent decades, this project applies a relational approach to the study of IPC measures in the context of care provision in health facilities and communities.  Our aim is to contribute to the learning health system for epidemic preparedness during and beyond the COVID-19 crisis. Through collaborative exchange with relevant stakeholders at national and regional level, our project will deliver findings to inform health protection practices and protocols, optimise safe and compassionate care for vulnerable populations, and strengthen learning health systems for future epidemics both within and beyond Ugandan borders.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Reducing the burden of severe stigmatising skin diseases (REDRESS)<br /></span></p>
<p>Liberia<br />2019 - 2023</p>
<p>Founder: NIHR</p>
<p>Partners: Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine; The Ministry of Health, Liberia; Action Transforming Lives (ACTS); University of Liberia, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (UL-PIRE); AIM Initiative; Effect Hope; and Queen Margaret’s University.</p>
<p>Liberia is one of the first countries globally to develop an integrated package of care for SSSDs. This means managing diseases with signs on the skin (e.g. lymphatic filariasis, hydrocele, leprosy, Buruli ulcer, yaws and onchocerciasis), through a combined approach at the local clinic. This project brings together globally recognised expertise in SSSDs, to gather evidence about patient knowledge, priorities and experiences and the equity and effectiveness of the current approach.</p>
<p><span class="lead">VAPAR: Verbal Autopsy with Participatory Action Research: Expanding the knowledge base through partnerships for action of equity</span></p>
<p>South Africa<br />2019 - 2023</p>
<p>Founder: The research is supported by the <strong>Health Systems Research Initiative</strong> from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development"><strong>Department for International Development</strong></a> (DFID)/ <a href="https://mrc.ukri.org/"><strong>Medical Research Council</strong></a> (MRC)/ <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/"><strong>Wellcome Trust</strong></a>/ <a href="https://esrc.ukri.org/"><strong>Economic and Social Research Council</strong></a> (ESRC) (MR/N005597/1, MR/P014844/1)</p>
<p>Partners: VAPAR is a multi-partner research project, with collaboration between Queen Margaret University, <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/"><strong>University of Aberdeen</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.mpuhealth.gov.za/"><strong>Mpumalanga Department of Health</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/"><strong>University of Witwatersrand</strong></a>, Johannesburg and <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/"><strong>Umeå University</strong></a>, Sweden. To find out more about specific people working on this project as well as other project partners, see the People &amp; Partners page on the <a href="https://www.vapar.org/about"><strong>VAPAR website</strong></a></p>
<p>Many deaths in low- and middle-income countries occur because of exclusion from health systems, due to financial, bureaucratic or geographical issues, as well as wider factors which affect health. The research in this project aims to understand why these barriers may exist and provide the evidence to groups at all levels of the health and other public administrative systems in order to make positive change. Work completed through IGHD at Queen Margaret University will contribute to all areas of the project, including analysis of existing evidence from verbal autopsy and engagement with communities in Mpumalanga; feeding that evidence into an action research cycle, involving communities and multi-sectoral actors; and assessing and fine-tuning the programme approach over a repeated cycle. The aspiration is to contribute to more participatory approaches in the health and other sectors longer term in South Africa and beyond, contributing to better governance and public engagement.
