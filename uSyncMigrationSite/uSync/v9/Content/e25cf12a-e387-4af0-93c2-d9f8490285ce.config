      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Every question I ever had, I always found an answer, whether it was from the lecturer or a book in the library. That was the thing I appreciated the most. The lecturers helped me to see how the tourism industry works and all the things I could do, and after I got some practical experience in the tourism industry as part of the course, I saw that was what I wanted to do with my life.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What was one of the highlights from your course?</span></p>
<p>I wasn’t sure that I would use some of the things we learned in the course, like Economics and Logistics, until I started my internship as a Marketing Assistant at Expedia. It's so good when the manager asks you if you know how to do something and you do! It was nice to be able to use the tools I learned at QMU and to see them in practice. When I meet prospective students looking at the course, I always tell them that they must pay attention in the Economics and Logistics modules because I'm 100% sure that they will need them.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Did you take part in any extra-curricular activities during your time at QMU?</span></p>
<p>I was a Student Representative in my third and fourth years. I always listened to my classmates and what they had to say and tried to give that information to the program leader.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How important was it for you to do your degree at a UK university?</span></p>
<p>It was very important. I was interested in the British education system. I'm sure that if I went to a Greek State university, I would not have gotten this far now.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How did your lecturers support your learning?</span></p>
<p>Metropolitan College has a very friendly environment. I had some issues because I'm not from a wealthy background so I had to work to pay for my loans and to support my family at the same time. I was always able to contact my lecturers if I couldn't come to class or had further questions, they were always available to answer questions. I felt connected to QMU through the online library.</p>
<p><span class="lead">How do you feel about having graduated?</span></p>
<p>The only thing my parents wanted for me was for me to have a proper education. And now they see I have finally finished and have a British degree. It's really amazing to see my father being proud.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Can you tell us about your post-graduation plans?</span></p>
<p><br />I'm going to do some travelling, and then work for a few years - so I can get some feedback on my work - and then maybe a master’s degree. I grew up with my father telling me you have to create something of your own.</p>]]></Value>

<p><span class="lead">What attracted you to the course?</span></p>
<p>It's a funny story. It was a five-minute decision. I came to start a course in digital filmmaking, then I saw the International Tourism and Hospitality Management course and the opportunities, and I thought to myself: 'I need to get out of my comfort zone and just think about what I can do with my future’. There’s a lot of things that can be developed in the tourism industry. It’s kind of artistic because you need to be creative to find all the things to do. So I thought 'ok, I'm going to try this and if I don't like it, I can change and do a different course next semester.'</p>]]></Value>
