Never transfer money unless you are sure that the situation is authentic.</p>\n<p>For short-term accommodation, hostels are the cheapest option and Edinburgh offers many clean and centrally located hostels.</p>\n<p>If you are staying for an extended amount of time, ask if they can give you a weekly rate.

In addition you may want to factor in other costs including telephone, internet and a TV licence as these will not be included in the rent. Please note that most landlords will request one month rent in advance in addition to your deposit.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Deposit</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Due to concerns that some private landlords unfairly withhold tenants’ deposits, since 2011 the Scottish Government has introduced the “Tenancy Deposit Schemes (Scotland) Regulations 2011”.</p>\n<p>Under this legislation the method by which a deposit is taken and held by landlords has changed. All private landlords must now place the deposit paid into a tenancy deposit scheme.</p>\n<p>The deposit resides within the deposit scheme and is repaid to the tenant by the scheme administrator should there be no dispute at the end of the lease. In the case of a dispute the scheme will provide a resolution service. This means the tenant can ask for the case to be referred to an independent adjudicator. The adjudicator will make a decision about how the deposit should be repaid, based on the evidence provided by both parties. </p>\n<p>Some landlords/letting agents may ask for a ‘holding fee’ – a sum of money that will mean that they stop advertising the property and will hold it for you. Landlords should not ask for a holding fee as this is deemed as an ‘illegal fee’.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>For further information see <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.mygov.scot/tenancy-deposits-landlords\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Scottish government website\">visit the mygov.scot website.</a></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>MAKE SURE YOU KEEP A RECEIPT FOR ALL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS FROM YOUR LANDLORD.</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

A tenancy agreement is a contract between you and your landlord that sets out your rights to live in a rented property.</p>\n<p>From December 2017 all tenancies in the private sector are private residential tenancies. There are no fixed terms which means your landlord cannot ask you to leave just because you’ve been in the property for 6 months. Your rent can only be increased once every 12 months and if you think the proposed increase is unfair, you can refer it to a rent officer. If you’ve lived in a property for longer than 6 months, your landlord will have to give you at least 84 days’ notice to leave (unless you’ve broken a term in the tenancy). You can find more information <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/policies/private-renting/private-tenancy-reform/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Private Renting Reform\">here</a></p>\n<p>Renting from a private owner, letting agency or moving in with other people that already have a flat will give you flexibility in choosing how long you stay. It is important that you fully read and understand your tenancy agreement.</p>\n<p>A tenancy agreement must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name of the landlord and the name of the tenant</li>\n<li>The address of the property to be rented</li>\n<li>The amount of rent to pay</li>\n<li>How long the lease is for (if this isn’t specified it will be assumed to be open-ended).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How can I make sure my tenancy agreement is fair?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Your tenancy agreement should be written in simple language that you can easily understand. It shouldn’t contain any unfair terms. Examples of unfair terms might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A sentence stating that your landlord can change the terms of the tenancy agreement whenever they like and that you will have to accept the new terms.</li>\n<li>A sentence saying that the you have to pay for repairs that should be your landlord’s responsibility</li>\n<li>A sentence saying that your landlord can enter the property whenever they like, without giving you notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Your rights and responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p>The property which you live in is your home. This gives you certain rights.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a right to ‘quiet enjoyment’ of your home. This means that the landlord must give you 24 hours written notice if they require access. The landlord cannot let himself/herself in with a key without your permission unless you have signed an agreement allowing this.</li>\n<li>Security of Tenure. You can stay in the property unless the landlord follows the correct procedure to evict you. If you require advice on this contact the Citizen’s Advice Bureau or a legal advisor.</li>\n<li>The Right to Repair. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 requires the landlord to keep essential services, water, gas, electricity, sanitation in a state of repair and also the exterior and structure of the property in good repair. Make sure you ask your landlord for repairs in writing and keep copies of all correspondence.</li>\n<li>Safety. The landlord must have all electrical appliances tested on an annual basis by a competent person and have a gas safety certificate for any gas installations. Any soft furnishings must also comply with fire safety regulations.</li>\n<li>Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO). The regulations compel landlords renting flats to 3 or more unrelated persons to meet a range of fire safety and management standards dictated by Edinburgh City Council. An HMO licence is not required if a flat is let to a couple and a friend, as the couple will count as one person. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If in doubt, you require more information or want to check if your landlord has an HMO licence, contact the City of Edinburgh Council on +44 (0)131 200 2000.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Along with rights come responsibilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must act in a ‘tenant-like’ manner. This means that you must take care of the property and avoid causing a nuisance to neighbours.</li>\n<li>You are responsible for paying the rent as agreed with the landlord. If you do not pay the landlord, they will be able to take action to evict you.</li>\n<li>You will also be responsible for paying the bills in the flat. Gas, electricity, telephone must all be paid. Students are not normally liable for Council Tax, but if you share with a non-student you should contact the City of Edinburgh Council for up-to-date advice.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
