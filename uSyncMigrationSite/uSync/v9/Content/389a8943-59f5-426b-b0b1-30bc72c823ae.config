      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Yolanda initially trained as an actor in Madrid and then moved to London to study Contemporary Dance and Physical Theatre at Middlesex University, where she gained a BA (Hons) in Dance Performance.</p>
<p>Before moving to Scotland, Yolanda performed with Adam Benjamin, co-founder of Candoco Dance Company and Green Candle Dance. It was here that Yolanda decided that she wanted to pursue a career in creative learning and community dance. </p>
<p>Since 2010, Yolanda has worked as a coordinator, project manager and creative learning manager in different arts organisations across Scotland. A highlight of this experience for Yolanda was the youth Mfest at Macrobert Arts Centre, where she produced an international collaboration with the world-famous company, La Fura dels Baus, from Barcelona and a group of young performers.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to study at QMU?</strong></p>
<p><span>“In April 2015, I co-founded Shaper/Caper, a small dance company based in Dundee that operates mostly across Tayside, although we also tour internationally. It soon became apparent that we needed a sound knowledge of operational frameworks to help develop the business and direct it towards its essence. As we were a member of The Federation of Scottish Theatre, we became aware of the possibility of accessing a bursary to study at QMU due to the partnership."</span></p>
<p><strong> <span>Why did you choose to study in Edinburgh/Scotland?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>“At Middlesex University, I was part of a physical theatre production that showcased at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. I immediately adored the vibrancy of the city and the popular celebration of art, promising myself that I would return at a later stage in life. After performing in London for three years, I was seeking nature and a slower pace of life, so I fulfilled my promise and moved to Scotland.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What did you hope the course would give you in terms of career progression and continuing personal development?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>“I was looking for the course to provide a robust foundation of operational knowledge, as well as an academic framework to base it around. I had a strong desire to develop my career from performance and basic administrative tasks to more complex strategic and governance responsibilities.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How did you find the workload? Did you receive support from QMU? </span></strong></p>
<p><span>“As I’d not been in education for a while, I found the workload in the first year rather challenging, as I continued working whilst studying, including international tours. However, I felt well supported as QMU offered several strands of support across departments. Discussing my concerns with colleagues also helped me to put matters into perspective.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Did you work during the course? </span></strong></p>
<p><span>“During the course, I continued to work full-time at Shaper/Caper, a small dance company with a wide portfolio of creative learning projects across Tayside. I worked in management and administration, delivering workshops and producing national and international tours throughout my studies.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Did you benefit from any scholarships or bursaries to help fund your studies at QMU? </span></strong></p>
<p><span>“As Shaper/Caper is a Federation of Scottish Theatre member, we were able to capitalise on the scholarship offered to its representatives, which helped fund my studies at QMU.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How do you think your QMU degree has equipped you with the skills/knowledge to develop your career?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>“The course has been critical in equipping me with all the necessary skills to operate the small company I work in. I created a business plan for the company, so I was able to apply all my learning directly to my work, benefitting the business and the staff. </span></p>
<p><span>“On a personal note, I re-discovered a passion for learning and soon became confident to raise my voice within the sector.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What are your top tips for future students? </span></strong></p>
<p><span>“Enjoy the ride! It’s going to be hard, but you are not alone, so share your concerns and have a laugh. </span></p>
<p><span>“I started running half-way through the course and noticed the effects of becoming fit and having a clearer mind. Get inspired by the people around you also working hard, including the lecturers.” </span></p>
<p><strong><span>What have you been doing since graduating from QMU?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>“So, it’s not even a year since I graduated and the effects on my business have been extraordinary, having discovered a passion and a skill as a fundraiser. </span></p>
<p><span>“We continue to apply the business plan regularly, revising it and adapting it as we expand as a company. It’s clear to me that there is a direct correlation between the course and the progress that the company has recently made. </span></p>
<p><span>“I continue to work at Shaper/Caper. We’re now expanding staff numbers and activity as there is always a great deal of work to do. Due to the imminent opening of the V&amp;A in Dundee, the city is on the cusp of a great cultural, economic and social transformation. We are finding our place and creating new partnerships in the area. </span></p>
<p><span>“Inspired by QMU’s Head of Division for Media, Communication and Performing Arts, Dr. David Stevenson, and his exceptional prolific attitude and desire to effect change in the cultural sector, I recently became a trustee at Arts and Business Scotland, which is a fantastic opportunity to support the organisation as well as to develop my own career.”</span></p>
