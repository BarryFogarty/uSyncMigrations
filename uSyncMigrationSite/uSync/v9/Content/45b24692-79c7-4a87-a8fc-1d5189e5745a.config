      <Value><![CDATA[<p>You will create a significant piece of original research which, in the process, will put you in a very strong position for progression in your chosen academic or professional field, or to change the direction of your career.</p>
<p>Your doctorate is a substantial piece of learning and research, reflecting three or more years of endeavour, that will have commercial, cultural or social value. It is also a process through which you will acquire advanced research knowledge, skills and expertise, be challenged and possibly transform as a person. The training programme for your doctorate will require significant personal discipline, time and commitment. In return, your sense of achievement at the end will be immense, and successful completion of your doctorate will open up a range of opportunities for career advancement.</p>]]></Value>

    "content": "<p>Enrolling on a doctoral degree programme is one of the biggest decisions you can make regarding your education and learning in your career. We want your doctoral programme experience to be based around feeling part of a thriving learning community. The importance and power of peer support cannot be underestimated during doctoral-level study, so engaging with the community of doctoral candidates (students), supervisors and academics that exists at QMU is a core element in your programme. It is the community of learning that grounds you and your studies and gives you the strength to stay engaged and curious, and to design and craft your research and thesis as well as publications. Your final thesis will be an original and rigorous piece of research and scholarship that is something you feel passionate about and is of relevance to the University.</p>\n<p>QMU’s Graduate School offers research supervision by academics who are active researchers, many of whom have an international track record and connections to other international researchers working in their field. All doctoral candidates are hosted by a research centre or an institute, and the various research centres and institutes offer significant peer support and learning opportunities such as seminars and workshops.</p>\n<p>The Graduate School also coordinates a Doctoral Candidates’ Association that offers a supportive community as well as organising informal learning opportunities including their annual DCA Conference.</p>\n<p>QMU is a member of the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science (SGSSS) and the Scottish Graduate School of Arts and Humanities (SGSAH). These memberships allow QMU doctoral candidates to access a large range of additional doctoral training and development opportunities, notably advanced skills training, internships, local conferences and summer schools.</p>"

The doctorate is ultimately assessed by the thesis, publications or creative work, and a final viva examination. The usual  length of a PhD thesis is from 70,000 to 100,000 words.
