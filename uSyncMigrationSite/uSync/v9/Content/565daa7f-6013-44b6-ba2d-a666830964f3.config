      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The full day event, which will be held on the 17th April, will involve a range of inspirational speakers including Andy Murray, the Scottish doctor and exercise advocate, who is known for running 78 consecutive days in the Moroccan Sahara, Dee Sissons, the Director of Nursing for Marie Curie UK as well as David Duke, the founder of the charity Street Soccer Scotland, who helps homeless people engage in football and get their lives back on track.</p>
<p>The aim of TEDx events is to share ideas with individuals, communities and organisations. Organised by Queen Margaret University, the theme of the event is ‘Flourishing People, Spaces and Places’ which will see an eclectic range of speakers and TED Talks to engage in a wide variety of topics such as recovering from homelessness, the importance of exercise to health and wellbeing, urban poverty, flourishing in times of economic hardship and flourishing in dying.</p>
<p>Professor Brendan McCormack, Head of Division of Nursing at QMU will host the event. Professor McCormack has 24 years specialist experience in the nursing of older people and is considered an internationally-renowned authority on person-centred nursing and practice development.</p>
<p>Commenting on the selection of the theme, Professor McCormack, describes ‘Flourishing’ as being “a core part of our humanity that sometimes becomes drowned by stress, poor leadership and routinized work. This theme will help to remind us all of the need to celebrate the importance of innovation, passion, community and connectedness”.</p>
<p>Professor Petra Wend, Principal of Queen Margaret University, will also speak at the event. She explained: “Queen Margaret has a long history of nursing through our programmes in Scotland and internationally, and of working with allied health professionals. We are delighted to have attracted such an interesting range of speakers to our first ever TEDx event which we hope will offer a high quality learning experience for both our students and nursing and health professionals. Of course, the theme of ‘flourishing’ fits with the University’s aim of improving quality of life”.</p>
<p>The event will be held on 17 th April at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh and will be streamed live online to allow our colleagues in our Singapore campus to join in as well as the wider QMU and TEDx audience.</p>
<p>Delegates will hear from the following guest speakers during the day-long event. These are:</p>
<p>Dr Andy Murray- Freelance Sports and Medicine Doctor, who will focus on ‘Flourishing through Exercise’</p>
<p>Dee Sissons- Director of Nursing Marie Curie Cancer Care UK , who will focus on touching topic ‘Flourishing in Dying’</p>
<p>David Duke- Chief Executive of Street Soccer (Scotland), who will focus on ‘Flourishing through Football’</p>
<p>Janice Burr- Leader of Musselburgh based choir, Clark Community Choir, will be performing on the day with a lively ‘Generations Singing Together’ set list</p>
<p>Jane and Alison Gordon- Co-founders of Sisters for Change, who will talk about ‘Women Flourishing in a Fairer World’</p>
<p>Mike Stevenson- Managing Director of Thinktastic, a prominent social entrepreneur who will focus on ‘Flourishing in Urban Poverty’</p>
<p>To book a place at the event, email <a href="mailto:tedx@qmu.ac.uk">tedx@qmu.ac.uk</a> by 23rd March 2015. Spaces are limited and based on a first come first serve basis.</p>
