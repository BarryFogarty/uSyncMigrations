Katie has also campaigned for reduced waiting times for the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders.</p>
<p>In May, Katie was invited to give a speech at the Scottish Parliament and was subsequently asked to co-chair the Scottish Government's 'Working Bodies' group. The group consists of clinicians, researchers and charity workers who have been busy developing a plan to encourage Scotland’s young people to be “body positive”.</p>
<p>“It’s [Working Bodies] all about encouraging people to appreciate their body for all its lumps and bumps and remembering that it’s yours,” said Katie. “It's the only one we've got so we shouldn't feel so pressured to shrink it because some influencer on social media said it looked better that way.”</p>
<p>After graduation, Katie hopes to combine her love for drama with her passion for promoting positive mental health by pursuing a career in dramatherapy. In the meantime, she is focusing on completing her degree.</p>
