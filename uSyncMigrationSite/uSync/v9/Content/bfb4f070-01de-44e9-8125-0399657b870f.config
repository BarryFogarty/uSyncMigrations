<p><span class="lead">What can we offer your organisation?</span></p>
<p><strong>1. Academic insight with a focus on practical application</strong></p>
<p>A distinctive feature of our approach is our mix of practitioner and academic staff, which allows us to provide our clients with the latest insights from research, policy and practice. Our consultancy services are rooted in our academic research, bringing academic rigour to our work, while being very much focused on the practical application of that research.</p>
<p>For example, through our research, we have developed a five-step Dispute System Design model for consumer dispute resolution, which sets out a series of steps involved in designing a consumer dispute resolution system from the start. We apply this model when helping organisations to design or improve their dispute resolution systems.</p>
<p><strong>2. Flexible services tailored to your organisation’s specific needs</strong></p>
<p>We can offer a flexible range of consultancy services, which can be specifically tailored to meet your organisation’s needs.</p>
<p>Our complaints consultancy services can include, for example, advising on the introduction of a new complaints system, or carrying out a fundamental review or evaluation of an existing system. We can also provide assistance with <span style="font-size: 14px;">specific aspects of complaints handling, such as goal setting or process design (for further information, see our Dispute System Design Model). We understand that your requirements will also vary depending on factors such as the sector within which your organisation operates; the size of the organisation; its customer base; and the regulatory requirements you must comply with.</span></p>
<div class="page">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><strong>3. A focus on the perspectives of both consumers and organisations</strong></p>
<p>We place a particular emphasis on taking the consumer perspective into account in our work, to ensure that this is fully considered in ensuring that systems and processes meet consumers’ needs. In the design of complaints systems, for example, we consider what consumers want and need from a complaint process, and how to place them at the heart of the process.</p>
<p>We are also focused on the needs of your organisation and your staff. In our complaints work, for example, we consider the needs of your complaints handling staff, and how they might best be supported to provide high quality, consumer focused complaints handling services.</p>
<p>You can find further details of the types of consultancy and research assistance we can provide on the next few pages of this brochure, together with examples of projects which we have delivered.</p>

<p>“The Consumer Dispute Resolution Centre offers an excellent range of services for alternative dispute resolution providers. Staff at the Legal Ombudsman have benefitted from the Centre’s CPD courses and are participating in the MSc Dispute Resolution programme. One member of staff is also engaged in PhD study with the University. The Centre’s courses have a practical focus, at the same time as drawing on academic research, and they have been a key resource in the development of the Legal Ombudsman. We have also commissioned several research projects from the Centre, which have been important in shaping our thinking in relation to our processes and future strategic thinking. The Consumer Dispute Resolution Centre is very client-focused and has consistently provided us with a professional and very timely service.”</p>

<p>“The payments industry is subject to fundamental change at present. With the inexorable influence of technology enabling ever faster change in the ways people access and use payment services and financial services generally the need for effective engagement of end users in decision making is more critical than ever. To help understand how best to achieve that aim Bacs worked with the Consumer Dispute Resolution Centre at Queen Margaret University. The resulting report provided an excellent review of the strengths and weaknesses of different representation mechanisms and led to an effective overhaul of Bacs’ different governance and representative structures. The CDRC brought an excellent balance of academic rigour with practical experience of governance to produce recommendations that were clear and deliverable.”</p>

<p>Complaints handling is one of our primary areas of expertise. The Centre is a leading provider of ombudsman and complaint handling courses. We have also developed a free guide to complaints handling, which aims to help organisations to improve their complaints process, to the benefit of those who complain, for your organisation itself and for your staff.</p>
