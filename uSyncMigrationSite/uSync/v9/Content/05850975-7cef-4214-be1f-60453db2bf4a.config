<p><strong>Why QMU?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A proud history in food science:</strong> We have an impressive track record in food, nutrition and health dating back well over a hundred years, evolving from the Edinburgh School of Cookery (est.1875). In 2014, the University launched its <a href="/research-and-knowledge-exchange/research-centres-institutes-and-knowledge-exchange-centres/scottish-centre-for-food-development-and-innovation/">Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation</a> in response to the growth of Scotland’s food and drink industry. QMU has continued to focus on contributing in practical ways to improving people’s lives and serving the community. We are ambitious in our vision to support Scotland’s food and drink industry, and are well underway with our plans to develop the Edinburgh Innovation Hub on land adjacent to our campus in Musselburgh. The Hub will focus on food and drink related innovation within the context of health and wellbeing.</li>
<li><strong>Responding to industry needs:</strong> This course has evolved from our previous degree in Nutrition and Food Science, but has been designed to respond to the current needs of the food industry. We continue to build on our traditions and continue to work with the food industry and the wider community.</li>
<li><strong>Preparing you with the skills for a rewarding career:</strong> As a graduate of this course, you will have the ability to exercise initiative and personal responsibility that enables decision-making in complex and unpredictable contexts, demonstrate team working skills necessary to flourish in the global workplace, communication skills that ensure information, ideas, problems and solutions are communicated effectively and clearly to both specialist and non-specialist audiences. You will have IT and digital literacy skills with an ability to work at the interface of creativity and new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Learning and teaching methods designed to help you succeed:</strong> We aim to provide a transformative student experience that encourages critical thinking, lifelong learning habits, enthusiasm to learn and debate and professional and ethical working behaviours. We wish to create a community of socially and globally aware citizens of the future.</li>
<li><strong>Specialist facilities:</strong> We have specialist food product development, sensory, microbiology and food analysis facilities. We have a range of industrially focused analytical equipment to technically assess products in terms of texture, colour, moisture, acidity, brix and fat stability. We also have a range of industrial processing equipment. These facilities will enable you to develop the skills that the industry is looking for. There will be the opportunity for you to do your honours project, in year 4, using our specialist facilities at QMU or in collaboration with industry.</li>
<li><strong>Staff support and expertise:</strong> Staff in our Division of Dietetics, Nutrition and Biological Sciences are active researchers and ensure that course content is relevant to the changing nature of the industry. Our interaction with the QMU Centre for Food Development and Innovation, allows us to provide an industry perspective. Smaller class sizes allow our staff to provide you with excellent support and we encourage you along every step of your time at QMU.</li>
<li><strong>Industry relevance and input:</strong> Our alumni who work in the industry will deliver seminars. You will also have the opportunity to go on factory visits. We will also highlight to you the webinars and student focussed career events run by the IFST, the professional body for food scientists and technologists in the UK.  </li>
<li><strong>Placement will allow you to put theory into practice:</strong> A placement in Year Three, will allow you to apply your learning in the real world and often helps to set you up for employment on graduation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The food industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, employing 4 million people and generating around £121 billion annually. The Scottish food and drink sector is worth around £14 billion each year and accounts for one in five manufacturing jobs. Scotland has 18,850 food and drink businesses, which employ around 115,400 people.</p>
<p>There are a number of challenges in the way we produce and consume food. How do we make sure that we produce food in a sustainable way in terms of its impact on the environment and climate change? How do we make sure that we produce healthy food that aids in reducing obesity and cardiovascular disease, including producing food that is low in salt, sugar and fat but which is still nutritious, safe and tastes good? The BSc (Hons) Food Science and Innovation at QMU, will give you the knowledge, skills and tools to find innovative solutions to these challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>On this course you will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>become more aware of the issues facing the food industry today and gain the knowledge, skills and tools to find innovative solutions to those challenges;</li>
<li>develop a sound understanding of the issues and concepts related to food science and the link between food science, nutrition and health;</li>
<li>have a detailed understanding of the important characteristics of food which enable the prediction of the safety, shelf life and acceptability of food products, and assess their nutritive values;</li>
<li>have detailed knowledge of the functionality of ingredients and their innovative use in the formulation and production of food products; and have developed practical skills in the evaluation of food with respect to composition, sensory, safety and nutritive value;</li>
<li>have experience of the nature and application of the legislation relevant for the food industry and consumer protection; and have practical experience of the monitoring, sampling and analysis of food when assessing safety standards and levels of permitted ingredients and contaminants;</li>
<li>apply the principles of quality and safety as applied to food provision, and become familiar and practised in the scientific principles and laboratory techniques used in the production, examination and analysis of food;</li>
<li>examine the systems legal and otherwise, which seek to control the production of food and protect the interests of the consumer, and foster an informed attitude to ethical and environmental concerns associated with food production;</li>
<li>develop the capacity for critical, analytical, reflective and independent thinking so that you become more of an effective problem solver and continuing learner both as a student and in your subsequent career;</li>
<li>develop experimental and practical skills and associated skills in design of investigations, data collection, analysis and reporting; and</li>
<li>understand the role of the food scientist within the food industry and professional and ethical conduct expected of a food scientist as set out by the Institute of Food Science and technology (IFST).</li>
