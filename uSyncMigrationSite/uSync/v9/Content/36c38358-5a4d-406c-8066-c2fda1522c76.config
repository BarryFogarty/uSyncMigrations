<p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (the Act) requires Scottish public authorities to produce and maintain a publication scheme. Authorities are under a legal obligation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>publish the classes of information that they make routinely available</li>
<li>tell the public how to access the information and what it might cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>QMU Enterprises Ltd adopted the Model Publication Scheme in 2015, as produced by the Scottish Information Commissioner.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://www.itspublicknowledge.info/publication-schemes" title="Publication schemes (Scottish Information Commissioner's website)">more information about this scheme on the Commissioner’s website</a> at or by contacting us at the address below.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Guide to Information is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow you to see what information is available (and what is not available) in relation to each class,</li>
<li>state what charges may be applied</li>
<li>explain how you can find the information easily</li>
<li>provide contact details for enquiries and to get help with accessing the information</li>
<li>explain how to request information we hold that has not been published</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Availability and formats </strong></p>
<p>The information we publish through the model scheme is, wherever possible, available on our website. We offer alternative arrangements for people who do not want to, or cannot, access the information online or by inspection at our premises. For example, we can usually arrange to send information to you in paper copy (although there may be a charge for this).</p>
<p><strong>Exempt information </strong></p>
<p>We will publish the information we hold that falls within the classes of information below. If a document contains information that is exempt under Scotland’s freedom of information laws (for example sensitive personal information or a trade secret), we may remove or redact the information before publication but we will explain why.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright </strong></p>
<p>Information obtained from this publication scheme cannot be copied or reproduced without formal permission. Such permission will usually be granted provided it is copied or reproduced accurately, is not used in a misleading context and provided that the source of the material is identified and the copyright status acknowledged.</p>
<p>The publication scheme may, however, contain information where the copyright holder is not Queen Margaret University. In most cases the copyright holder will be obvious from the documents. In cases where the copyright is unclear, however, it is the responsibility of the person accessing the information to locate and seek the permission of the copyright holder before reproducing the material or in any other way breaching the rights of the copyright holder. Wherever possible, this scheme will indicate where we do not own the copyright on documents within Section 12 – Classes of Information.</p>
<p>Information about Crown copyright material is available on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/queens-printer-for-scotland/" title="Queen's Printer for Scotland">Queen’s Printer for Scotland section of the Government website</a>. </p>
<p><span class="lead">Charges</span></p>
<p>This section explains when we may make a charge for our publications and how any charge will be calculated.</p>
<p>There is no charge to view information on our website or at our premises.</p>
<p>We may charge for providing information to you e.g., photocopying and postage, but we will charge you no more than it actually costs us to do so. We will always tell you what the cost is before providing the information to you.</p>
<p>Our photocopying charge per sheet of paper is shown in the table below:</p>
<p><strong>Black and white photocopying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Size of paper: A4</li>
<li>Pence per sheet of paper: 10 pence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Colour photocopying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Size of paper: A4</li>
<li>Pence per sheet of paper: 30 pence</li>
</ul>
<p>Information provided on CD-Rom will be charged at £5.00 per computer disc.</p>
<p>We will recharge any postage costs at the rate we paid to send the information to you.</p>
<p>When providing copies of pre-printed publications, we will charge no more than the cost per copy of the total print run.</p>
<p>We do not pass on any other costs to you in relation to our published information.</p>
<p>Please note that this charging schedule does not apply to our commercial publications (see Class 8 below). These items are offered for sale through retail outlets such as book shops, academic journal websites or museum shops and their price reflects a ‘market value’ which may include the cost of production.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Contact us </span></p>

<p>FOI</p>
<p>Queen Margaret University</p>

<p>Email: <a href="mailto:foi@qmu.ac.uk">foi@qmu.ac.uk </a></p>
<p>Tel: 0131 474 0000</p>
<p>We will also be pleased to advise you how to ask for information that we do not publish or how to complain if you are dissatisfied with any aspect of this publication scheme.</p>
<p><span class="lead">The classes of information that we publish </span></p>
<p>We publish information that we hold within the following classes. Once information is published under a class we will continue to make it available for the current and previous two financial years.</p>
<p>Where information has been updated or superseded, only the current version will be available. If you would like to see previous versions, you are welcome to make a request to us for that information.</p>]]></Value>
