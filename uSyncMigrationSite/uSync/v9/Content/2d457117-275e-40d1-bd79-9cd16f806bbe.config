<p><span class="lead"><strong>Study and <a data-id="3065" href="/{localLink:umb://document/71b99825061d4a2e8bd48daeb9d7cfe2}" title="Library">Learning Resource Centre</a></strong></span></p>
<p>As a student at QMU, you can expect to take responsibility for your own learning, with the support and guidance of academic staff, whilst developing the necessary skills to succeed academically. Courses are generally taught through lectures and small group tutorials, laboratory sessions or practicals (including placements), with a blend of continuous assessment and exams being used to gauge progress.</p>
<p>QMU’s £105 million campus opened in September 2007 takes full account of the needs of 21st century students and the specific requirements of our students. The campus is a vibrant academic village with high-tech buildings and attractive landscaped spaces, featuring an innovative learning resource centre (LRC) at the heart of the development.</p>
<p>The <a data-id="3065" href="/{localLink:umb://document/71b99825061d4a2e8bd48daeb9d7cfe2}" title="Library">LRC</a> and its facilities are an essential support to the learning, teaching and research activities at QMU. The LRC consists of a combined facility for directed and self-directed study, based on an integrated library and information service provision. We have 1,000 study spaces organised as a mixture of silent study, group study areas, bookable group study rooms, training rooms, assistive technology, student learning support and a postgraduate study room, network enabled for terminal or laptop access to electronic resources. Access to books and journals, electronic resources and audiovisual material to support learning, research and different modes of study are provided here. Many resources are accessible wherever and whenever you need to study. Staff in the LRC are committed to providing a service which is easy for all students to use and support is available at all times.</p>]]></Value>

<p>The city is never quiet. Its bustling atmosphere attracts people from all over the world and its entertainment and opportunities for fascinating cultural experiences are second to none.

<p><span class="lead"><strong>Up-to-date and relevant</strong> <strong>teaching</strong></span></p>

<p>As well as the involvement of teaching staff in research, we also have a <a data-id="1219" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d642254ee853449cbabd2bfe5c4c98e8}" title="Research and Knowledge Exchange">strong community of full-time researchers</a>, whose work is often cutting-edge. Again, this helps to ensure that the information being communicated through teaching is extremely progressive.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Research strengths</strong></span></p>
<p>As well as high-quality teaching, we have a strong reputation for our research excellence. Our research activity is internationally recognised, and informs and adds value to our teaching at all levels.</p>
<p><span class="lead"><strong>Enhancing quality of life and serving communities</strong></span></p>
