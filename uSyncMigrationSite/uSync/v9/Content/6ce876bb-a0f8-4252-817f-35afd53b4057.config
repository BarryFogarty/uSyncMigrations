      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The NHS vaccination centre is an NHS service and is run by NHS Lothian and not the University.<br />Your local NHS health board will be in touch with you to arrange your vaccination appointment when you are eligible. </p>
<p>You can read more about the vaccination programme in the Lothians at the <a href="https://www.nhslothian.scot/Coronavirus/Vaccine/Pages/default.aspx" title="NHS Lothian Vaccination Hub">NHS Lothian Vaccination Hub</a>.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Accessing QMU for Vaccinations</span></p>
<p>The vaccination centre at QMU is a drive-through service only. It will only service patients arriving in cars/vehicles who have been allocated an appointment.</p>
<p>Please do not visit the area of the vaccination centre before it is officially opened as construction work is underway. Once the site is up and running, it will be busy with traffic. We would ask that you do not visit the centre without an appointment, as you will not be given a vaccination.</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Queen Margaret University's Location</span></p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is located at Queen Margaret University Drive, Musselburgh, East Lothian (across the other side of the A1 from Fort Kinnaird Shopping Complex).</p>
<p><br /><span class="lead">Travelling to the University</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing the campus by vehicle - All main approach roads to the vaccination centre (whether approaching from East Lothian, the City Bypass, Midlothian or Edinburgh) will have clear signposting directing you to the vaccination centre at QMU.</li>
<li>Cars can access the campus via a slip road off the A1 southbound, between the exit for Newcraighall/Craigmillar and the Old Craighall Roundabout. Drivers should note that the access by car is not permitted via Whitehall Farm Road (by Musselburgh Station). On campus, there will be a designated route to the vaccination centre, which will be clearly signposted. You can also expect to see traffic marshalls who will help direct you into the through the vaccination centre.</li>
<li>Note about SatNav – please avoid using QMU’s postcode in SatNav as it will direct you via Musselburgh into the back of the QMU campus via Whitehall Farm Road and you will be unable to access the vaccination centre. The only approach road is via the A1.</li>
<li>Exiting campus by vehicle - there is only one exit which will take you back onto the southbound A1. You should follow the road to the Craighall Roundabout where you will be able to exit the A1 as necessary. The roundabout will allow connections to the east, west, south, into Edinburgh city centre and anywhere northbound.</li>
</ul>
