    "content": "<p>The current national agenda in the early years places considerable emphasis on raising the profile and quality of work undertaken in the sector, within education, health and care. The reform of the Children’s Workforce over the past decade has led to the need for highly qualified and motivated graduates with knowledge and understanding of the multi-disciplinary nature of working with young children and their families, as well as the importance of quality partnerships with parents and other agencies. This new course has been developed in response to that.</p>\n<p>Central to the course is an interdisciplinary approach, drawing in particular on education, health and welfare, sociology, psychology, geography, history, children’s rights, law and justice, political and economic science, anthropology, social policy and philosophy. The degree remains embedded within a socio-cultural perspective towards children, families and their wider communities with a guiding principle that is faithful to a child-centred approach.</p>\n<p>This course is designed to enable graduates to become confident, competent and critically reflective early years practitioners who meet the SSSC registration requirements for entry onto the register at manager/lead practitioner level.  The core philosophy of this course is the synthesis of theory and practice in order to ensure that graduates are able to reflect appropriately on practice within their settings and draw upon recent and relevant research to evaluate to drive forwards improvement. </p>"

    "content": "<p>Teaching and learning strategies are designed to facilitate the students’ ability to develop their own practice and confidence as managers/lead practitioners of early years settings, by using theoretical knowledge and concepts as reflective tools. This is achieved by: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Curriculum design and content that encourages the integration of theory and practice;</li>\n<li>High quality and regular contact between tutors and students;</li>\n<li>Work-based study in which students share and reflect on practice in informal ways during class time and formal ways during assignments;</li>\n<li>Assignments that support students in building their interpersonal skills as leaders and managers through a combination of individual and group work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modules will primarily adopt a workshop or seminar format, ensuring that staff and students are in regular one-to-one contact and working collectively as a reflective practitioner group. This ethos will be maintained during COVID restrictions through the safe blended approach (regulations allowing) which Fife College has already implemented. The workshop/seminar format will be complemented by some key lectures, guest speakers, and self-directed enquiry. Alongside the core classroom-based modules students are required to be continuing with their own specific early childhood practice and developing their confidence as managers/lead practitioners – supported and advised by an appointed mentor as required by the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC).</p>\n<p> As students are developing their own individual early childhood practice, the course also places emphasis on teamwork and collaborative skills. Students are responsible for their own time and assignment management, which encourages the development of efficient working practices and produces graduates who are confident and capable of coping with the pressures of management and leadership. The emphasis of the programme shifts from largely tutor-led and group learning in Level 9 to more independent learning in Level 10, including an independent practitioner research project.</p>"
