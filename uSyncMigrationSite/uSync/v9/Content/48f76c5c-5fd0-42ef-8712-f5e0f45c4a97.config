      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Although International Women’s Day was first celebrated in New York in 1909, it is the first time that it is being held at QMU. The women’s event has been commemorated in different ways across the globe – some have chosen to focus on the general celebration of respect, appreciation and love towards women, while others have shone the spotlight on economic, political and social achievements as well as social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The event, which will take place at QMU on Thursday 10th March 2016, involves a morning programme of talks by inspirational women from within QMU and outside the organisation, as well as networking sessions and lunch.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Petra Wend, Principal of QMU, explained: “It seems very fitting that staff and students at QMU take time out to celebrate women.</p>
<p>“Our main founders of the Edinburgh School of Cookery - Christian Guthrie Wright and Louisa Stevenson - were pioneers of their time. They were key figures in driving the UK wide mid-Victorian Women’s Movement, which campaigned for better education and improved career opportunities for females. Impressively, they were largely responsible for leading the campaign to secure the admission of females to Edinburgh University. Their drive, commitment and social conscience laid the foundation for what has become an ambitious higher education institution. Their legacy is a university which is driven by the highest ideals and purposes, and remains true to its values of opportunity for women and improving quality of life.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Wend continued: “QMU remains committed to gender equality and opportunity for all. We aim to be a university without borders and without barriers. Today, our female staff and students – be they lecturers, researchers, leaders, supporters, mothers, partners, carers – continue to achieve and inspire. I’d therefore like to encourage all staff and students – whatever their gender – to take part and contribute to International Women’s Day.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The QMU event is a collaboration between QMU’s Equality and Diversity Committee, a variety of QMU Departments (HR; Business, Enterprise and Management; [BEaM] and the Institute for Global Health and Development [IGHD]), QMU’s Students’ Union, UCU and Musselburgh Twinning Association.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">International Women’s Day will take place in the Piano Bar, Conference Suite and the Large Board Room at QMU from 10 am – 1.30 pm on Thursday 10th March 2016.  Lunch at 1 pm. Speakers will include QMU’s Principal, Professor Petra Wend; Heidi Vistisen, QMU Student President; Robyn Jancovich-Burns, Participant &amp; Industry Development Manager from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society and Louise McGurk from the Universities and Colleges Union Scotland. More speakers are still to be confirmed. Topics will cover leadership, career advancement and parity.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">To confirm your attendance at the event email Maria Terron Navarro, HR Administrator (<a href="mailto:mterronnavarro@qmu.ac.uk" class="txtMainTextLinks">mterronnavarro@qmu.ac.uk</a>)</p>
