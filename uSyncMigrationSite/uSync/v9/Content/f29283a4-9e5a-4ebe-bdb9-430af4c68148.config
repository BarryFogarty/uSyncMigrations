<li><strong>Flexible study options:</strong> We offer full-time, part-time and single module study options.</li>
<li><strong>An accessible route to a new career:</strong> This course has been designed in a way that allows students without a finance degree to apply but relevant accounting and finance working experience is preferred.</li>
<li><strong>Great location:</strong> QMU is located in the UK’s second largest financial centre. Not only does this pave the way for career opportunities on graduation, but also enables us to offer field trips and enlist guest speakers to enhance your learning experience.</li>
