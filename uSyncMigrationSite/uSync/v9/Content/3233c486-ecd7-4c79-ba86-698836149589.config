<ul>
<li><strong>You will be taught by experienced HCPC registered podiatrists alongside other staff who are professionally and research active in the NHS and private sector. Their applied research and professional links inform the teaching on the course, keeping it up to date with current developments in podiatry and podiatric practice.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn real-world podiatry skills on placements within an NHS setting and on other practice-based opportunities with the private and third sector.</strong></li>
<li><strong>QMU is ranked 1<sup>st</sup> among UK universities for Complementary Medicine (including Podiatry) (Complete University Guide 2023).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this course you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn from staff with an outstanding reputation for the quality of teaching.</li>
<li>Be equipped with all the knowledge and skills that you require to work as a podiatrist.</li>
<li>Develop your expertise through indepth theoretical learning, clinical placements in each year and the close support of our very experienced staff.</li>
<li>Benefit from the interprofessional working focus of this course. We aim for all our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a podiatrist you will be a healthcare professional who has been trained to diagnose and treat abnormal conditions of the feet and lower limbs. Podiatrists work with their patients to prevent and correct deformity, keeping people mobile and active, and helping to relieve pain. Podiatrists work with people of all ages, and your patients will count on you to support and help them with a broad range of mobility and medical conditions of the foot and lower limbs. These may include muscular and joint problems as well as broader health issues such as diabetes, blood disorders and disorders of the nervous system, which may involve complex wound management.</p>
<p>This is a four year integrated undergraduate master’s course. Students commence the course with a view to graduating with a Master of Podiatry (MPod) in four years and the eligibility to apply for registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). Years Three and Four will be taught alongside postgraduate students studying on the MSc Podiatry (Pre-Registration) course. There is also an option for students to choose a BSc (Hons) route at the end of year two and they will still be eligible to apply for registration with the HCPC as a podiatrist.</p>

Students who receive SAAS funding may be able to claim for some of these expenses to be reimbursed.</p>"
