By creating this active, open dialogue it aims to deepen both sides’ understanding of public issues.</p>\n<p>Sociological knowledge theory, analysis and social practice are directly connected to the experiences of particular ‘publics’, normally  understood as community groups, interest groups, campaigns or other civil society organisations. Public sociology is a discipline that speaks to, and for, udiences and communities beyond the parameters of the academic discipline and makes meaningful contributions to ongoing debates around public issues and concerns.</p>\n<p>This course offers you the opportunity to engage with diverse public groups and to reflect critically on how sociology can contribute to work for social justice and change. You will study what is distinctive about public sociology and the methods of engagement and research of the discipline.</p>\n<p>Public sociology is a contextual discipline responding to globalisation. The course draws on the experiences of public sociologists throughout the world and involves teaching by academics from a range of disciplines in which public sociology is relevant. Lecturers are engaged in research, education and activism with various public groups.</p>"
