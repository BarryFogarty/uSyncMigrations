      <Value><![CDATA[<p>THE GRAND OPENING was a star-studded affair, with double world champion frame runner Gavin<br>Drysdale, just 22 years old, leading the charge. He was joined by Glasgow Warriors players and the rugby<br>club's boss, Al Kellock – a former Scotland player and all-around legend.</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Frame Running is not just a sport; it&#x27;s a game changer for people with mobility challenges." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p>Formerly known as RaceRunning, it lets athletes experience the joy of free movement using purpose-built 'trikes' that support their bodies. No pedals, just pure foot power, with athletes steering with their hands or arms.</p>
<p><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work</strong></p>
<p>The hub is a result of a remarkable collaboration between QMU, Neil's Wheel Charity, Frame Running Scotland, ACE Frame Running, Scottish Athletics, and Scottish Disability Sport. It provides running frames and all the gear available for start-up clubs to hire for free, for up to two years. That's enough time to build a squad, raise funds, and maybe even collect some trophies. Plus, it's like a 'swap shop' for frame sizes – a win-win for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Research at QMU is providing the scientific evidence needed for Frame Running to be a part of future Paralympics. When the hub opened, there were ten active clubs across Scotland, and since then a new athletics club for Frame Running has opened in Annan, and another in Corstorphine. It’s great to know the<br>University is still having a positive impact on the part of Edinburgh we used to call home. Two more new clubs are due to follow soon.</p>
<p>Gavin Drysdale is a bit of a hero in athletics and his journey has come full circle. At just five years old, he got a leg up from Wooden Spoon's support of Bobath Scotland (now Cerebral Palsy Scotland) and became the first person in Scotland to rock a running frame at six years old. Now, he's a gold-winning sensation, defending his title at the Para Athletics World<br>Championships.</p>
<p>Gavin's excited about the hub, saying, </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="Frame Running has completely changed my life and now many more children with limited mobility will be given the chance to participate in sport and discover the joy of Frame Running like I did." source="" sourceExtra="" />
<p><br>Professor Marietta van der Linden is behind the research at QMU. She's exploring how Frame Running impacts individuals with conditions like cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. According to her, it goes beyond being just a sport; it's a transformative force for individuals with limited mobility.</p>
<p>Al Kellock, the Wooden Spoon hero and Managing Director of Glasgow Warriors, summed it up best: "The launch of Scotland's first Frame Running hub is a testament to the unifying power of sports."</p>]]></Value>
