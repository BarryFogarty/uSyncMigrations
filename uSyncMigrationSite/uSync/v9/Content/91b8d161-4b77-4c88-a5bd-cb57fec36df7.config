<ul>
<li><strong>You will enjoy a very high level of support and mentoring from our staff. We do not take as many students as some institutions, so you will enjoy a more individual and interactive learning experience.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We have excellent relationships with our clinical placement sites which allows us to support you constantly when you are on placement. You will be the only student on the team during your placements to give you the maximum possible benefit from the clinical experience.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will learn on specialist hi-tech facilities on campus. Our diagnostic imaging suite is equipped with a Siemens Multix Pro X Ray System, a Fuji Computerised Radiography system with high resolution digital workstations and a Fuji Direct Digital mobile.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We enjoy very high student satisfaction rates: there was 95% overall satisfaction with Diagnostic Radiography at QMU in the National Student Survey 2022.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/e33QBl3eobY" data-embed-height="346" data-embed-width="615" data-embed-constrain="false"><iframe width="615" height="346" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e33QBl3eobY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="What does a diagnostic radiographer do?"></iframe></div>
<p>On this course you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Learn from staff with an outstanding reputation for the quality of teaching.</li>
<li>Gain all the knowledge and skills that you require to work as a diagnostic radiographer. </li>
<li>Develop your expertise through in-depth theoretical learning, clinical placements each year and the close support of our very experienced staff.</li>
<li>Benefit from the interprofessional working focus of this course. We aim for all our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member. </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic radiographers are healthcare professional who acquire and evaluate images of the human body to diagnose disease and trauma. They use a range of high-technology imaging equipment and techniques and work closely with the multidisciplinary team to provide a person-centred service.</p>
<p>Radiography is invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and trauma. As a diagnostic radiographer your skill, judgement and professionalism will be a vital part of a team’s clinical work, and affect patients’ lives, day after day. Awaiting a diagnosis can be a stressful time for patients and in this career you must be technically adept, an excellent communicator and provide person-centred care. This is why our diagnostic radiography course places high importance on clinical placements. Placements are essential to build self-confidence, practice radiographic techniques and develop clinical knowledge in a real-life hospital setting.</p>
<p>This is a four year integrated undergraduate master’s course. Students commence the course with a view to graduating with a Master of Radiography: Diagnostic (MDRad) in four years and the eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC. Years Three and Four will be taught alongside postgraduate students studying on the MSc Diagnostic Radiography (Pre-Registration) course. There is an option for students to choose a BSc (Hons) route at the end of Year Two and they will still be eligible to apply for registration with the HCPC as a diagnostic radiographer.</p>
