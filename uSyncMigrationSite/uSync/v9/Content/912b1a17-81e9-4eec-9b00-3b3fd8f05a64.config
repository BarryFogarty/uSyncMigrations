      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>How to enter</strong></p>
<p>Entering the competition couldn’t be simpler. Complete and submit the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkLmVPq5YPjfZCUGz9Sx4JuJXnxn62cDTHDuFrhdWvOJHWPg/viewform" target="_top">APPLICATION FORM</a> including a link to your two-minute video (and password if appropriate). The closing date for applications is 17.00 on Monday 2nd March.</p>
<p>The competition is open to QMU students, recent graduates and tenants of QMU's Business Innovation Zone. Entries are welcome from individuals or teams. (If you’re part of a team, only one person will take part in the Q&amp;A on the day.)</p>
<p>Entries will be considered by a panel (QMU’s Business Development Manager, Miriam Smith, Steven Newlin, a Business Gateway advisor and Rebecca Muir from East Lothian Food and Drink Business Improvement District (BID)) who will select the four finalists to pitch their idea on 17 March.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The panel is looking for unique ideas that have been well thought through; ideas that are innovative, creative and viable, and evidence that you have done your research. The videos will be judged on originality, creativity, effectiveness, relevance and clarity. </p>
<p>Ideas can be food and drink related in the broadest way encompassing events, tourism, communications and so on.  </p>
<p><strong>Filming Your Pitch</strong></p>
<p>Please upload your final video to YouTube (this can be set to private with a passcode), and the link (and password, if applicable) must be added to your application form prior to submission.</p>
<p>The film of your pitch is the key part of your application and if you are a finalist, your film will be shown at the event. With this in mind, we’d recommend that you use a HD video camera. If you use a smartphone, please remember to turn your phone round and film it in landscape! The video should be created by yourself or in collaboration with other QMU students/staff/alumni. Remember to narrate or subtitle your film in English. Your video should be two minutes long. </p>
<p><strong>Resources to help you with your entry</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creating the perfect pitch</strong><br />Useful resources include Simon Sinek and his popular TED Talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA" title="Youtube - External site">Start with Why</a></p>
<p><strong>Business Model Canvas</strong><br />The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas" target="_blank">Business Model </a>Canvas is a standard start up template for developing new business ideas. It is a visual chart with elements describing a product’s value proposition, infrastructure, customers and finances. It will help you clarify how your idea might become a sustainable business. </p>]]></Value>

    <introduction>
      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tuesday 17 March 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately the event “Food for the Future with Prue Leith” that was due to take place at Queen Margaret University on Tuesday 17<sup>th</sup> March 2020 will no longer be going ahead.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The book launch that Prue was attending in Edinburgh next week has been postponed and as a result the decision has been taken to postpone the QMU event to a later date to tie in with the rearranged book launch.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>When a new date is agreed we will be in contact to advise of details.</strong></p>
<p>We’re delighted to announce that QMU Chancellor Prue Leith will join us for another entrepreneurial event. Prue Leith will share her views on the challenges facing the food and drink industry before introducing the main event, a pitching competition where four finalists, enterprising members of the QMU community (students and recent graduates), who have an innovative food or drink idea (pre-start or early stage) can win cash prizes. After a Q &amp; A session with a panel of experts the audience will vote for the winners. Think Strictly without the dancing.</p>]]></Value>
