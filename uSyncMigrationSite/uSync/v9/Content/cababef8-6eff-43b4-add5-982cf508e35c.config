<p><span class="lead">Method</span><br />To ensure safety from COVID-19, the research was conducted online. To maximise flexibility, participants were offered a range of ways to take part:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom interviews</li>
<li>Writing or drawings</li>
<li>Voice recordings</li>
</ul>
<p>Many children had support from adults to take part, while others took part on their own.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Who took part?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>35 children of colour, living in Scotland.</li>
<li>Participants aged 9 months-15 years, with an average age of 9 years old.</li>
<li>57% identified as male, 43% as female.</li>
<li>Participants mainly lived in Edinburgh area postcodes. The majority of participants lived in areas identified as SIMD* quintile 1 (most deprived 20%) and 2 (20-40% most deprived).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />*The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is a relative measure of deprivation across 6,976 small areas (called data zones). If an area is identified as ‘deprived’, this can relate to people having a low income but it can also mean fewer resources or opportunities.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Overarching recommendations from children: </span></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation One: </strong>People in power should learn about racism and take an active role in fighting racism.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Two: </strong>People in power should invest in services, to support children of colour and their communities to thrive. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Three: </strong>People in power should fight COVID.</p>
