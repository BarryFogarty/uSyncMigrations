<p>ReBUILD for Resilience examines health systems in fragile settings experiencing violence, conflict, pandemics and other shocks. Our aim is to produce high-quality, practical, multidisciplinary and scalable health systems research which can be used to build health systems resilience and improve the health and lives of many millions of people. For more information, please visit the <a href="https://www.rebuildconsortium.com/the-challenge/">project website</a>. ReBUILD for Resilience is an <a href="https://www.rebuildconsortium.com/partners/">international consortium</a> of organisations from Lebanon, Myanmar, Nepal, Sierra Leone and the UK. Between us we have expertise across all health systems pillars and in a wide range of disciplines including public health, epidemiology, social sciences, health economics, political science, research methodologies and gender. The consortium is building on the work started during the highly successful <a href="https://www.rebuildconsortium.com/building-on-rebuild/">ReBUILD programme</a> but is focusing on a wider range of stressors in a wider range of contexts – fragile and shock-prone (FASP) settings. The consortium has been active since 2020 and is funded by a £7.68 million grant from the UK government’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.</p>

<p>Jordan, Lebanon, Syria<br />2016 - Present<br />With the American University Beirut and UNRWA. This project explores key vulnerabilities of UNRWA health systems in the face of disruptions associated with the displacement of Palestine refugees registered in Syria. The research aims to identify strategies to strengthen health system resilience in contexts of protracted displacement. This research project is funded by Elrha's Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises R2HC Programme. The R2HC Programme is funded equally by the Wellcome Trust and Department for International Development with Elrha overseeing the programmes execution and management.</p>
<p><strong><span class="lead">NIHR Research Unit on Health in Situations of Fragility (RUHF)</span><br /></strong></p>
<p>Lebanon, Sierra Leone, El Salvador<br /><span>2017- Present<br />The NIHR Research Unit on Health in Situations of Fragility (RUHF) at QMU focuses on contexts where displacement, conflict, pandemic disease or weak capacity makes the delivery of health services especially challenging. Although its work seeks to be of wide relevance to the delivery of healthcare in situations of fragility, RUHF especially focuses on two vital but commonly neglected areas of health provision in these contexts: mental health and psychosocial support, and the treatment and prevention of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  RUHF researchers at QMU's Institute of Global Health and Development (IGHD) work closely with its collaborative partners - the Global Health Institute, American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon, and the College of Medicine &amp; Allied Health Science (COMAHS), Freetown Sierra Leone.  </span></p>

<p>Georgia<br />2017 - 2022</p>
<p>Founder: The project is funded through the Joint Health Systems Research Initiative which is jointly funded by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development">Department of International Development (DFID)</a>, the <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/">Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)</a>, the <a href="https://www.mrc.ac.uk/">Medical Research Council (MRC)</a> and the <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust (WT).</a></p>
<p>Partners: The Results4TB research project is a partnership between <a href="http://curatiofoundation.org/">Curatio International Foundation</a>, Queen Margaret University, the <a href="https://www.itg.be/">Institute of Tropical Medicine (Antwerp)</a> and <a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/">The London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine</a>.

<p>Georgia has a high burden of tuberculosis, with almost 1 in a thousand people becoming infected in 2015. Despite improvements in TB detection and treatment, the Georgian treatment success rates remain low which shows that many people may not be completing treatment, posing a threat to their own health as well as that of their families and communities. Although the Georgian government has introduced incentives for patients to encourage continuous treatment, adherence remains low. Therefore, new results-based financing incentive scheme has been introduced with an aim to motivate health service providers, thus improving patient adherence and treatment outcomes. Results4TB is helping to develop the pilot intervention with policy makers and programme managers and provide evidence of its impact and cost-effectiveness. The project will make suggestions for fine-tuning and modification if the RBF scheme is to be rolled out nationally in Georgia. Results4TB will provide valuable evidence on a health systems intervention for TB, and will contribute to a better understanding of RBF for practitioners, donors and researchers.

<p><span class="lead">Exploring approaches for complementary private sector engagement in the health sector in Northern Syria  </span></p>
<p>Syria<br />2021 - 2022</p>
<p>Founder: UOSSM France</p>
<p>Partners: <a href="https://www.uossm.fr/">UOSSM France</a></p>
<p>In collaboration with UOSSM France, this project aimed to explore sustainable and long-term approaches to health service provision by investigating the role of the private sector in the provision of health services in Northern Syria. After a successful first phase, the project is now extended until August 2022 to assess service utilization among community members in Northern Syria across different health providers. This second phase would generate evidence on the main sources of healthcare in the region and the interaction of communities with different sectors to address their health needs. More details about this project are available <a href="https://www.rebuildconsortium.com/projects/private-sector-health-syria/">here</a>.</p>
