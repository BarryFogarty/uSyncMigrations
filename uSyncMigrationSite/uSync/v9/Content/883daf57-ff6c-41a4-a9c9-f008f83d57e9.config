    "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong> <br /><br />During your first two years, you’ll join a diverse cohort of students, exploring the fundamental principles of dietetics and gain hands-on practice experience through placement-based learning within health and social care.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will move on to either the BSc (Hons) or the undergraduate master’s pathway depending on your aspirations and performance. Both pathways develop professional skills, knowledge and attributes through a combination of university and placement-based learning. The undergraduate master’s offers an opportunity to delve deeper into areas such as leadership, service improvement, research and public health, at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Upon graduation, both pathways lead to eligibility for registration with the HCPC, opening doors to a fulfilling career in dietetics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/study-here/undergraduate-study/undergraduate-masters-courses/\">Find out about the benefits of studying an undergraduate master’s.</a><br /><br /><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong> <br /><br />You will be taught in face-to-face or online lectures, seminars, practical workshops and laboratories. Outside timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning through self-study. You will be assessed by a variety of assessment methods (eg written and practical exams, case studies, written assignments and presentations) at the end of each module or semester. <br /><br /><strong>Placements (Practice-Based Learning)</strong><br /><br />There are practice-based learning opportunities in Years Two, Three and Four, amounting to a minimum of 1000 hours of practice-based learning (150 hours in Year Two and 450 hours in both Years Three and Four). <br /><br />QMU manages the sourcing and allocation of placements for each student on this course in partnership with health boards in Scotland and other universities in Scotland that deliver dietetic education. In Years Three and Four placements are randomly allocated to students as part of a Scottish wide allocation process. <br /><br />To enhance future employability, placements take place across Scotland. It is therefore likely that students will have to relocate for at least one of their 12-week practice-based learning blocks in Year Three or Year Four of the course, unless they have individual requirements (eg specific health needs or school age children) that means they must remain in a specific location.  <br /><br /><strong>Specialist facilities</strong> <br /><br />QMU offers a variety of modern specialist spaces for our Dietetics courses. Students have access to chemistry and microbiology laboratories for practical science-based classes along with a fully equipped teaching kitchen and sensory suite for food based classed.  Practical rooms and a simulated ward environment are utilised for teaching and development of clinical skills. In addition students have access to appropriate equipment for completing nutritional and dietary assessments that are incorporated into teaching across all years of the course QMU also has an allotment/community garden and students can also access and become involved in the community garden activities.</p>\n<p>You can view films on our specialist facilities further down this page in the 'Specialist facilities films' tab.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
