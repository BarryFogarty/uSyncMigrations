    "content": "<p>Dr Taner Doğan's research centres on the nexus of communication, politics, and religion, with a particular emphasis on the Middle East and North Africa. He is interested in the rise of digital media in the contemporary world and its interconnection with thinking, creating a digital culture that influences the (trans)formation of identity. The role of technology and the impact of neoliberalism are important areas of focus in Dr Doğan's research.</p>\n<p>Dr Doğan’s doctorate examines the political communication strategies of Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Drawing on approaches to political communication and social movement theories, it analyses the transformations that have taken place within the AKP. The research, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, identify two distinct policy periods. </p>\n<p>The first, from 2002 to 2009, was characterized by a liberal political ideology, where AKP embraced human rights, freedom of speech, and the rule of law. Then, the post-2010 era, where a shift towards a populist discourse emerged, which, in retrospect, has problematized the objectives of Turkey’s democratization process. It also highlights the implications of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's authoritarian one-man rule and the consequent deinstitutionalization of the state. </p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Active Research Interests: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital culture</li>\n<li>Religion</li>\n<li>Political communication</li>\n<li>Cultural Studies</li>\n<li>Populism</li>\n<li>Technology and Society</li>\n<li>Visual art</li>\n<li>Middle East and North Africa</li>\n<li>Turkey</li>\n<li>Egypt</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Research Methods:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elite interviews</li>\n<li>Ethnography</li>\n<li>Focus groups</li>\n<li>Content Analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Research Centres:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full member of <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/03785f08f50a4001abf6a1516aff240d}\" title=\"Centre for Communication, Cultural and Media Studies\">The Centre for Communication, Cultural and Media Studies</a></li>\n</ul>"
