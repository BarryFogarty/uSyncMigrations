      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why attracted you to study in Edinburgh and why did you choose QMU? </strong></p>
<p><span>For me, proximity to the Scottish Borders was important and out of the universities that were local to me, I had heard good things about QMU and its reputation. </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>What interested you about your chosen course? Tell us about progressing from GD ICN to the Pg Dip PCP DN.  </strong></p>
<p><span>Having been out of education for over five years and knowing I wanted to complete the Pg Dip PCP DN course, I knew I required something academic to get onto the course. The GD ICN had been announced and I had the opportunity to take this on as a steppingstone to secure entry to the Pg Dip PCP DN course. I knew the modules available through GD ICN would improve my learning going forward.</span> </p>
<p><strong>What have you most enjoyed about your course? What has been the highlight? </strong></p>
<p><span>I have enjoyed learning about being Person-Centred within my role and gaining knowledge of the Person-Centred Framework. The modules all had a very positive impact on my nursing career. Gaining knowledge of palliative care, long-term conditions and obtaining my V300 at Level 10 was a great professional achievement for me. </span> </p>
<p><strong>Have you participated in a course activity you found especially interesting? </strong></p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Quote" text="The St Colombus Hospice was very interesting to me. The Palliative Care module was delivered online but as part of the Person-Centred District Nursing course, I got to meet the lecturers and staff from St Columbus hospice face to face. I found this very beneficial as it was casual but informative. I really liked being able to listen to the experiences of other nurses but also about new methods of caring for palliative patients." source="Sarah Hope" sourceExtra="" />
<p><strong>How have your lecturers supported your learning? </strong></p>
<p><span>The lecturers have been very supportive throughout, especially when the GD ICN was an online course.</span> </p>
<p><strong>What have been some of your challenges with the course and university life? How have you overcome them? </strong></p>
<p><span>Completing the GD ICN during COVID meant there were a lot of challenges to overcome, particularly in relation to completing the course on time. However, I was grateful for a supportive team that enabled study time especially due to restrictions and reduced staff during COVID.</span> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in applying for this course? </strong></p>
<p><span>I would fully encourage applying for the GD ICN course as all the modules are important for nurses wishing to better their individual skills and enhance there knowledge to provide person-centred nursing and to also prescribe relevant medication to individuals requiring medical care safely and timely. </span> </p>]]></Value>
