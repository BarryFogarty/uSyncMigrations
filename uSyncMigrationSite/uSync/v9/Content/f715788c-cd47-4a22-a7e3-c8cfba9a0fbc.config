      <Value><![CDATA[<p>This course focuses on the intersection of communication, media, and politics as the area of knowledge fundamental for communicators working across public, private and third-sector organizations as well as a range of economic, social or cultural sectors. Students will develop communication expertise that combines strategic communication with an understanding of policy communication in the contemporary media landscape. The course offers relevant theoretical knowledge and strong vocational skills development for students who wish to enter careers in public affairs, policy communication, campaigning, or advocacy jobs.</p>
<p>Communication, media, and culture not only shape people’s lives but are also pivotal to the way in which politics and policymaking work. Companies and brands have recognised this for some time now in their lobbying, advocacy, and social responsibility work. In this age of activism, so have ordinary people when they mobilize to advocate for ways—laws and policies—to change how governments and companies go about their business. There is politics (and policy) in the food we eat, in the education we get, in how we travel, how we build homes, in who makes our clothes and what happens to them when we no longer use them. And this is what this course is about.</p>
