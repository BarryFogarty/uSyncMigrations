      <Value><![CDATA[<p>I love the term “Mature student”.</p>
<p>My wife said to me when I was accepted as a direct entry “It will be funny; you’ll be a mature student”. The reason we found this so funny is there is very little that’s mature about me. I still listen to the same pop punk bands I listened to when I was fourteen, I still refuse the notion that I’m too old to be in a nightclub during the week and still feel as young as I did when I left school. So why am I a mature student?</p>
<p>Well firstly I’m eight years older that most in my class, I ask more questions than I probably should and I sit in the front row just to make sure I don’t miss anything! Jokes aside though I feel like I enjoy University more than I ever have. By being able to relate a lot of what I learn to real life experiences I have had I enjoy it a lot more than I did previously.</p>
<p>But how will this mature student go and live somewhere abroad with so many commitments at home in Edinburgh…</p>
<p>The reason all this exchange talk happened in the first place was the simple. I asked myself the question all third years ask themselves, or really should ask themselves…” What I am going to write my dissertation on?”.</p>
<p>Luckily I had been thinking about this for a while. Being lucky enough to work in the social service sector I decided I will incorporate my work into my studies. Why ignore a wealth of experience and potential research opportunities that I am exposed too for sixteen hours a week? It was decided. I will be writing my dissertation on disability rights amongst the people of Edinburgh in relation to the job market.</p>
<p>But wait, why stop at Edinburgh? Could I carry out research in Glasgow, or London, or…. The United States? Surely not. The home of the disability rights movement in the 1970s. That would be too good.</p>
<p>Well turns out it wasn’t too good, it was possible.</p>
<p>But how easy would this be…</p>]]></Value>
