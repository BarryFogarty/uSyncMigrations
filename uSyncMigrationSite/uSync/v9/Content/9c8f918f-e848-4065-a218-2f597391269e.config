<ul>
<li><strong>A history of experience and success:</strong> Our teaching draws upon a vast experience and legacy of successfully preparing students for entry into the field of professional performance - there are QMU graduates in most of the major theatre and performance institutions in Scotland, and, of course, many have gone on to successful careers further afield.</li>

    "content": "<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>All students enrol onto the honours degree, but you can choose to exit with an ordinary degree after three years.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>The course adopts a blended learning approach and workshops are the primary form of student-staff contact, with students engaging in practical activities facilitated or supervised by the lecturers, either individually or in groups. Peer teaching is enabled through the use of seminar presentations, and collaborative devising or workshop generation processes. Students are encouraged to be enquiring, critical and innovative. In addition, students also initiate and lead individual tutorials/workshops with members of staff related to coursework or dissertation supervision.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>\n<p>Our fully resourced studio theatre and smaller black box studio are fully kitted out with sound, lighting, and projection equipment for your use. In addition we have a scenic workshop for building sets and props, a scenography studio for set design, and a costume studio and store. You will have access to five bookable rehearsal studios (two with sprung floors), as well as to our dance studio and gym hall.</p>\n<p>Media resources include access to our edit and post-production suites, our infinity green screen studio, and equipment including cameras, photographic equipment, VR and motion capture kit.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements</strong></p>\n<p>You are offered the opportunity for industry-based learning through placement opportunities in the module Drama in Education and also if you elect to take the Experiential Learning Placement.</p>\n<p>Industry-based learning can occur in a diversity of areas (community and youth theatre organisations, schools, arts organisations, charities and community groups). Our links with external stakeholders continue to grow and develop. Examples of placement opportunities range from the Edinburgh International Festival to working with independent theatre companies or the Brunton or Lyceum theatres as well as a range of local primary and secondary schools. The mix of student placements is very diverse and we aim to accommodate all student aspirations.</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>Studying abroad through our exchange programme can be one of the most exciting and rewarding challenges for a student to experience. The opportunity to travel and live in another country, learn different customs and traditions, meet new people and future career draws many students into the exchange programme.</p>\n<p>In Year Three you have the opportunity (subject to availability) to study for one semester at a university overseas. Please visit the <a href=\"/study-here/international-students/exchanges-and-study-abroad/\"><strong>Exchanges and Study Abroad</strong></a> pages for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff, class sizes and timetables</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
