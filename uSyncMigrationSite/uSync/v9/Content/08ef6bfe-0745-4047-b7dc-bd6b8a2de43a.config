<p>Currently, I am working as a Front Office Associate at Hotel Ambassador. I am so grateful that I have been hired in this challenging time where, due to COVID, some people struggle to hold on to their jobs.</p>
<p><span class="lead"> Anything else you’d like to share about life as a student or graduate?</span></p>
<p>You will likely face many ups and downs in the hospitality industry, and the struggle is real. Sometimes you might even start to question if it is worth it, and believe me; everyone has gone through that phase. The only thing I would say is don’t lose hope – right now, we might not be having the best time of our lives, but eventually, our hard work will pay off.</p>

      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Student name: Prerisha Tamrakar</p>
<p>Course: BA (Hons) International Hospitality and Tourism Management</p>
<p>Hometown: Panauti-6, Kavre</p>
<p>Year of graduation: 2022</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why did you choose to study at one of QMU's partner institutions, and what attracted you to the course?</span> </p>
<p>I was always passionate about the hospitality industry. With considerable research, I learned about the Silver Mountain School of Hotel Management. The practical and theoretical learning provided by Silver Mountain attracted me to join them. The college's affiliation with Queen Margaret University was a real bonus with a standardised learning module throughout the world. Furthermore, the college had top-notch practical labs that intrigued me even more, and the teachers who conducted my interview were also highly qualified, making me believe that I was in safe hands. </p>
<p><span class="lead">What did you enjoy most about your course?</span></p>
<p>During my four years with Silver Mountain, I was able to gain various skills. Beginning with the practical lessons that prepared me for my career in the hospitality industry. Furthermore, we organised multiple trips and theme parties, which were fun yet knowledgeable, and those experiences felt like a real-life job. However, my most cherished moments would have to be when I went to Dubai for the Horse World cup in 2019, where I got a chance to work for the event, and also the memories that I shared with my friends throughout my time on the course. </p>
<p><span class="lead">Were there any particular course activities you found especially interesting? </span></p>
<p>It sounds odd, but I loved doing assignments. I used to enjoy making PowerPoints and giving presentations. It boosted my confidence every time, and I could see myself growing and gradually improving. </p>
<p><span class="lead">Do you have any advice for students who might be interested in this course?</span></p>
<p>If you are passionate about the hospitality industry, don't listen to what others have to say. Listen to yourself and go for it! You won't get a high-paid job right away, and you might start from a low-level position, but trust me, there are various opportunities out there in the hospitality industry that have so much to offer and, of course, potential career growth.</p>]]></Value>
