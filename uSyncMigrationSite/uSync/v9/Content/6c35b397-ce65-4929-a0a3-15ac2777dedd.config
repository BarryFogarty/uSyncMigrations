<p><span class="lead-big">What our students say</span></p>
<p><strong>This new course builds on the success of our established PGDE in Home Economics and shares core modules with that course. Here are some of things students and graduates of that course have to say about their experience of studying at QMU. </strong></p>
<p> “I have enjoyed learning about the profession of teaching and how teachers can carry out research to develop their subject and keep up-to-date with new ways of thinking, trends and technology.” <strong>Karen Dorrat</strong></p>
<p> “The staff at Queen Margaret were so approachable, supportive and interested in each and every student. They all want to help you progress and support you in reaching your goals. The staff always seemed accessible to students..It is that small family vibe and attitude to student support which sets QMU apart from other universities in my opinion.” <strong>Ryan Lee</strong></p>
<p>“I was interested in research around the topic of inclusion and additional support needs, and particularly enjoyed the practical elements on campus. I also gained a huge amount of classroom-based experience by completing both school placements.” <strong>Joanna Jarvis</strong></p>
<p>“The lecturers were fantastic in their support of students - always being there to listen to any concerns, and sharing their opinions and strategies to help guide students through the course. Lecturers were keen to push us to the best of our abilities, and provided many opportunities for us to learn.” <strong>Kirsten Stewart</strong></p>
<p> “I’ve enjoyed so many parts of the course, as they all offered different perspectives and angles of teaching - I can’t believe how much I’ve learnt in the last year!” <strong>Gabrielle Jondet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Become your best you: study at QMU</strong></p>

You will complete an 18-week placement in two different secondary schools in Scotland.</p>\n<p>Placements are generated through the GTCS Student Placement System (SPS) and are based on a student’s term time address. Students may be required to travel within a 90 minutes radius to their placement. Under no circumstances should students source their own placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>This is a full-time, demanding course, lasting 36 weeks in total, split into 18 weeks of campus teaching and online learning and 18 weeks on placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>The expected class size for this PGDE will be up to approximately 20 students.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.
