<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor Brendan McCormack, Head of Division at Queen Margaret University, is considered to be a global authority on person-centred healthcare, quality improvement and the care of older people. He will be giving his professorial lecturer at the University on Tuesday 9th February 2016.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">In recent years, nursing has been criticised for not demonstrating enough compassion, care and kindness in everyday practice, as well as challenged for not putting the needs of patients and families at the centre of its decision-making. Professor McCormack believes that in order to effect real and lasting change, organisations must embrace the values of ‘respect’ for all those striving in their daily work to ‘be the best that they can be’. The Professor said: “Only a collaborative, inclusive and participative approach will allow contemporary nursing to achieve excellence and transform.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">Professor McCormack considers that huge advances have been made in creating environments that are truly respectful of people as individuals. He said: “Being person-centred requires the formation of meaningful relationships between professionals, service users and their families/carers. To develop a healthcare system where nurses perform at the highest levels we need to create conditions which enable individuals, teams and institutions to flourish. People who are flourishing function at extraordinary high levels – they are energised, engaged and committed – all key qualities that nurses need in order to deliver effective person-centred care.”</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">This lecture will address the opportunity for transformation across the health sector and the challenge for nursing to operate within the constraints of rules, regulations and the straight-jacket of bureaucracy. </p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The event will appeal to professionals working in nursing and healthcare, as well as members of the public who are interested in the future of health services in the UK.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">In 2014, Professor McCormack was listed in the Thomson Reuters 3000 most influential researchers globally. In the same year, he was honoured in the Sigma Theta Tau International (STTI) 2014 International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame awards. In 2015, he was recognised as an ‘Inspirational Nursing Leader’ by The Nursing Times (UK nursing journal) and was made a fellow of the Royal College of Nursing.</p>
<p>‘Achieving Excellence in Care: Dancing with Beauty Rather than Fighting Ugliness’ takes place on Tuesday 9th February 2016, 5.30pm for a 6pm start at Queen Margaret University , Queen Margaret University Drive, Musselburgh, EH21 6UU.</p>
<p class="txtMainBlack">The lecture is free but booking is essential.</p>]]></Value>
