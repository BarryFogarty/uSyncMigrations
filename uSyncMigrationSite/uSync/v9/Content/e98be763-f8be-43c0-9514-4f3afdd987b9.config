Here you will be able to: add an email address, link to Facebook and/or Twitter, upload a picture of yourself, add information about yourself, and adjust privacy options. Select Submit to save any changes you make.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Add an email address</strong></span></p>\n<p><br />When you first access Edit My Blackboard Profile you will be asked to provide a <strong>Primary Email Address</strong>. This can be your QMU email or a personal email address – it is your choice.</p>\n<p>Blackboard will use the email address you enter to verify your profile account and<strong> you need to respond to the</strong> <strong>email from Blackboard in order for the profile to be accepted</strong> (e.g. you will not be able to upload a photo or add any profile information if you do not verify the email address you provide). One benefit of providing a personal email address is that this would provide a point of future contact should you leave the University. <strong>Please note:</strong> whichever email address you provide, it will have no impact on emails sent from your module areas in the Hub, which will always be sent to your QMU email address. (You can change your Primary email address at any time using the Contact Information field at the bottom of the Edit My Blackboard Profile page</p>\n<p>[image of blackboard login]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Link to Facebook or Twitter</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>If you have Facebook and/or Twitter accounts, you can create links to these in order to pull information across to your Blackboard profile. For example, when linking to Facebook you can choose whether to copy across your Facebook picture, description and email – or if you prefer, you can select to Connect With Facebook without copying any of these across.</p>\n<p>If you have a Twitter account you can select to copy across your Twitter picture and description – or just Connect with Twitter without copying these across.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>When linking to Facebook and Twitter you will be asked to authorise the Blackboard Cloud services access to your accounts by providing your usual Facebook/Twitter username and password. Access is limited; for example, if linking to Twitter, visitors to your profile will be able to read any tweets from your timeline and see who you follow, but viewers will not be able to: follow new people on your behalf, update your profile, posts tweets for you, access your direct messages, or see your password.</p>\n<p>If you choose to link to Facebook and/or Twitter, tutors and students at QMU will be able to access your Facebook and Twitter profile pages by selecting the appropriate icon when viewing your Blackboard Profile Card:</p>\n<p>[image of blackboard profile card]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>You can choose to <strong>Unlink your Facebook or Twitter</strong> profile at any time by selecting the appropriate icon in Edit My Blackboard Profile and selecting <strong>Unlink.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Upload a picture of yourself</strong></span></p>\n<p><br />To upload a picture, select the picture icon and browse for your picture. Please note: images must be less than five megabytes in size, and at least 50x50 pixels in dimension. Although it appears that different photo formats can be used, the format currently MUST be .png (portable network graphic). Any picture you upload will be visible in all of your module areas – in most cases it will only be visible to you, but if you use discussion forums then your picture will appear in these and you will also be able to see pictures of others (if they have uploaded one). You can change your picture at any time – just go to Edit My Blackboard Profile and select Change Picture, then select Upload New and search for your picture.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Information about you</span></p>\n<p><br />You can choose how you want your name to be displayed and you can also enter any information you wish to share about yourself in the text box provided.

The following Privacy Options control who can search and browse for you on the People page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My School (recommended) – enables sharing across the institution (e.g. your picture will be visible in the People area);</li>\n<li>Private – restricts sharing of your profile with module users only (e.g. your picture will be visible in discussion forums within your modules);</li>\n<li>Hidden – your profile is not shared with anyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Overview</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>This page provides the current date, links to the calendar, and shows a list of any discussion posts students have contributed to, as well as responses from peers and tutors.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard]</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Posts</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>This page presents a list of any discussion posts students have contributed to, as well as responses from peers and tutors. Selecting a thread and then the name of the discussion forum enables you to move directly to that forum.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> you should still visit discussion pages within module areas to ensure you do not miss out on the full range of discussion fora available. Blogs and journal postings will also be displayed here.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard]</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\"> Updates</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>New updates are highlighted by a red box with a number (indicating the number of new updates). The red box is visible at the top of the Hub interface screen as well as within the Global Navigation menu.</p>\n<p>Any courses (modules) with updates are listed on the Updates page as live links. There is also a breakdown of All updates with details of how many hours or days ago the update was made and options to Open or Dismiss. Once you have viewed the Updates page, the red box will disappear from view (re-appearing when future updates are available). It is possible to view updates for each individual module as well as all updates. Please note: the system is set by default to remove updates that have been visible for more than five days.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The tool for customising notifications about updates can be accessed using the ‘cog’ icon from the top- right corner of the Updates page.</p>\n<p>Here you can select to <strong>Show/Hide Notifications</strong>, or to go to <strong>View Notification Settings</strong> if you wish to edit these settings (see section 3.4 for full details). This will reduce the number of alerts you receive.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard - Show/Hide Notifications] </p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Retention Centre</span></p>\n<p>This function is currently unavailable – please ignore this area.

You can also provide start and end times.</p>\n<p>To view the calendar there are three options: day, week, and month. You can also choose whether to show all calendars or just selected ones. If you enter a date/time incorrectly just click on the event and drag to the correct date (students are only able to move personal events).</p>\n<p>There is the facility to create a link which you can import into other calendar applications – just select <strong>Get External Calendar Link</strong> and copy the web link (URL) that appears. Next go to your email account (e.g. Outlook) and in the email account settings select and paste the web link into the <strong>New Internet Calendar Subscription</strong> within the <strong>Internet Calendars</strong> tab (this can be found by going to File then <strong>Account Settings/Account Settings</strong> in Outlook email).</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> this will mean that all events added to a calendar in your modules will be shown in Outlook. It does not mean that anyone can access or view your Outlook calendar.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">People </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>There is the facility to search:</p>\n<p><strong>My Learning Network</strong></p>\n<p>This screen shows icons / pictures of people in your Learning Network at QMU.

It is not possible to edit any of these settings</li>\n<li><strong>Personalize My Settings</strong> – here you can select whether to have links to My Courses displayed in the Global Navigation menu. You can also customise the number of courses displayed by entering a number in the field: Show only courses visited since ... days Leaving the field blank would result in links to all courses (modules) being displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard - Personalize My Settings]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Change Personal Settings</strong> – these relate to settings for the language pack and page instructions. We recommend that these remain on the default settings (e.g. User Language Pack = System Default; Show all page instructions = Yes)</p>\n<p><strong>Set Privacy Options</strong> – it is recommended that these remain at the default setting.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Edit Notification Settings</span></p>\n<p>Notifications can be received through several channels:</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>For students – via the Student Notifications dashboard (e.g. displays notifications with links to course (module) items or information that have been changed, submitted, created, or that have impending due dates). In some cases tutors will not use this.</p>\n<p>For tutors and students</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Via the Notifications Dashboard (My Hub page);</li>\n<li>Via the Updates and Posts areas of the Global Navigation menu; o Via a mobile application;</li>\n<li>Via email.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Making changes</span></p>\n<p>To make changes to the settings for your notifications, select <strong>Edit Notifications Settings</strong> from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu in <strong>Global Navigation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here you can edit settings for all courses (modules) that you teach/take <strong>(Bulk Edit Notification Settings)</strong>, or if you prefer, you can <strong>Edit Individual Course Settings</strong> (e.g. use this method if some courses need greater monitoring than others).</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard - Editing Setting]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\"><strong>Bulk Edit Notification Settings</strong></span></p>\n<p>In <strong>Courses I am teaching/Course I am taking</strong> you can select to make changes to All courses (modules) or only to the modules selected. In step 1 (Select Course), either select All, or select only the courses (modules) you wish to edit notifications settings for and move these across to the Selected Items area.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard - Changing Setting]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Step 2 shows the channels in which you will receive notifications e.g. mobile and email.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>In step 3 (Settings), make your selections for Dashboard, Mobile and Email beside the notification event type. Toggling the box beside the channel name (e.g. Dashboard) will select/deselect all. For example, if you do not wish to receive notifications for every event type, it may be easier to deselect all and then simply select the few that you do wish to receive.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard - Changing Setting]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Once you have made your choices, go to step 4 and select Submit.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>You will receive a message from the webpage informing you that your selection will overwrite any previous changes you have made and asking if you wish to proceed. Select OK.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard - Changing Setting]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>You should be returned to the Edit Notification Settings screen and a green bar with a message confirming your settings have been saved should be visible.</p>\n<p>If you wish to check your changes have taken effect, go to one of the individual course links beneath <strong>Edit Individual Course Settings</strong>. Here you will see the notifications setting screen greyed out and you will be able to see the settings you have saved. For example, in the following screen shot you can see that Announcement Available, Assignment Available and Content Item Available are selected for notification via the Dashboard, Mobile and email, but other notifications are not selected.</p>\n<p>[image of hub blackboard - Changing Setting]</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Changes you make to notification settings will be saved between Hub sessions. However, if you go back into the Bulk Edit Notifications Settings area it may appear as if nothing has changed – do not be concerned – this merely displays the institutional default settings. <strong>Remember</strong>: you can check your settings by selecting an individual module link from the list.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span class=\"lead\">General Settings</span></p>\n<p>To make changes to the way in which you receive emails, go to Edit General Settings within the Edit Notifications settings area. Here you can choose whether to receive email notifications as individual messages or as a Daily Email Digest. You can also select whether to have notification of Due-Date Reminders sent.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
