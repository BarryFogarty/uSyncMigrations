It is not only a lovely venue to hold our gatherings, it presents an excellent opportunity for GA </strong><strong>members to support the development of QMU students who are studying the BA (Hons) International Hospitality and Tourism. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Students on that course hone their practical </strong><strong>cooking and service skills under the direction of the School’s excellent teaching team, and the cooking and service of some of the GA lunches and dinners is part of </strong><strong>their course assessments. In spring 2022, a team of first year students created a meal themed around the platinum jubilee, whereas our Christmas lunch was traditional </strong><strong>festive fair. Both events in 2022 were very well attended.</strong></p>
<p>GA members look forward to our next spring event, as well as other themed lunches at ENTCS in 2023, which give students the opportunity to develop their skills in a live setting. Our Annual General Meeting, which was also held at ENTCS, included a delicious afternoon tea. Committee members agreed changes to the committee staffing and a proposal on the future direction of the GA. There was also a discussion on the sustainability and ongoing maintenance of Madras Lodge (the GA’s holiday property in Gullane, East Lothian). It was agreed that Madras Lodge required some financial <br />investment, and we can confirm that maintenance work will commence at the Lodge in early 2023.

<p><strong>Fun coffee get-togethers</strong></p>
<p>GA members hold coffee get-togethers on the second Tuesday of each month. A particular highlight was our visit to the Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh, which included a viewing of the ‘Knitwear in Fashion’ exhibition. The event explored knitwear as a fashion <br />item from the early 1900’s up to the present day and included some designer garments from Chanel and Schiaparelli.</p>
<p>The most recent get-together was at National Museum of Scotland. We had coffee, followed by a visit to the Bernat Klein design exhibition – some of us remembered using his fabrics during our studies at QMU!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Event details and invites</strong></p>
<p>Our membership secretary, Claire Seaman, sends out invitations and details of events to members. If you hear of people in the Association not receiving emails from Claire, please do encourage them to contact her at <a href="mailto:claire_seaman@hotmail.co.uk">claire_seaman@hotmail.co.uk</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Membership of the QMU Graduates’ Association</strong></p>
<p>Membership of the GA is open to all students who gain an award from QMU, as well as current and previous staff. With interesting and fun social events throughout the year, we encourage anyone who is not already a member to continue their connection with QMU by joining us as a life member. We would also like to talk to members who might be keen to take on a more active role as a committee member. If you have thoughts or ideas for the GA, please don’t hesitate to contact me <a href="mailto:president@qmuga.org.uk">president@qmuga.org.uk</a></p>]]></Value>
