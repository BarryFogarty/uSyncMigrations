    "content": "<p>My role is Senior Lecturer within the Division of Nursing and Paramedic Science. I have been a Registered Nurse since 1985 and have gained considerable experience within community nursing, particularly district nursing, general practice nursing, quality improvement and practice development. Since moving into higher education in 2003 I have developed and led a range of community nursing programmes and contribute to teaching and learning across undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes. I am currently a member of Senate and the Equality and Diversity committees. In 2021 I was recognised for my contribution to community nursing and was awarded a Fellowship of Queens Nursing Institute, Scotland.</p>\n<p>Within my role I have significant responsibility for research. I am a researcher within the <a href=\"https://www.cpcpr.org/\" title=\"CPCR\">Centre for Person-centred Practice Research</a>  and a Director of the Person-centred Practice - International Community of Practice and co-academic editor of the <a href=\"https://www.fons.org/library/journal-ipdj-home\" title=\"International Practice Development Journal\">International Practice Development Journal</a> . I regularly review papers for a number of other journals including the British Journal of Community Nursing; Journal of Nursing Management and; the International Journal of Older People. I am a member of Sigma global and am active within the Omega Xi chapter. I am also a member of the Community Nursing Research Community of Practice in the UK.</p>\n<p><br />I engage with practice through facilitation of practice development and leadership development within a number of organisations. Using my facilitation expertise and adopting active learning approaches, I help teams to think about person-centred practice and consider ways of developing quality, person-centred practices. This work is informing my teaching and research activity.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Affiliations/Memberships to Other Organisations:</strong><br />• Fellow of Queens Nursing Institute, Scotland<br />• Director Person-centred practice - International Community of Practice<br />• Omega Xi: Sigma chapter<br />• Community Nursing Research Community of Practice<br /><br /><strong>Professional Social Media:</strong><br />• Twitter @cawdickson<br />• Twitter @DNQMU<br />• LinkedIn: Dr Caroline (AW) Dickson</p>\n<p><strong>Research/Knowledge Exchange Centre Membership: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a data-id=\"1269\" href=\"/{localLink:1269}\" title=\"Centre for Person-centred Practice Research\">Centre for Person-centered Practice Research</a> (Affiliate)</li>\n</ul>"

Recent projects include The development of a Person-centred Curriculum Framework; Healthful Leadership in Nursing; The translation of learning about person-centredness into practice from a community nursing preparation programme and; <a href=\"https://www.listenupstorytelling.co.uk/welcome-to-cake/\" title=\"CAKE: A recipe for individual and team well-being and effectiveness\">CAKE:A recipe for individual and team well-being and effectiveness</a>. </p>\n<p>My doctoral research explored the meaning of specialisation from the perspective of District Nurses. This built on previous research into Leadership within Community Nursing.</p>\n<p><br />My methodological expertise lies in participatory research underpinned by practice development, active learning and person-centred practice. I also have experience in realist evaluation and Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. I have supervised learners at honours, masters and doctoral levels. I have published widely in peer-reviewed journals and have presented and national and international conferences</p>"
