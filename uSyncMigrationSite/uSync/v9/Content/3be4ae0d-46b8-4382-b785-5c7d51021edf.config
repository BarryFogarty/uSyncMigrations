<p><span class="lead">Venice, Italy</span></p>
<p>The short academic visit to Venice did not feel short at all, as we did so many different activities that it felt like we were there for much longer. We did not waste our time as we wanted to take in as much as we could of this iconic Italian city.</p>
<p>The lectures were really interesting, eye-opening and provided us with a more global view of some of the problems that different societies are faced with. As a result, we were able to compare how those countries – in this case, Scotland and Italy – might differ for example in their approach to various social regulations.</p>
<p>This trip exceeded my expectations well beyond as I never thought I was going to be able to see so much of Venice. We were able to plan ahead our entire day off and dedicate it entirely to seeing the wonders of this beautiful city. My group was up early in the morning to see the famous St. Mark’s Square where the spectacular St. Mark’s Basilica and its Bell Tower are situated. Apart from that, we also saw many art galleries and exhibitions which led us to look at the city in a new light. It was a truly mesmerizing experience! It is a charming little city thanks to its canals and tiny, colourful alleys which all look very similar but each one of them has a special corner that makes it unique.</p>
<p>Opportunities like this one – to travel to another country with the possibility of participating in educational events in academic fields of interest – do not come often or easily but thanks to Santander Universities selected students can really expand their knowledge while at the same time be part of an amazing adventure.</p>
<p>This was an amazing opportunity to connect and network with others, to share knowledge and culture which is essential for communication and understanding between different people in the world, as different societies hold different values. However, I got to learn that they aren’t that different after all. We all strive for the same goals – to live in a healthy, fair, and well-balanced society where everybody has the same rights.</p>
<p>It was an unforgettable experience shared with an amazing group of people with whom I got to learn a lot but also to share wonderful moments. I would strongly recommend opportunities like this one to other students as it is an unforgettable experience both for our identities and for our minds. To be able to widen your knowledge in such a way, especially about topics that interest you, is an opportunity that cannot be taken for granted.</p>]]></Value>
