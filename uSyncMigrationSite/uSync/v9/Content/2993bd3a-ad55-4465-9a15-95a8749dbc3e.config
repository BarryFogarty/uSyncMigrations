    "content": "<p>If you want to take a broad approach to your learning, you can enrol on our MSc Global Health. This approach offers you a thorough grounding in this multidisciplinary field and you can later decide to specialise your studies if you wish. If you wish to develop a set of<br />relevant practical skills that can be applied to global health programming and Interventions, you can enrol on our new MSc Applied Global Health. This degree will give you the skills and competencies you need to promote health of populations through contextually appropriate health policies, services and interventions.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can choose a more focused pathway at the outset, with either our MSc Sexual and Reproductive Health or MSc Mental Health and Psychosocial Support. You can also choose to study for one of our PgCert qualifications such as in Health Interventions in Fragile and Conflict Affected Settings or Mental Health and Psychosocial Support. These can be a good option if you have time, work or<br />other commitments that would conflict with studying for a full Master’s. We have deliberately designed our courses to be as flexible as possible, so you can apply for the course that best suits your career needs and later revise your choice before progressing to the dissertation stage (this is subject to you having studied the appropriate modules).</p>\n<p><strong>MSc Global Health</strong></p>\n<p>Global health is increasingly being focused on as a major driver of development, international co-operation and diplomacy, not only during outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This makes it not only a very interesting field of study, but also an incredibly important one regardless of the setting you will work in.</p>\n<p>How can societies implement more effective intervention strategies? Who is responsible for initiating and then delivering the strategy in a low income setting? The answers to most of the important questions in this field are complex and your studies will prepare you to answer them through a multidisciplinary approach. This is about gaining a truly global perspective on the state of people’s health, and enhancing<br />your knowledge through a systematic examination of health problems and their determinants.</p>\n<p>This course will be relevant to you if you are working, or planning to work, in enhancing population health in low income settings or middle or low income countries, be this within governmental (e.g. ministries of health), nongovernmental or intergovernmental organisations (e.g. WHO or UN agencies).</p>\n<p>It will equip you to work effectively at a senior level to promote the health and social wellbeing of populations, through the development of effective and responsive health systems. It will orient you onto issues on which Institute staff are recognised to have made world-leading research contributions, such as health systems strengthening in fragile and conflict-affected states, or mental health and psychosocial support for vulnerable populations.</p>\n<p>Participants are typically drawn from a broad range of backgrounds, including physicians, nurses, allied health professions, development and humanitarian workers, as well as health ministry and NGO employees.</p>"
