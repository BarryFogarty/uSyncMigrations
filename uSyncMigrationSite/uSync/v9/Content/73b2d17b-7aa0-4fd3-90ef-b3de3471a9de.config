<p><span class="lead">3.0 Site Statistics</span></p>
<p>We do gather non-personal data regarding site visitors to our website. This is provided to use statistical information on visits to pages, type of browsers being used to view the site, paths taken through the site and other general information. Under no circumstances can this be linked to a particular person.</p>
<p><span class="lead">4.0 Cookies</span></p>
<p>A "cookie" is a small text file, which helps the server to identify your computer but not the individual. The cookies help us to make your visitor session a more personal and enriching experience and are described in more detail below.<br /><br />By using our website, you agree that we can place these cookies on your computer. Please refer to your browser's Help function, or visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" class="txtMainTextLinks">www.aboutcookies.org</a> for further details on how to control and delete cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Types of cookies</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Strictly necessary/standard cookies</li>
</ol>
<p>These will generally be used to store a unique identifier to manage and identify you as unique to other users currently viewing the website, in order to provide a consistent and accurate service to you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Functionality cookies</li>
</ol>
<p>Will typically be the result of an action you have taken, but might also be implemented in the delivery of a service not explicitly requested but offered to you. They can also be used to prevent you being offered a service again that had previously been offered to you and rejected. (See ‘Cookies set by Queen Margaret University’ below).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Performance cookies</li>
</ol>
<p>These are limited to performance and website improvement. (See ‘Cookies set by Queen Margaret University’ below).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Targeting/advertising cookies</li>
</ol>
<p>These contain a unique key that is able to distinguish individual users’ browsing habits or store a code that can be translated into a set of browsing habits or preferences using information stored elsewhere. (See ‘Third Party Cookies’ below).<br /><br /><strong>Cookies set by Queen Margaret University</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies on www.qmu.ac.uk to collect anonymous visitor statistics via Google Analytics to help us improve our site.</p>
<p>What are these cookies called, and what do they do?</p>

<p>These three cookies are placed by Universal (Google) Analytics and help us understand how visitors interact with our website.</p>
<p>Universal (Google) Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not share our collected data with Google. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html" class="txtMainTextLinks">Read more about Google Analytics</a> or download the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" class="txtMainTextLinks">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Third party cookies (Advertising and Remarketing)</strong></p>
<p>Some of our website pages use third party services or software, such as maps, online videos (YouTube) or social networking features. Many of these services may set cookies on your device.</p>
<p>However, you can block or remove cookies yourself by altering the settings of your browser. Blocking these cookies is unlikely to impact on your experience of our website.</p>
<p>In addition, Queen Margaret University uses third party technologies to advertise online as explained below. Advertising companies use cookies to make ads more relevant to you, keeping a track of the ads you have seen or the ads that your browser has been exposed to. This prevents you being exposed to the same advert, too many times.</p>
<p>These third parties include media partners such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn and make use of ‘remarketing’ cookies – both first party (such as Google Adwords and Google Analytics) and third party (such as a range of DoubleClick branded services). They serve more relevant ads to users based on such users’ past visits to our website, whether those users are on our website or on other websites.</p>
<p>Some of our other cookies may be used to measure ‘conversion events’ as well. For example, DoubleClick and Google Analytics cookies may also be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Remarketing cookies typically expire a maximum of 180 days from the time that the cookie is set or updated (whichever is the later).</p>
