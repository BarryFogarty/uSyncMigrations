      <Value><![CDATA[<p><span class="lead-big">Statement issued on 18 January 2024</span></p>
<p>Dear staff and students</p>
<p><strong> </strong>I wanted to update colleagues on our position on the conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territory of Gaza, having last written to you on this subject in late October.</p>
<p>I should start by acknowledging that the suffering continues, particularly for the people living in Gaza; indeed, that it has significantly intensified, and that there has also been increased violence in the West Bank.  That in no way diminishes the horror of the attacks on Israel on 7 October or the suffering of the families of the hostages. We abhor all violence against civilians and recognise the terrible impact and human suffering for all those involved and living in the region. We also recognise that this conflict is causing deep hurt to many colleagues and students at QMU, particularly those with relatives and friends living in Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank.</p>
<p>Our position as a university remains that we will not take sides except that of humanity, and to express our fervent wish for an end to hostilities and a lasting and just peace.  In supporting dialogue towards achieving that peace, we are clear that universities must continue to be places where difficult issues such as this conflict can be discussed and debated within the law. I know that the Students’ Union shares our position.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank a delegation of staff and students who came to speak to myself and senior colleagues just before Christmas to convey, with respect and insight, their deep concerns over the situation, and particularly the plight of people living in Gaza.  I would offer the same opportunity to any colleagues or students, whatever their perspective.</p>
<p>Our primary concern remains for those studying and working at QMU and I would remind everyone of the advice and support available, as set out at the foot of this message.</p>
<p>I ask again that colleagues and students continue to treat each other with respect and kindness when discussing or engaging with issues relating to the conflict.</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p><span class="lead-big">Statement Issued 26 October 2023</span></p>
<p>Dear staff and students</p>
<p>With the horrific conflict in the Middle East showing no sign of abating, I am writing to update you on support resources for students and staff affected.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with all those affected by the conflict, both directly and indirectly. As a community of staff and students drawn from regions across the world, we will have family, friends and colleagues in the region and beyond who may really need our support and compassion right now.</p>
<p>I would encourage anyone affected in any way to call on the University’s support services, details of which are set out at the foot of this message.</p>
<p>At this time, it is more important than ever that we continue to express our views with respect and understanding, in line with our values as an inclusive, supportive community. There is no place at QMU for antisemitism, islamophobia, racism, religious or other intolerance or harassment. While we are unaware of any such incidents, if you experience or witness any such behaviour, you can report it directly through Report and Support, or seek support from the services listed below.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you feel you need to discuss anything with me on this subject.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Paul</p>
