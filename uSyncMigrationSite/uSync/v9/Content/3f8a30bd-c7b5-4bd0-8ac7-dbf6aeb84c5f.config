      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The original acts, directed and performed by QMU graduates, some who are members of The Bawsoot Theatre Company, will be staged at the ‘Space’ on the Royal Mile, running from 10th to 22nd of August. Preview performances will take place on the 7th and 8th of August.</p>
<p>The Bawsoot Theatre Company, a creative group of young theatre practitioners founded in 2012 by QMU drama and performance graduates Jack Gemmell, Emilie Robson, Laila Noble and Laura Caldwell, is to return this year with their original adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe’s, The Raven.</p>
<p>The story is centred on a plagued protagonist, their reimagining depicts a graphic tale of obsession and the pursuit of perfection, infused with their own Insta- generational ideals. It is a unique retelling of Poe’s classic told through a fusion of poetry and physical theatre.</p>
<p>This adaptation is highly anticipated after a successful stint at last year’s Edinburgh Fringe with ‘Swiss Cheese’, which used the setting of an uncomfortable dinner party reunion to discuss the implications of euthanasia.</p>
<p>Laila Noble, graduate and director of The Raven, said “It’s satisfying to represent QMU and we are very excited to be performing at the Edinburgh festival this year, especially after graduation. Last year’s play was a huge success and we are really looking forward to be in the spotlight after much hardwork and positive feedback”.</p>
<p>Emerging theatre company, Eclectic Impact, founded by Michelle Haynes, Sarah Masson and Katie Mitchell, who met whilst studying BA (Hons) Drama and Performance at Queen Margaret University are taking a show to Edinburgh Festival Fringe called ‘Lost for words’. This performance will take place at the Zoo Venue in the Monkey House.</p>
<p>This act explores the qualities of a good politician' through movement, human experience and political advancements. The performance will give an insight into the highly energetic and politically engaged nation that Scotland has recently become and seeks to find the secret recipe for the perfect politician.</p>
<p>Heidi Vistisen, president of the QMU Student Union commented: “It’s brilliant to see so much talent from our University at one of the most popular festivals in the world. Edinburgh Fringe is known to showcase current and upcoming talents in the arts, so to have so many high quality performances from QMU is not just a huge achievement for our University and Union, but for the city as well. I’m so pleased for our students and cannot wait to watch them perform.”</p>]]></Value>
