      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Practice–based learning is a vital and indispensable part of occupational therapy students’ learning process in their educational and professional development. Practice experience enables the acquisition of new knowledge and skills as well as the application, consolidation and reflection upon learning gained in the university environment.</p>
<p>The success of practice-based learning is highly dependent upon a clear and supportive interchange between occupational therapy students, practice educators, practice education host organisations, and Queen Margaret University. All documentation relating to practice placements is available via <a href="/current-students/practice-based-learning/nursing-and-allied-health-programmes-pbl-information/" title="Queen Margaret University’s  Practice-Based Learning Support website">Queen Margaret University’s <span> Practice-Based Learning Support webpage</span></a></p>
<p>On behalf of Queen Margaret University, we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your involvement in this shared process. We hope that that practice-based learning will prove to be a fulfilling and rewarding experience for everyone involved.</p>

    "content": "<p><strong>Allocation of practice placements</strong></p>\n<p>In January each year, the Placement Administrator forwards placement request forms to the Practice Placement Co-ordinators’ Network requesting placements offers for practice-based learning modules for the next academic year.  These forms are forwarded electronically to the network and returned to the University in the same way by the end of March.  Offers received are collated by placement block and entered onto the occupational therapy placement offers database by the Placement Administrator.   If there is a shortfall of offers, the University will telephone network members directly requesting additional placements.</p>\n<p>Students are not permitted to organise their own practice placements. There is a placement allocation process.   Students complete a practice placement planning form and upload this to an electronic drop box in the Hub.   Although individual student needs are taken into consideration, this does not mean that all needs/ requests can be accommodated.   Placement availability is dynamic and complex, moreover services are changing dramatically, and as such it is impossible to predict the exact provision of placements that will be available throughout the programme. Students can only be allocated to placements that exist.</p>\n<p>The allocation of placement offers is normally completed <u>12 weeks</u> before the start date of each placement, and displayed in the Hub. Allocations for the first post graduate practice placement are normally completed <u>eight weeks</u>prior to the placement start date.  The Practice Placement Coordinators’ network is notified by e-mail/post when allocations have been completed for each practice placement module.</p>\n<p>All placements are allocated to students by the Professional Practice Tutor with due regard to the Subject Area Practice Placement Allocation Process.</p>\n<p><strong>Guiding principles</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fairness and appropriateness to each student/cohort in the allocation process</li>\n<li>Ensuring that every student has a well rounded, and balanced practice placement profile at the point of  applying for registration to the regulatory body, the Health and Care Professions Council</li>\n<li>Individual learning needs including health-related, and disability issues</li>\n<li>Student’s profile/additional information</li>\n<li>Previous placement experience/location</li>\n<li>Extenuating special circumstances</li>\n<li>Capacity of practice area</li>\n<li>Student’s term time, or home address</li>\n<li>Placement availability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students would not be placed in a service where a conflict of interest in relation to assessment of their performance is identified. The responsibility is with the student to bring their circumstances to the attention of the Professional Practice Tutor prior to the allocation of placements.</p>\n<p>Once a specific placement is allocated then this becomes part of the curriculum offered to the student. Any unreasonable refusal of a placement may be deemed as refusing the curriculum offered. Students do not have the right to contest their placement allocations on the grounds of, for example, time, travel, or financial resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Allocation of practice placements to students with religious and/or cultural observances </strong></p>\n<p>A student’s identity, such as their religious/ cultural practices can have a significant impact on teaching, learning and assessment in practice.   However, it is a statutory requirement that the University and placement providers address these through establishing relevant policies and guidance which address diversity and inclusion</p>\n<p>(Scottish Parliament 2012; Great Britain Parliament 2010).</p>\n<p>These policies include a commitment to:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>promoting equal opportunity and diversity during employment;</li>\n<li>ensuring all employees are treated fairly and valued equally;</li>\n<li>valuing religious and cultural needs and practices, and meeting these where possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong>Students may have particular religious or cultural needs in terms of requests which may appear to “conflict” with existing working requirements in the practice setting. Such issues may include:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>health and safety issues relating to dress code;</li>\n<li>request for flexible working related to religious/belief-related festivals;</li>\n<li>adjustments for prayer time, and space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whilst it may not always be possible to accommodate every student’s religious or cultural observance, every effort will be made to find a mutually agreeable solution. </p>\n<p><strong>Guiding principles</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Normally, students will be allocated placements according to their learning needs, unless there is some exceptional reason, which would impact adversely on the student or placement.</li>\n<li>In these exceptional circumstances, negotiation between the student, the University, and placement provider is essential. </li>\n<li>Established policies that apply to employed staff also apply to students accepted on placement.  It is vital that discussion takes place on the religious and cultural needs of the student and how they will be valued and/or met whilst on placement.</li>\n<li>Agreements between the student and placement provider may occur prior to, or at the outset of any placement as part of the induction process.  These should be reviewed and discussed with the student at the midway point of the placement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Allocation of practice placements to disabled students</strong></p>\n<p>Queen Margaret University is committed to equality of opportunity and believes in a culture of diversity and inclusion (QMU 2014b).   Disabled students should experience the same broad range of practice settings as non–disabled students to enable them to demonstrate that they have achieved the learning outcomes for each placement.   In this respect a physical or mental impairment includes sensory impairments, mental illness or mental health issues, specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia and conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy.</p>\n<p>Disabled students are actively encouraged to meet with the Professional Practice Tutor to discuss their Individual Learning Plan agreed with the University Disability Adviser including any necessary support or adjustments which may be necessary to enable them to meet the learning outcomes of each practice placement.<strong>   </strong>Normally, requests for a meeting are initiated through submission of an annual self-declaration of Fitness to Practise Form to the Practice Education Area in the Hub.</p>\n<p>Practice education involves a range of relationships, rights and responsibilities, some legal, and others negotiable between the student, University, and placement provider. <span>  </span>The University acknowledges that not all information about a student’s disability or health may be relevant to placement providers and that normally, information would be provided on a need to know basis.</p>\n<p>Reasonable adjustments during practice placements are dependent on students disclosing a disability or health condition, or at least, sharing information about their needs with the placement provider via the OT Student Advance Information for Practice Educators Form.   Moreover provision of this information enables the University to liaise with placement providers, and arrange any necessary support or adjustments that students need to enable fulfillment of the learning outcomes of the placement.</p>\n<p>Students should keep their Personal Academic Tutor, or Programme Leader, and Practice Educator informed of any changes to their health status.   The University will seek to put in place measures to support disabled students so far as is reasonably practical. It is essential that students discuss any concerns they may have with staff as early as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice placement locations</strong></p>\n<p>Practice placements are located throughout mainland Scotland, including some of the island areas.   Students complete placements in services where Practice Placement Agreements have been established and formalised between the University and placement providers.  </p>\n<p>Due to the wide geographical dispersal of placements, it is expected that <u>every </u>student will complete placements involving significant daily travel to, and from placement sites (normally, 1½ hours travel time each way), and/or moving into temporary accommodation.</p>\n<p>It is acknowledged that some students may have particular needs which in <u>some </u>instances can only be supported by the student undertaking their practice placement(s) in a specific location.   This may apply to:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students with young/school age children, or with other family responsibilities e.g. sole carer of a disabled relative;</li>\n<li>A disabled student as defined by the Equality Act (2010) who requires a placement within daily travelling distance. This will be specified in their Individual Learning Plan agreed with the Queen Margaret University Disability Adviser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In such circumstances, normally, the placement allocation is based on the principles of approximately no more than 80 miles daily travelling from permanent home, or term time address dependent on individual circumstances, and placement availability.</p>\n<p>There may be opportunities for students to undertake placements in Europe with partners whom the Division has developed Erasmus + Exchange Agreements.   This opportunity is subject to a robust selection process involving the Professional Practice Tutor, Programme Leader and where appropriate, Erasmus + Exchange Co-ordinator. </p>\n<p><strong>Practice placement experiences</strong></p>\n<p>Each practice placement experience encompasses working with people who are experiencing different occupational issues. Experiences typically include working with:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People of different ages across the life course;</li>\n<li>Individuals, or groups, and communities from different socio-economic, and cultural perspectives;</li>\n<li>People who have recently acquired, and/or long standing occupational needs;</li>\n<li>People living with health conditions affecting different aspects of physical, and psychosocial functioning;</li>\n<li>Marginalised individuals, or groups and communities (e.g. people seeking asylum, homeless individuals).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students develop skills in effective service delivery within inter professional, multi- agency contexts.   This may include both established and emerging services within the public, independent, and third sectors. </p>\n<p>Each student undertakes placements in a diverse range of settings providing them with appropriate educational experiences in preparation for the realities of contemporary and future practice. Specific settings can include but are not limited to community-based services; (e.g. intermediate care teams, primary care teams, community rehabilitation teams, reablement services); resource centres; care homes; schools and further education colleges; workplace; third sector and hospital environments (e.g. inpatient services, outpatient services, inreach/outreach services).</p>\n<p>Students forward their OT Student Advance Information for Practice Educators Form and introductory e-mail to the relevant practice placement coordinator or specific placement site at least six weeks prior to the start date of the placement.   As much notice as possible is requested from the host site if a placement offer has to be cancelled in order that an alternative placement may be found for the student.  The cancellation process from the PPA’s should be followed for NHS placements.</p>\n<p><strong>Change to practice placement after allocation</strong></p>\n<p>Placement allocations are non-negotiable.   A change of placement allocation is not a commonly occurring event and is avoided.   Students do not have the right to exchange allocated placement with their peers.   Normally, the programme teams do not enter into third party communications about allocated placements.   The responsibility lies with the student to raise reasonable and relevant concerns directly with the Professional Practice Tutor.</p>\n<p>Personal preference is not considered a valid reason to request a change in placement.   All allocated placements are deemed relevant and will offer appropriate learning experiences.</p>\n<p>Financial hardship is not considered a valid reason to change a placement.   Students should consider the cost of practice placements as being a necessary and integral part of the programme and plan for this in advance.</p>\n<p>Students may only request a change in placement allocation for <u>extenuating circumstances</u> not identified on the initial practice placement planning form, e.g.</p>\n<p>changes to health or well- being requiring reasonable adjustments, significant personal issues such as bereavement related to the type of placement.   Relevant supporting evidence must be provided to the Professional Practice Tutor (e.g. medical certificate) before any such request can be considered.   Evidence that is subsequently proven to be false is brought to the attention of the Programme Leader.</p>\n<p>Requesting a change to a practice placement allocation does not guarantee that it can be made.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice placement travel and accommodation expenses  </strong></p>\n<p>If the placement is away from the student’s home area and/or term time address and too far for daily travel students will need to stay away during the placement.   There is no direct provision by Queen Margaret University for accommodation whilst on placement; students are expected to arrange temporary accommodation for the duration of their placements using the information resources provided in the Practice Education Area in the Hub.</p>\n<p>Students should consider the cost of practice placements as being a necessary and integral element of the programme and plan for this in advance.   Undergraduate students may be eligible to claim back placement expenses either for additional accommodation or travel from the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS).   There is no direct financial remuneration available to post graduate students for the funding of travelling, or accommodation costs associated with placements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undergraduate students who are in receipt of an award from SAAS may be able to claim back for placement travel and accommodation costs from SAAS.<strong>  </strong>Students should retain all receipts and submit these to SAAS. Claims are subject to the travel element already included in the Standard Maintenance Allowance.  Further information is available from the <a href=\"https://www.saas.gov.uk\" title=\"SAAS Website\">SAAS website </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.saas.gov.uk/index.htm\"></a>International undergraduate students and self funding undergraduate  students are not eligible to claim for expenses from SAAS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The University Student Finance Service administers two discretionary funds provided by the Scottish Government. These are the Childcare Fund which is aimed at students who incur childcare costs whilst studying and the Hardship Fund when students find themselves facing exceptional financial problems.</p>\n<p>The International Fund is provided by the University and students from outwith the United Kingdom should apply to this fund.</p>\n<p>An application form is completed and submitted with supporting evidence which is then considered at a confidential monthly meeting of the Hardship Committee.   It is useful to make an appointment to see the Student Finance Adviser before submitting an application.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Student Finance Adviser contact Bill Stronach at <a href=\"mailto:Studentfunding@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Student funding Email\">Student funding</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Practice placement hours</strong></p>\n<p>In order to meet standards established and monitored by professional bodies, it should be noted that by the end of Practice Placement 4 every student is required to have successfully completed a minimum of 1000 hours of practice education (WFOT, 2016; RCOT, 2019a).</p>\n<p>Students are expected to work the same hours as their practice educators and these may vary between services, e.g. 8.30 am-4.30 pm, or 8.00 am-4.00 pm, or 9.00 am-5.00 pm.</p>\n<p>Some services operate over seven working days and therefore placement may involve evening, and weekend attendance.  Students should not assume they will be on placement Mondays–Fridays, daytime attendance only.  </p>\n<p>Absence of a written record of the appropriate number of hours may result in a student having to complete extra placement hours prior to graduation.   If difficulties arise with placement hours, practice educators, and students are actively encouraged draw this to the attention of the University so that a mutually acceptable plan of action can be developed.</p>\n<p>Every student has an individual practice placement profile logged by the Practice Placement Administrator to denote accumulated practice placement hours, and placement experiences across the course of their education.   Each student’s practice placement hours is verified by the Professional Practice Tutor at the culmination of the programme to confirm eligibility for award.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice placement study time</strong></p>\n<p>A requirement of the programmes is that each student is allocated a half day of  personal study per week (4 hours) for the <u>full-time practice placements</u> at a time agreed with the practice educator.   Study time is included in the overall placement hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Working relationship between student and practice educators</strong></p>\n<p>Students work closely with their practice educators during practice placements.  It is important to remember that practice educators’ first responsibilities are to service users and that in addition to facilitating students’ learning they have many additional responsibilities to deal with on a day-to-day basis.   Giving consideration and thought to practice educators’ responsibilities should enable the establishment of an effective working relationship.   Students are advised to put the safety and well-being of service-users before personal concerns, for example practice placement grades, other work related to their programme of study, employment prospects, or other personal gain (HCPC 2016).</p>\n<p>Practice educators collaborate with students to identify how the University learning outcomes for each practice placement will be achieved and help the student to determine a clear pathway for achieving these through the development of a Learning Agreement.</p>\n<p>In addition to ongoing informal supervision from the practice educator, normally, students receive a weekly formal supervision session for full time placements, and a fortnightly formal supervision session for part-time placements.   If these sessions are not forthcoming from the practice educator, then the student should request these from the practice educator.</p>\n<p>Practice educators assess students performance on placement using the University grade descriptors for undergraduate programmes (QMU 2021).   Students must have realistic expectations about their performance during practice placement, and acknowledge that practice educators are responsible for the assessed outcome. The A* grade indicates an excellent performance and therefore is not the norm. It is unrealistic for all students to expect that they will always achieve top grades.  As a result the C grade is identified as a good performance and therefore the A* grade is for an outstanding performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Models of supervision during practice placements</strong></p>\n<p>A variety of supervision models – both well established, and innovative/developing approaches - are deployed throughout practice placements. These variations enable a flexible, sustainable and responsive approach to the organisation of practice education, enabling the Subject Area to meet student requirements, whilst also in some cases addressing community needs.  These include:</p>\n<p><strong>Apprenticeship model (1:1)</strong></p>\n<p>One student per practice educator (occupational therapist). The practice educator structures the student learning experiences and provides direct supervision and role-modelling to the student throughout the course of their placement. The degree of supervision and the amount of responsibility given to the student may vary, depending on the practice setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer assisted learning model (2:1)</strong></p>\n<p>One practice educator (occupational therapist) supervises two or more students. Here the emphasis is on peer and self-directed learning where the students support each other and work together. The practice educator acts as a resource, providing guidance to the student, monitoring performance and providing opportunity for the students to take increasing responsibility with service users. Benefits of this model include development of team-work skills, increased problem-solving skills and a sense of shared-ownership of the learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Model (1:2, 1:3, 1:4)</strong></p>\n<p>In this model, the education of a student may be shared between two or more members of a team (occupational therapists) within a workplace. Combinations might include an experienced practice educator and a new practice educator;  two practice educators from different organisations and the placement being structured around the service user journey  for example, from primary to secondary care This model may  be an attractive option for practitioners who work part-time, or if the practitioner’s caseload is coupled with management responsibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Project focussed model</strong></p>\n<p>In project-focussed models (Fortune &amp; McKinstry 2015; Fortune et al.. 2006), students work on projects or undertake a key role in developmental aspect of project work  related to prevention, health promotion, supported self management, or service development activities that could be applied at a group, or community level.  The project – focussed model can use alternate supervision models including face-face  supervision, or long armed  professional supervision from an occupational therapist. Students may work in pairs during these placements afford opportunities to realise the benefits of peer assisted learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Colloborative model</strong></p>\n<p>This model is currently being developed by the Subject Area and is influenced by global drivers to prepare students for occupation-focussed, community-centred practice (Hyett et al. 2015). It acknowledges that all people have the right to participate in occupation (Kronenberg et al. 2011) and recognises the need for occupational therapists to use enablement approaches with communities (Kirsh 2015; Polatajko et al. 2015; Townsend et al. 2013).   In the collaborative model the community is viewed as the client and an entity for collaboration, not simply the setting.  Emphasis is placed upon using enablement skills including advocacy, teaching, collaboration, consultation and education to co-implement and achieve the goals, and occupational outcomes that are identified by the communities themselves. Many, user-led organisations may provide rich and unique learning experiences with potential for exploration of these concepts.</p>\n<p>Throughout the placement an on-site mentor at the host service supports the student.  Long armed professional supervision is provided by an occupational therapist, which may be on a face-face basis, by long distance via telephone, and/or digital technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning agreement</strong></p>\n<p>For each practice placement students prepare a Learning Agreement in collaboration with their practice educator(s). The Learning Agreement acts as the keystone where student and practice educator(s) both agree what is to be learned, how the student is going to demonstrate their learning, how the student’s learning is to be assessed and the timescale. It encourages shared commitment in the learning process as well as  providing a focus for weekly formal supervision time. The Learning Agreement is reviewed during supervision, when learning outcomes are evaluated and specific learning goals, in relation to the core skills of occupational therapy, are identified for the coming week.  Thus there is shared responsibility for the learning experience as students work in partnership with their practice educator(s) to try to secure a successful outcome.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Important!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Learning Agreements are the keystone for student-centred learning throughout each practice placement. The Subject Area respectfully requests that placement providers/ practice educators refrain from giving pre-determined weekly placement objectives to students</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reflective diary</strong></p>\n<p>Students use reflective diaries as part of the process of learning and reflection and in preparation for supervision sessions with their practice educator(s). The diary in part, focuses on specific aspects of practice and students use it to plan and prepare for work.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice placement portfolio</strong></p>\n<p>As part of their professional development students compile a practice placement portfolio during placements using a proforma developed by the programme team.  The use of portfolios gives students opportunities to evidence and reflect upon their learning.  This process prepares students for using portfolios to evidence their continuing professional development after completion of their studies (HCPC 2012c; RCOT 2021)</p>\n<p><strong>Complaints handing procedure</strong></p>\n<p>The University has implemented a Complaints Handling Procedure (QMU 2013a) which can be found here [ broken link ] The Procedure has three stages: frontline resolution, investigation and external review.</p>\n<p>If a student has a complaint they should discuss this with someone in the area which the student wishes to complain about (for example, for a complaint relating to a practice placement, this should be discussed with the Programme Leader or Professional Practice Tutor for the practice placement module concerned).</p>\n<p>The complaint will be considered under frontline resolution (unless complex) and a response will usually be given within 5 working days. If the complaint is complicated, it is the student’s choice to take it to investigation stage immediately or it may be referred to the investigation stage by the person the student determined to discuss the complaint with at frontline resolution. Should the complaint be considered under the investigation stage, a response will normally be received within 20 working days.</p>\n<p>Any queries about the complaints procedure or any complaints written on the Complaints Form may be e-mailed to <a href=\"mailto:complaints@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Complaints Email Address\">Complaints Email Address </a></p>\n<p> </p>"

These processes are initiated during induction week.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to conform to policy agreed within individual service settings. Practice educators will make these requirements known to students in advance of starting the placement.  Some practice placement sites may require a uniform whereas in other settings smart, casual dress is the norm.</p>\n<p>Students are referred to the NHS Scotland Dress Code (2010) and advised to dress professionally and for ease of movement wear comfortable clothing. This can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/dl/DL(2018)04.pdf\" title=\"NHS Scotland Dress Code\">NHS Scotland Dress Code</a></p>\n<p>In settings where name badges are worn, these must be visible at all times; some settings may also require an additional security pass.</p>\n<p>Uniforms if worn during placement must be clean and changed on a daily basis.  Cardigans and sweatshirts worn for warmth should suit the colour of the uniform and these should be removed when working with service users. Footwear must be clean and in good repair, low heeled, closed toed rubber soled, non- pervious shoes are recommended. Black or navy shoes are preferable, however in some settings clean trainers of a non- pervious material are permissible.  Socks should be plain in keeping with the colour of the uniform.</p>\n<p>presentation on the service user.  Dressing in a neutral/modest way is less likely to provoke a reaction. Logos and words on clothing may be fashionable but inappropriate as they may have adverse connotations.  Similarly clothes should not be too revealing (whatever the gender of the student) i.e. too tight, too short revealing parts of the body area. Underwear should not be visible either through clothing or because outer clothing does not cover underwear adequately.</p>\n<p>When a scarf or a veil is worn, students should ensure that the flow of the garment promotes effective communication and safe moving and handling.  Scarves or veils should be changed on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Most placement sites will have a strict policy regarding the wearing of jewellery. This again is for students’ safety as well as that of service users. Policies allow for religious/cultural observance - a ring (plain band) a bangle (plain) or a necklace worn next to the skin is allowed.  Normally, one metal smooth studded earring per lobe is permitted. Body piercings and tattoos may cause concerns in some placement settings and consequently may need to be removed or covered up.</p>\n<p>Watches are permissible however these may need to be removed throughout the course of the day.</p>\n<p>Hair falling over the face during practical work is not acceptable and would require appropriate action. Hair should be tied back off the collar and nails kept clean and short. Nail polish, artificial finger nails or nail extensions should not be worn within the placement setting.</p>\n<p>In many instances students will be working in close proximity to service users therefore personal hygiene is an important consideration.</p>\n<p>A student whose personal appearance is deemed to be inappropriate by the practice educator or most senior member of staff present in the practice area may be asked to leave the practice setting and reported absent until they return dressed appropriately.  Placement hours may be deducted for this absence.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to be mindful of personal safety, infection control, and being a representative of the University and professional programme they are undertaking in addition to any placement provider policies and guidelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Promoting a safe working environment</strong></p>\n<p>Every student must complete mandatory education and training upon a range of health and safety issues before the first practice placement begins, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adult Protection</li>\n<li>Basic life support</li>\n<li>Child Protection</li>\n<li>De-escalation principles</li>\n<li>Information governance, and informed consent</li>\n<li>Manual handling</li>\n<li>Selected elements of the Scottish Infection Control and Prevention Educational Pathway (SIPCEP) Web link:[Broken link ] </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Preparation for placement workshops</strong></p>\n<p>Interactive workshops held at the University enable students to prepare for each practice placement.  Workshops are facilitated by the Professional Practice Tutor and focus upon topics salient to each practice placement such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review of the University learning outcomes  for each placement, and exploration of how these will facilitate the integration of theory and practice;</li>\n<li>Professional conduct during practice placements;</li>\n<li>Learning styles and the learning cycle;</li>\n<li>Professional, and clinical reasoning;</li>\n<li>Reviewing Assessment Form for each placement;</li>\n<li>Preparation for, and review of self-evaluation on placements;</li>\n<li>Developing and using Learning Agreements during practice placements;</li>\n<li>Developing, and using a professional development portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To complement the face-face pre-placement workshops, students complete an interactive on-line programme of study – Preceptor Education Programme (PEP) for Health Professionals and Students.   Each module (eight in total) takes about 30 minutes to complete including a reflective element.  Students download certificates of completion for each of the modules and store these in their practice education passport.

In many of these cases, a responsible adult, usually a parent or guardian (or other person authorised to carry out this role) who is legally entitled to speak on their behalf will be asked to give their consent. This needs to be carefully and clearly recorded in the person’s care records.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Confidentiality issues during practice placements</strong></p>\n<p>Ensuring confidentiality is not just good practice; it is a right owed to all individuals and is central to the maintenance of trust between a health care professional and service users. They have the legitimate expectation that students will respect their privacy and act appropriately.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to adhere to and comply with guidance provided by the regulatory body (HCPC 2016; HCPC 2012a) and the professional body (RCOT 2021a) as well as referring to the NHS Scotland Code of Practice on Protecting Patient Confidentiality (NHS Scotland 2012).  This can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.beithhealthcentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Code_of_Confidentiality.pdf\" title=\"NHS Scotland Code of Practice\">NHS Scotland Code of Practice</a></p>\n<p>Service user case notes and records are the property of the placement provider they must be kept physically and electronically secure at all times. Paper based records should never be removed from the placement setting.  Any written work completed by students during placement must also be stored as a confidential record.</p>\n<p>Students are expected that to maintain the boundaries of confidentiality outside placement both in discussions, presentations and written course work for the University.  At all times, the identity of service users, staff, and the organisation hosting the placement must be protected, and permission for the use of case material sought following the policies and guidelines of the placement provider. </p>\n<p><strong>People using occupational therapy services</strong></p>\n<p>In keeping with the above principles it is required that any written work or other such work submitted by students as part of theirs studies must preserve people’s identity. In order to ensure this any work must not refer to:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Person’s name, address, or date of birth;</li>\n<li>Any identifiable image of the service user;</li>\n<li>Community Health Index (CHI) number, or other identifiable code;</li>\n<li>Rare conditions where a small population may allow identification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This can be achieved by anonymised, or pseudonymised information and clearly marking it as such.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement organisations</strong></p>\n<p>It is important that students do not specifically name staff, or work placement areas on any documents, or in assignments submitted to the University. Students are advised to describe placements in general terms for example, “community rehabilitation team”, “vocational rehabilitation service”, “intensive psychiatric care unit”.</p>\n<p>Practice educators are an important part of the assessment process and should demonstrate good practice when assessing student’s written work prepared for placement. It is important to recognise that students are in a learning situation, formative feedback is an essential part of supporting students to comply with good practice.  Practice educators will report actual, and possible student breaches of security or confidentiality to the University as a matter of priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice Educator Preparation</strong></p>\n<p>TURAS Practice Educator Training - eLearning units </p>\n<p>This is now available on <a href=\"https://nhsefs.b2clogin.com/nhsefs.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1a_turas_signin_prd/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=0c6117db-8794-474c-8596-c91798d4538a&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.nes.nhs.scot&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;scope=openid&amp;state=OpenIdConnect.AuthenticationProperties%3DCaQCeShnCexMP4qka0dR41QVHydcK9kI89k4i4DfVRJpKCOkzsvGaTy4kyZeDtEvOxTmPSpJtGi_PD0AX3snVcNsEi0GuVizOJ-fANjVJD2Z0i1WwMPlFkNzuZmy8I7Vc2Se_dK2sZTRhO7IR2rzScRa9IUNB2CvHJB9fK30QmRMTEqNP9MJEaiNQVZt2L-KSoSF7rabxRet71yggjhbHyro6EZATvAHDTRdE86RgWE7uPzeuC8-sr-9gEQ62eBGr8UJIHoF_hGNZNVyJteuRA&amp;response_mode=form_post&amp;nonce=637977089661261836.YzFjNTg1OGYtYmUyNC00YWNlLWJlNGYtZDA1ZTQ3ODBhMGY2NDE4YjAwYzAtNjk0NC00MDBjLTlmYjktYzY5M2ZmODNjMGEz&amp;x-client-SKU=ID_NET461&amp;x-client-ver=5.3.0.0\" title=\"TURAS Practice Educator Website\" data-anchor=\"?client_id=0c6117db-8794-474c-8596-c91798d4538a&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.nes.nhs.scot&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;scope=openid&amp;state=OpenIdConnect.AuthenticationProperties%3DCaQCeShnCexMP4qka0dR41QVHydcK9kI89k4i4DfVRJpKCOkzsvGaTy4kyZeDtEvOxTmPSpJtGi_PD0AX3snVcNsEi0GuVizOJ-fANjVJD2Z0i1WwMPlFkNzuZmy8I7Vc2Se_dK2sZTRhO7IR2rzScRa9IUNB2CvHJB9fK30QmRMTEqNP9MJEaiNQVZt2L-KSoSF7rabxRet71yggjhbHyro6EZATvAHDTRdE86RgWE7uPzeuC8-sr-9gEQ62eBGr8UJIHoF_hGNZNVyJteuRA&amp;response_mode=form_post&amp;nonce=637977089661261836.YzFjNTg1OGYtYmUyNC00YWNlLWJlNGYtZDA1ZTQ3ODBhMGY2NDE4YjAwYzAtNjk0NC00MDBjLTlmYjktYzY5M2ZmODNjMGEz&amp;x-client-SKU=ID_NET461&amp;x-client-ver=5.3.0.0\">TURAS Learn Website</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are 5 learning outcomes aligned to Quality Standards for Practice Learning (QSPL) and HCPC Standards of Education and Training (SETs)</li>\n<li>Learning in each unit takes approximately 1-2 hours to complete.

Personal Academic Tutors </strong></p>\n<p>Personal Academic Tutors (PAT) act as the first point of contact for an identified group of students and practice educators throughout each practice placement.  The PAT offers support throughout the placements, responding to initial requests for advice and support from practice educators and their students, normally within 24 hours (PAT’s working days).</p>\n<p>Support is offered face-face, via email, telephone, or Skype, or video conferencing.  If a student’s performance is causing concern on any practice placement at the request of the practice educator and/or student, a visit can be arranged.   A student may be visited on more than one occasion.   The PAT records all communications, and follow–up actions agreed upon with practice educators and students.   Copies of completed reports are retained in the student’s file and the Professional Practice Tutor/ Programme Leader are kept informed of any issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Hub </strong></p>\n<p>The Hub Practice Education Area houses a bank of useful practice-based learning resources and materials for students.   Resources include web links, sources of accommodation for placements, handbooks, assessment forms, templates for reflection and reading materials.</p>\n<p>The Hub provides a forum for group support, and communication throughout each of the practice placements.   Students participate in on-line discussions facilitated by their Personal Academic Tutors at designated points throughout each placement.  Guidance on how to prepare for, and participate in these on-line discussions is given in preparatory sessions held at the University.   Activities are designed to promote a community of learners and facilitate the development of students’ self-assessment skills, fostering attitudes which value continuing professional development.   Personal Academic Tutors encourage active knowledge sharing amongst the cohort through the use of peer-generated feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Drop–in practice placement surgeries</strong></p>\n<p>Drop-in sessions organised by the Professional Practice Tutor (PPT) are held in the University or online at varying points throughout each practice placement.   Students are encouraged to attend these sessions and share successes and issues they are experiencing on placement.   The PPT acts as a facilitator and along with fellow students, listens and provides support/ advice to peers. </p>\n<p><strong>Complaints and problems on placement</strong></p>\n<p>If a student is experiencing difficulties on practice placement or needs to discuss any aspect of the placement with a member of academic staff they are advised to contact either their Personal Academic Tutor or the Professional Practice Tutor initially. Students may choose to discuss problems of a personal nature with their Practice Educator, or to contact their Personal Academic Tutor.</p>\n<p>Where an incident occurs outside of normal working hours, where there is an urgent need to contact the University, please telephone: (0131)-474-0000. When prompted ask for reception.</p>\n<p><strong>Student counselling service</strong></p>\n<p>Students experiencing any personal difficulties while on placement are encouraged to use the University Student Counselling Service or any of the other Student Services resources.   These services are confidential and sessions can be arranged to suit the student’s timetable.   All students are welcome to use the services, which can also provide information on other sources of help that may be more appropriate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"/study-here/student-services/\" title=\"Student Service Website\">Student Services website</a> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Practice placement debriefing workshops</strong></p>\n<p>Practice placement debriefing workshops, facilitated by the University Professional Practice Tutor are held at the concluding phase of each placement offering students a further opportunity to integrate the experience of practice placement context with the learning environment of the University.   Students are encouraged to use the Placement Resume Form to review their personal and professional development with the Professional Practice Tutor, discuss relevant issues, and prepare for future practice placements.</p>\n<p>Individual debriefing meetings are offered by the Professional Practice Tutor to students who have experienced challenges, ill health, or have failed a placement.</p>"

However, there have been occurrences where social media has been used for less positive reasons, or for a substantial length of time during practice placement, hence the need for this guidance to support responsible usage.</p>\n<p>Health and social care professionals could be putting their registration at risk if posting inappropriate comments about service users and colleagues or posting any material that could be considered explicit. The Health and Care Professions Council (no date), and the College of Occupational Therapists (COT  2015d) have both produced statements/briefings  on the use of social media.

    "content": "<p>Practice educators and students have access to paper-based, and electronic copies of the practice placement assessment forms. These can be used throughout the placement as a basis for discussion between to help students with self-reflection on their own performance.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the assessment process is to:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To generate feedback for students about their performance;</li>\n<li>To identify strengths and weaknesses in the student’s professional practice and modify learning accordingly;</li>\n<li>To provide a basis for discussion in relation to the student’s performance;</li>\n<li>To provide a documented record of students’ level of competence in relation to their stage of education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assessment of learning on practice placements may be by direct observation, discussion, written evidence, feedback from colleagues, service users, carers,  and the student’s own self- evaluation.</p>\n<p><strong>Mid way review (formative assessment)</strong></p>\n<p>The midway review takes the form of a discussion between the practice educator, and the student highlighting areas of progress across the specific University learning outcomes for each placement.   It guides the actions to be taken by the practice educator, and student during the remainder of the placement.   Areas requiring further development and priorities to be addressed in the second half of the placement should be highlighted, agreed and documented in the “development plan” section of the Assessment Form.</p>\n<p>Midway review comments must be signed, and dated by both practice educator and student.</p>\n<p><strong>Final evaluation (summative assessment)</strong></p>\n<p>The final evaluation should be completed at least one day before the end of the practice placement and discussed with the student.   This provides the student with the opportunity to review the report before signing it and returning it to the practice educator. </p>\n<p>Practice educators <u>must</u> refer to the University Grade Descriptors when completing the final evaluation.   Detailed grade descriptors, A*-F are available in each of the practice placement assessment forms.   In making a judgement, it is important to bear in mind the extent to which the placement has given the opportunity to demonstrate the criterion being considered, and what can be realistically expected from students in relation to their stage of the programme</p>\n<p>Mark a cross on each horizontal line to indicate the student’s level of performance for each of the criteria.</p>\n<p>Where a particular criterion is not applicable to the practice setting, or where the student has not been assessed on a particular criterion, then N/A should be inserted in the grid.   We ask that practice educators document the reason(s) for lack of opportunity in the “practice educator’s comments” section.</p>\n<p>Students must pass all University learning outcomes for each practice placement.   All of the criteria for each learning outcome must be passed to achieve an overall pass grade for practice placement.</p>\n<p>Practice educators must provide written comments in the “final evaluation “section along with a suggested development plan for future practice.   This must be signed and dated by the practice educator .</p>\n<p>Students <u>must </u>prepare for the final evaluation, by completing the “student’s comments”.   Comments must be signed and dated by the student</p>\n<p><strong>Final evaluation: service user feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Service user comments (if available) should be recorded in the “service user comments” section.   Students are encouraged to consider service users’ perspective on their performance as this is good professional practice.  This will always be a voluntary process for the service user.   Students should always discuss with their practice educator before approaching a service user for feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Compiling the assessment form</strong></p>\n<p>The following list of points is intended to assist practice educators in the compilation of the assessment forms. </p>\n<p>Feedback should be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Individualised and relevant</strong><em>, </em>demonstrating attention to the particular development needs of the student, rather than comparing with or generalising to other students.</li>\n<li><strong>Goal-directed</strong><strong>, </strong>providing assistance and increased understanding of what is expected or required, with a focus on the needs of the clients and relationship to the learning goals of the student.   At the mid-way appraisal learning objectives may need modification or new ones developed.   It is helpful to summarise the key points in the practice educators’ comments section in the form of a development/action plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Behaviour-focused</strong>, rather than personality focused.   Feedback that refers to what the student does, allows scope for change.</li>\n<li><strong>Respectful</strong><strong>, </strong>demonstrating mindfulness of acceptable boundaries, respecting confidentiality and using language that is non-judgemental.</li>\n<li><strong>Balanced</strong>, comment on strengths and what the student did well with areas of weakness or that require further growth.   Written feedback should be constructive and structured so that students are clear about specific aspects of their performance requiring further development and/or improvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborative</strong><em>, </em>inviting student involvement and agreement in identifying strengths and weaknesses, in seeking solutions, reaching conclusions and formulating plans for future action, facilitating self-evaluation.</li>\n<li><strong>Change focused (non-evaluative</strong>), exploring specific strategies to maintain strengths and improve weaknesses and facilitating a problem-solving approach that highlights the consequences both positive and negative of particular behaviours or actions.   Encourage improvement with practical and specific suggestionsand evidence required from the student to demonstrate further achievement.</li>\n<li><strong>Factual (not generalised</strong>), providing evidence-based examples based on observed performance that highlight actual strengths and weaknesses of modifiable behaviours that have been observed.   Provide specific suggestions for improvements to what students are doing, or occasions where positive behaviour was demonstrated, and discussing outcomes of each behaviour.</li>\n<li><strong>Aligned</strong> to the university grade descriptors.   Check for congruence between written comments and the actual grade(s) awarded</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Awarding an overall grade for students’ performance during practice placement</strong></p>\n<p>Assessment forms are graded in the range A*-F according to the Queen Margaret University criteria for undergraduate modules (QMU, 2021).   In assigning an overall grade, practice educators are expected to refer to the <u>University Grade Descriptors</u> provided in the assessment forms and identify the final grade awarded by circling <u>one</u> of the grades on the front page of the assessment form.</p>\n<p>A student awarded a grade D or above by the practice educator, is considered to be safe in practice and will pass the placement.   The final grade is subsequently converted into a percentage by the Professional Practice Tutor in line with University grade to mark conversion rules. (QMU, 2021).</p>\n<p>Practice educators should always bear in mind that they are making a judgement about the students performance in relation to what is reasonably expected of a student <u>at that level of the programme</u> and not in comparison with a qualified occupational therapist.</p>\n<p><strong>Grade A*: Pass - Outstanding Performance </strong></p>\n<p>In allocating this grade the practice educator is recognising an outstanding performance.   For the level of the programme an outstanding, exceptionally able, safe performance consistently demonstrated throughout the whole of the practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Grade A: Pass - Excellent Performance</strong></p>\n<p>In allocating this grade the practice educator is recognising an excellent performance.   For the level of the programme, an excellent, safe performance, consistently demonstrated throughout the whole of the practice placement</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Grade B: Pass - Very good performance </strong></p>\n<p>In allocating this grade the practice educator is recognising a very good performance. For the level of the programme, a very good, safe performance, consistently demonstrated throughout the majority of the placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Grade C: Pass - Good performance</strong></p>\n<p>In allocating this grade the practice educator is recognising a good performance. For the level of the programme, a good, safe performance consistently demonstrated for the majority of the placement. </p>\n<p><strong>Grade D: Pass - Satisfactory performance</strong></p>\n<p>In allocating this grade the practice educator is recognising a satisfactory performance.  For the level of the programme a satisfactory, safe, performance consistently demonstrated for the second half of the placement. Additional engagement may be required to sustain and enhance performance in subsequent practice placements.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A student who is awarded an overall  grade D or above, is considered to be safe in practice and will pass the placement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Grade E: Fail - Unsatisfactory performance</strong></p>\n<p>In allocating this grade the practice educator is recognising an unsatisfactory performance<strong> f</strong>or the level of the programme. Learner may show some attempt to address issues in the practice setting, but does not meet the criteria outlined for an acceptable performance in several areas of practice.   Shows very limited ability to learn from previous experience.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Grade F: Fail – Unsatisfactory performance</strong></p>\n<p>In allocating this grade the practice educator is recognising an unsatisfactory performance.   There is an unsatisfactory attempt to address issues in the practice setting and learner does not meet the criteria outlined for an acceptable performance in a significant number of areas of practice.   Shows little or no ability to learn from previous experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Guidance for awarding an A*, or A grade </strong></p>\n<p>A student may achieve higher grades in the practice placement modules than in the university-based modules.   Occasionally this may be an inaccurate representation due to:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pressure from the student to increase the grades;</li>\n<li>Wishing to reward the student for fitting in to the placement area particularly well;</li>\n<li>Misinterpretation of the University Grade Descriptors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following is a list of points to assist in the evaluation process:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep written records of A* and A standard performance in the core areas. These might have been observed by the practice educator or reported by other members of staff;</li>\n<li>Ask the student to provide his/her own examples of A* and A standard performance;</li>\n<li>If the student is achieving the equivalent of an A* or A standard performance at the midway review stage, or final  evaluation, contact the University and ask to speak with the Professional Practice Tutor;</li>\n<li>Keep students informed of this process so that they are aware they need to consistently demonstrate evidence of an A* or A standard performance<strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is hoped that these guidelines will ensure greater rigour in the allocation of an A* or A grade, contributing towards the assessment process by providing a second objective viewpoint.  Ultimately it is the practice educator’s responsibility to evaluate the student’s performance, and allocate a grade that represents the abilities and aptitudes of the student in relation to the University marking criteria. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Practice educators experiencing difficulties reaching a final decision are actively encouraged to contact the Professional Practice Tutors at Queen Margaret University</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Practice placement time cards</strong></p>\n<p>Attendance is monitored by the student’s Practice Educator throughout the placement, and all absences from placement must be recorded on the student’s Time Cards, <u>and</u> the relevant section of the Assessment Form.   These records are taken into account when testimonies, or references are provided for students.</p>\n<p>Student recorded time is from that start of the shift until the end of the shift (as approved by the practice educator). Lunch breaks are excluded.Minutes should be rounded up/down to nearest 30 minutes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Important!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> </strong><strong>Hours accrued in failed practice placements, cannot compensate for time lost in subsequent placements (RCOT, 2019).</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Absence of a written record of the appropriate number of practice placement hours may result in students having to complete extra placement hours prior to graduation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to support a student at risk of failing a practice placement</strong></p>\n<p>Whilst being relatively rare, students failing practice placements does happen and can be a very stressful situation for all concerned. These guidelines are aimed at reducing some of the stresses and ensuring that a fair process is in place to help support the student, and practice educator concerned.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>In failing a practice placement, a student is being made aware that for whatever reason s/he has failed to reach a satisfactory standard in the required learning outcomes for the practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>One of the key aspects in managing this is early detection – the sooner a student’s performance can be identified as not satisfactory then the more opportunity available to the student to attempt redeem the situation.</p>\n<p>Normally, by the midway review, the student needs to be informed that he/she is failing the placement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The word “fail” must be clearly used in this discussion</li>\n<li>All attributes/knowledge gaps where the student is not passing must be clearly indicated to the student and examples must be given by the practice educator</li>\n<li>Practice educator must write in the midway comments sections on the assessment form that the midway review has indicated that the student is failing the placement and list the areas causing concern.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Practice Educator must contact the student’s Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) at Queen Margaret University. A discussion will then ensue to decide the most appropriate form of action to ensure support for both student, and practice educator. </p>\n<p>Whilst each situation will vary and requires to be handled appropriately, there are key aspects as how to best work forward.   Honesty is paramount and requires both Practice Educator and student to be open within the learning relationship. Clarity is important, make sure the student is very clear as to where their weaknesses lies and they might best address these. This will involve the setting of weekly goals/objectives for the rest of the placement so that the student has an agreed plan to move things forward. The student’s PAT can help in any of this process.  The PAT will document agreed actions taken on the Link Lecturer’s Report Form. A copy of this report will be held in the student’s  practice placement file at the University.</p>\n<p><strong>Guiding principles</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inform the student as soon as possible if their performance is causing concern.</li>\n<li>Inform QMU as soon as possible if the student’s performance is causing concern – preferablyno later than the midway review.</li>\n<li>Encourage the student to talk with their PAT at the University at the earliest opportunity.</li>\n<li>Ensure that the student receives honest, non- judgemental feedback which focuses on the key areas causing concern.</li>\n<li>Document these discussions have taken place on the weekly supervision record. Both practice educator and student should sign this.</li>\n<li>Set weekly goals/objectives with the student for the remainder of the placement – making these realistic and achievable.   Write these down on the Learning Agreement and again both Practice Educator and student should sign this.</li>\n<li>Schedule weekly feedback sessions indicating progress on the set goals/objectives and document discussions on the weekly supervision record.</li>\n<li>Encourage the student to use reflection as much as possible to allow them to assess their own performance – giving some focus to where things go well as well as those where performance has not been so good.</li>\n<li>Keep in touch with the student’s PAT at University to feedback on progress.</li>\n<li>If the student has not been able to retrieve their performance by the final evaluation then ensure that all verbal, and written comments are in line with the University grade descriptors so that the student is left with a clear picture of where their performance did not meet expected levels. If deemed appropriate, a member of the University programme team can also be present at this discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Receiving a fail grade on practice placement</strong></p>\n<p>A student who fails a placement is permitted one attempt only to retrieve a failed practice placement module.   Hours accrued during a failed practice placement do not count towards the minimum requirement of 1000 hours (RCOT 2019a).  If the module is ultimately failed, and retrieval processes for the module have been exhausted then the student will be asked to withdraw from the named award.   A student may also be denied the opportunity to retrieve the module if the failure originally occurred on grounds of professional unsuitability (RCOT, 2019a).</p>\n<p>The Professional Practice Tutor offers an individual appointment to every student who has failed a placement, to discuss and prepare for the retrieval of a failed placement.  </p>\n<p><strong>Discontinuation of a practice placement</strong></p>\n<p>Discontinuation of a placement is a rare event, however it can occur and each situation is unique.  It is important that all involved in this decision be as objective as possible, are clear about the relevant evidence that they have, follow the relevant procedures, seek advice and record decisions and outcomes.</p>\n<p>A placement may be terminated for reasons related to the student, reasons related to the practice educator, reasons related to the placement site, or a combination of all of these.</p>\n<p>Reasons related to the student</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professional conduct</li>\n<li>Issues related to competency and/or fitness to practise</li>\n<li>Risk assessment has identified serious and likely risk of the student causing harm to themselves, and/or service users/carers</li>\n<li>Health and safety issues and mandatory programme requirements</li>\n<li>Personal issues</li>\n<li>Service- user or carer related</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reasons related to the practice educator</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practice educator competency, and/or conduct issues</li>\n<li>Personal issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reason related to the placement site</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staffing shortages</li>\n<li>Service user related issues</li>\n<li>Outbreak of infectious disease</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where this is the case the University should be notified at the earliest opportunity so that an appropriate action plan can be developed. </p>\n<p>Possible actions might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Placement continues with extra support from the placement provider, and the University;</li>\n<li>Another Practice Educator is able to facilitate the placement for the student in the same area;</li>\n<li>Another Practice Educator is able to facilitate the placement for the student in a different area;</li>\n<li>The placement terminated is taken at another time dependant upon made by the Board of Examiner;</li>\n<li>In the instance of a pass standard being unachievable, resulting in a failed practice placement, consultation between the student, Professional Practice Tutor, and Programme Leader will take place to determine the most appropriate way forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Deferring a practice placement</strong></p>\n<p>Students who are unable for legitimate reasons to undertake the placement at the allotted time will have a placement arranged at a deferred time.  This will count as a first attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>Scheduling of a deferred or retrieval practice placement</strong></p>\n<p>Normally, a retrieval, or deferred practice placement takes place over the summer before the student progresses to the next level of the programme.   Ultimately, this is dependent upon decisions taken by the Board of Examiners, and the availability of an appropriate practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong>Student evaluation of practice placements</strong></p>\n<p>At the conclusion of each placement students complete an Evaluation of Placement Form offering constructive feedback to the practice educator, the placement provider, and the University to enable ongoing enhancement of the learning environment.  A copy of this form is retained by the placement provider.  The signed original copy must  be returned the University by the student.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessment paper work submission</strong></p>\n<p>Students are responsible for ensuring the submission of completed assessment forms to the University. The Assessment Form, and Student Evaluation of Placement Form must be submitted by the student to the drop boxes in the University virtual learning environment (Hub) within five working days of completion of placement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Important!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> </strong><strong>Practice educators are asked to ensure that students are given a fully signed copy of the completed Assessment Form and Student Evaluation of Placement Form before leaving the placement site.</strong></p>\n<p>Students must retain copies of completed paperwork for their own records before submission  to the School Office.The practice-based learning team cannot respond to requests from students for copies of completed paperwork at a later date.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>At the conclusion of each placement, students retain their Learning Agreement in their Portfolio. They must also securely store their  practice placement time cards as these may be required to validate placement hours at any time during the programme. </p>\n<p><strong>Appeals procedure</strong></p>\n<p>A student wishing to appeal against a decision about a grade received for practice placement may do so by following the procedures, and practices set out in the Academic Appeals Regulations (QMU, 2014a).
