You can exit at different points but single module study is not available.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching, learning and assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching includes practical and academic elements with an emphasis on experiential and interpersonal learning and teaching methods, including lectures, seminars and tutorials. Practice education is supported by regular supervision at QMU. Students are not required to cover the cost for supervision at University or on placement.</p>\n<p>Assessments are varied and include practical and written formats as well as short video, poster and case work presentations. Personal development is fundamental to therapeutic training and it is a requirement of the HCPC that students attend regular personal psychotherapy throughout the course, with a minimum of 40 hours of attendance. Personal therapy is not assessed and students are required to cover the cost. Independent study is in addition to this, as well as days specifically for practice-based learning: one day/week in year one and two days/ week in year two.</p>\n<p><strong>Placements (Practice education)</strong></p>\n<p>Practice-based learning is ongoing throughout the course. In Year One, practice education is usually with a music therapist, one day per week from October to March. In Year Two, you attend practice education two days per week throughout both semesters and work in a more autonomous way.</p>\n<p>The range of practice placements are extensive including placements within hospitals, schools, voluntary sector organisations, child and family centres, drug and alcohol services, hospices, community based health centres, community based mental health teams, day centres for the elderly and for adults with physical and/or learning disabilities. The range of practice placements for Music Therapy students changes from year to year.</p>\n<p>Practice-based learning can also be arranged further afield if students choose to commute; the course has excellent partnerships with practice education providers across the UK, Ireland and Gibraltar. Students do not need to find their own placements: practice placements are organised by the Professional Practice Tutor at QMU.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching hours and attendance</strong></p>\n<p>Each module requires attendance of classes at QMU: typically, Year One students attend QMU on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and in Year Two, classes are on a Thursday. Practice placement days and independent study are in addition to this.</p>\n<p><strong>Class sizes</strong></p>\n<p>There are (maximum) 25 places for each cohort. </p>\n<p><strong>Teaching staff</strong></p>\n<p>You can read more about the teaching staff on this course at the bottom of this page.

You should be able to demonstrate a high degree of skill and flexibility on at least one instrument. You do not need to be able to read Western musical notation. We are committed to enabling and widening access for musicians from diverse backgrounds.</p>\n<p>You will also have a minimum of one year’s experience of relevant work experience with persons in the community, education or health settings. Some experience of personal music therapy or psychodynamic psychotherapy, or experiential workshops in creative therapies is desirable.</p>\n<p>International: You will be required to provide evidence of English language competence at no less than IELTS 7.0, and with no individual component score less than 6.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Other requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to produce a personal statement.

Please include an outline of any texts you have read in preparation for this course. We would also like to hear about your own relationship with music and how this has shaped your decision to apply. In addition, please detail any relevant experience within caring professions, which does not need to be music related, and highlight particular qualities you feel you would bring to the course.</li>\n<li>Applicants will be asked to attend interview and audition (see below).</li>\n<li>A satisfactory criminal records check from the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme, an occupational health check and personal indemnity insurance (normally through membership of the professional body) are required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The application process</strong></p>\n<p>You are asked to include several documents with your application and must include a personal statement following these guidelines above.

The audition is your chance to demonstrate your breadth of musicianship: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please prepare a short piece on two different instruments (or two contrasting pieces if you are playing one instrument)</li>\n<li>If you don’t use your voice in these pieces, you are also required to sing a short song</li>\n<li>Please be ready to improvise as directed on the day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We would recommend you bring your own instrument for the audition but larger instruments such as a clarsach, a piano, drum kit and guitars are available to play. Please <a href=\"mailto:therapy@qmu.ac.uk\">email the Music Therapy team</a> for any other queries.</p>\n<p>The interview aims to assess your personal suitability for the profession, your ability to reflect and readiness for the demands that the course entails. Members of the course team will be interested in talking to you about your personal statement.  </p>\n<p>When the interview and audition is conducted online, you will be asked to prepare for the audition and interview in the same way, but there is no group component.</p>\n<p>Applicants are advised of the outcome of their interview via the Admissions team within a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>Other information</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost of the PVG check (£18 or £59 depending on the level of clearance required*) and the professional indemnity insurance are the responsibility of the student.

These may be on campus or online and are your opportunity to speak to meet with lecturers and current students from the MSc Music Therapy. Please check the <a href=\"/open-days-and-meeting-us/postgraduate-open-events/\">Postgraduate Open Days</a> page on the QMU website for forthcoming dates or follow @QMUMusicTherapy for notifications via Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I apply?</strong></p>\n<p>Applications are made online. Please click the ‘Apply to this course’ button on the top right of this page.</p>\n<p><strong>When should I apply?</strong></p>\n<p>Applications can be made from October of each year for the following September. Applicants are advised to apply as soon as possible and before the 1st May, although late applicants will be considered. Places fill up on a first come first served basis. If your application is successful, and the course is full, you will be offered a place on a waiting list.</p>\n<p><strong>When are interviews?</strong></p>\n<p>If your application is successful, you will be invited to interview at the University. They normally take place between January and June. For more information, contact: <a href=\"mailto:admissions@qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"Contact Admissions\">admissions@qmu.ac.uk</a> </p>\n<p><strong>What is the mode of attendance?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two fifteen-week semesters in each year: September – December; January – May.</p>\n<p>In Year One students attend two days at University (Tuesday and Wednesday) and one day (any other day, Mon-Fri) each week on practice placement.</p>\n<p>In Year Two students attend one day at University (Thursday) and two days each week on practice placement (any other days, Mon-Fri).</p>\n<p><strong>Can I work at the same time?</strong></p>\n<p>Although attendance at University and practice placement is part-time (3 days/ week in each year) the course is full-time so you are required to make up the hours for independent study (equivalent to 2 days/ week).</p>\n<p><strong>Can I do the course by distance-learning?</strong></p>\n<p>Some aspects of the course can be studied online and there is much self-directed study. However, attendance at University is compulsory due to the necessity of interpersonal and experiential components.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a part-time route to MSc Music Therapy?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no part-time route at the moment. It is offered as a full-time 2-year, fast-track pre-registration (HCPC) course.</p>\n<p><strong>Who organises practice placements?</strong></p>\n<p>Practice Placements are arranged and allocated by the Professional Practice Tutor at QMU. Students are not expected to find their own placements. Before Year One and Two, students are invited to complete a form to indicate choice, previous experience and address during Semesters. Wherever possible, practice placements are arranged in, or near to, the city where the student lives but this is also balanced by each student’s learning needs and preferences, which are all taken into consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Are all the practice placements in Scotland?</strong></p>\n<p>We have approved placement sites in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Aberdeen and many other areas in Scotland, but also in England, Northern Ireland and Ireland. Students are placed in a site that we consider will offer the best learning experience. Our good links with managers at various practice placement settings around the UK and Ireland mean that we can aim to offer all students a placement that makes sense geographically.</p>\n<p><strong>What kinds of practice placements are offered?</strong></p>\n<p>The range of practice placements are extensive including placements within hospitals, schools, voluntary sector organisations, child and family centres, drug and alcohol services, hospices, community based health centres, community based mental health teams, day centres for the elderly and for adults with physical and/or learning disabilities. The range of practice placements for Music Therapy students changes from year to year.</p>\n<p><strong>Who supervises practice placement?</strong></p>\n<p>In Year One, all students are usually supervised by a music therapist who works on-site. In Year Two, students have the opportunity to work more autonomously and often in a setting where there has previously been no Music Therapy. They are supervised by another professional who works in the setting.</p>\n<p>All students receive regular clinical supervision at University in small groups and attendance to these is a co-requisite of practice placement.</p>\n<p><strong>When should I start personal psychotherapy?</strong></p>\n<p>Students are required to attend personal psychodynamic psychotherapy for the duration of the MSc Music Therapy course (as all HCPC registered courses in the UK) and to show evidence of at least 40 hours throughout the 2-year course. Responsibility for finding a therapist rests with the student and ideally should be in place for the start of the course.</p>\n<p>In general students are advised to work with a therapist whose orientation is compatible with the psychodynamic orientation of the course, with a minimum of 5 years’ experience, and registered with UKCP or BACP. Further details are given when students matriculate.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the course fees? </strong></p>\n<p>See the Fees and Funding button on the course website for fees and updated information on possible student funding.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any other costs?</strong></p>\n<p>All students are required to have occupational health checks before beginning the first practice placement and this is a one-off payment.  </p>\n<p><strong>Are there grants, trusts or scholarships for the course ?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no grants available but international students can apply for a QMU scholarship. Some students have sought funding from other sources by consulting information on Education Awards in their local library. Other students have obtained a Career Development Loan from their bank, or received part funding from their employers.</p>\n<p><strong>Do full fees need to be paid at the outset of the academic year?</strong></p>\n<p>No, there are other options. See the QMU website for further details.  </p>\n<p><strong>What sort of tutorial support is available to students? </strong></p>\n<p>Each student on the course has a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT). The role of the Personal Academic Tutor is to help students integrate the different parts of the course, review their work and be aware of any circumstances affecting the student’s learning on the course.
