    "content": "<p>The course includes multiple Scotland-wide practice placements and on completion you will be able to apply for full registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) to work as a podiatrist.</p>\n<p>As a podiatrist you will be a healthcare professional who has been trained to diagnose and treat abnormal conditions of the feet and lower limbs. Podiatrists work with their patients to prevent and correct deformity, keeping people mobile and active, and helping to relieve pain. Podiatrists work with people of all ages, and your patients will count on you to support and help them with a broad range of mobility and medical conditions of the foot and lower limbs. These may include muscular and joint problems as well as broader health issues such as diabetes, blood disorders and disorders of the nervous system, which may involve complex wound management.</p>\n<p>The Year One modules include introductions to anatomy and physiology. You will be prepared for clinical practice by developing your communication skills and exploring the professional requirements to allow you to become a podiatrist and to work as part of a team. This will involve you developing key skills to allow you to begin your professional development journey as a podiatrist. In addition, you will reconsolidate existing research skills including essay writing and how to access information to support your learning. An early introduction to podiatry in the form of learning about clinical practice on placement provides the opportunity to allow you to integrate into the clinical environment. You will undertake modules that explore human walking and musculoskeletal problems. You will continue to broaden your understanding of health and wellbeing and how to influence and facilitate behaviour change. You will learn about medicine and pharmacology and the impact they can have on the lower limb. You will continue to develop your practical skills through further supported clinical placement.</p>\n<p>Year Two modules are designed to enhance your critical thinking, research skills and further develop your knowledge of foot and ankle imaging modalities. You will be broadening your healthcare awareness and challenging your understanding of health education and promotion, as well as developing your key skills in working as part of a multidisciplinary team. You will continue to link theory and practice during a range of clinical placement opportunities including advanced practice. Through a variety of placement opportunities you will enhance, consolidate and reflect on your theoretical learning to date. You will continue to develop your skills in research, professional development and current/advanced clinical skills enabling a smooth transition to working life. You will explore leadership skills and innovative practice to meet contemporary healthcare challenges in podiatry. You will complete your academic learning by undertaking appropriate and focused research activities.</p>\n<p>We aim for all our graduates to be confident in their own professional identity and have the additional skills that will allow you to work as an effective multidisciplinary team member. This is the reason why we have implemented an interprofessional working focus within all of our healthcare courses, including this one.</p>"
