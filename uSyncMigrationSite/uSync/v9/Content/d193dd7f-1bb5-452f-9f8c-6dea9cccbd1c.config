The timelines for developing and approving a new programme are set out in detail in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Programme development, monitoring and review</strong></span> section.</p>\n<p>To allow for marketing and inclusion in the prospectus, new programmes should have completed Part 3 approval through the School Academic Board as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undergraduate programmes - 22 months before the start of the academic year.</li>\n<li>Postgraduate programmes - 18 months before the start of the academic year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It may be possible to develop new collaborative programmes more quickly but it is best to allow a full year for all the stages of planning, approval and validation.</p>\n<p>2.  A major change to a programme should be proposed 12 months before it is due to take effect. Similarly, programme teams should start the process of reviewing a programme 12 months before the next intake is due.</p>\n<p>3. External examiners are normally appointed for 4 years and 3 months, eg from September 2022 to December 2026. This allows for a period of overlap between examiners. The process for nominating an examiner is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>six months prior to starting post - programme committee approves and passes to School Academic Board.</li>\n<li>five months prior - School Academic Board recommends nomination to Learning and Teaching Panel.</li>\n<li>four months prior - Learning and Teaching Panel considers nomination and recommends appointment on behalf of Student Experience Committee / Senate.</li>\n<li>three months prior - contract sent to Examiner by HR/GQE. Programme Leader sends programme specific information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.  Annual programme monitoring</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programme team reflect on previous academic year in June.</li>\n<li>Part 1 submitted by 30 June.</li>\n<li>Additional data received over summer and after retrieval boards. Statistical information sent to programme leaders in October.</li>\n<li>Draft of final report agreed by programme committee (may be by correspondence).</li>\n<li>Final report submitted 31 October.</li>\n<li>Composite School reports drafted in January.</li>\n<li>Composite School report agreed by School Academic Board in February.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Collaborative programmes should allow time for consultation with the Collaborative Academic Lead before submitting Part 1 or Part 2 reports.
