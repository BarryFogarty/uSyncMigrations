      <Value><![CDATA[<p><strong>2   Admissions principles</strong></p>
<p>2.1   The University seeks to provide access to its courses from as wide a range of entrants as possible, subject to the essential principle that entrants have a reasonable expectation of completing their course successfully within the normal duration of the course.</p>
<p>2.2   This principle is codified through:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">University-wide general minimum entrance requirements specified by level of course.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Specific entrance requirements for each course framed to apply the University’s general entrance requirements to the particular needs of that course.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Clear provisions and procedures for the admission of students who do not meet these normal entrance requirements, but who fulfil the essential principle set out in point 2.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.3   Queen Margaret University is committed to equality of opportunity. We seek to promote diversity amongst our students, staff and applicants. We recognise the particular contributions that are made by individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, to the achievement of our vision and strategic objectives. We aim to promote entry to, and provide education at, undergraduate and postgraduate level to a diverse range of students, whatever their background. Our equal opportunities policy is available on our website.</p>
<p>2.4   Each application received by the University is considered carefully on its own merits, taking into account educational, professional and personal experience.</p>
<p>In assessing candidates for admittance to the University, we are committed to the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fairness</strong> – the University strives to use admissions assessment methods that are reliable and valid.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> – details of our entry requirements are published in our prospectus and on our website, and are clear and transparent to applicants and their advisers.</li>
<li><strong>Reflecting our community</strong> – we are committed to admitting as wide a range of applicants as possible to reflect our community.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging participation</strong> – we aim to minimise barriers to applicants and encourage progression and retention through our targeted pre-entry, transition and post-entry support services.</li>
</ul>]]></Value>

We take a professional approach to admissions.</p>\n<p>3.2     The University ensures a wide range of pre-entry and outreach activities are available to applicants and stakeholders, along with individual advice and guidance.</p>\n<p>3.3     Admissions, student recruitment and outreach &amp; community engagement staff receive regular training, support and guidance to ensure that they provide accurate, timely and consistent advice and guidance to applicants and other stakeholders.</p>\n<p>3.4     A range of staff, including the Transition and Pre-entry Adviser, College Articulation Officer, Student Funding Adviser and the Disability Team are available to ensure that potential students obtain all the relevant information required, so they are appropriately informed during their decision making process to come to the University.</p>\n<p>3.5     Academic admissions tutors work closely with recruitment and admissions staff to ensure that entry requirements are fair and transparent.</p>\n<p>3.6     Staff in admissions are trained and supported to ensure that they are able to make fair and equitable admissions decisions.</p>\n<p>3.7     We aim to process applications as quickly as possible. However, where there is an application deadline, applications may not be processed until after the deadline in order to ensure equal consideration.</p>\n<p>3.8     Offers of admission are communicated to applicants in clear and easy to understand language.</p>\n<p>3.9     We recognise the importance of providing feedback to unsuccessful applicants. Where an applicant is unsuccessful, we give a reason for this via UCAS for undergraduate applicants or by email for postgraduate applicants. While the University aims to provide informative feedback that is helpful to applicants, it may not always be possible to provide highly specific or tailored advice.</p>\n<p>3.10   If the University makes a change to a course, which is deemed to impact significantly on the student, or withdraws a course after an application has been received, we will email applicants to explain the reason for the change or withdrawal and offer advice and guidance about alternative courses, either at QMU or elsewhere.</p>"

All part time applications and applications for postgraduate courses should be made directly to the University using our on-line application form, accessible through each course page.</p>\n<p>6.2<strong>   </strong>All UCAS applications received by the published UCAS deadline are given equal consideration. Postgraduate applicants are encouraged to submit applications as early as possible. Where a programme has a specific deadline, this will be clearly published in the prospectus and on the course pages of our website. Postgraduate programmes which have limited numbers of places may become full before a published deadline has been reached. In such cases, the programme will be closed and any applicants waiting for a decision will be informed as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>6.3   A number of courses require interviews or auditions as part of the application procedure. Where an interview or audition forms part of the selection criteria, we stipulate this in our prospectus and on our website. Arrangements are made to interview applicants by telephone or Skype where travel to the UK is not possible.</p>\n<p>We explain to applicants the nature and purpose of the interview and ensure that interviews are conducted fairly by appropriately qualified staff.</p>\n<p>6.4<strong>   </strong>A number of courses require the inspection of a portfolio of work. Full details of these requirements are published in our prospectus and on our website.</p>\n<p>6.5   Where applicants have made more than one application to study, decisions will be made separately.</p>\n<p>6.6   Applicants may be offered an alternative programme of study if they do not meet the minimum entry requirements for their chosen programme.</p>\n<p>6.7   Where applicants are required to provide photocopies of their qualifications with their application, we may require sight of the original documentation at matriculation. Applicants will be notified in advance of matriculation if this is required.</p>\n<p>6.8   We allow applicants to defer entry to most of our programmes for one year. UCAS applicants wishing to defer are required to meet all the conditions for entry in the year that they apply. Postgraduate applicants can defer a conditional offer. An applicant can only defer the offer of a place once, and after that they will be asked to reapply unless in exceptional circumstances. Where it is not possible to defer an offer of study, an applicant can reapply the following academic year.</p>\n<p>6.9   Where an applicant has extenuating circumstances, we take this into consideration. However, where these circumstances have affected the grade achieved in a qualification required for entry, we would expect that this is dealt with by the examining body.</p>"

    "content": "<p>7.1     General entry requirements</p>\n<p>7.1.1  All courses have prescribed entry requirements relating to previous academic attainment. The minimum entry requirements for each course are published each year in our prospectus and on our website.</p>\n<p>7.1.2<strong>  </strong>Achieving the minimum entry standards does not guarantee an offer of a place on a course as there can be considerable competition for places.</p>\n<p>7.1.3    For all courses we look for evidence of motivation, suitability, skills and attitudes. For programmes which lead to eligibility for professional registration we also expect applicants to demonstrate an exploration of the profession within their personal statement.       </p>\n<p>7.1.4<strong>    </strong>If an applicant does not have the normal entry requirements, but has relevant experience and can demonstrate that there is a reasonable expectation that they will complete the course, then it may still be possible to consider them.</p>\n<p>We recommend that applicants who have no formal qualifications, or have been out of formal education for some time, contact admissions to discuss appropriate pathways to study.</p>\n<p>7.2    Undergraduate entry requirements</p>\n<p>7.2.1<strong>   </strong>The University accepts a wide range of qualifications for entry. We set our entry standards for Scottish Highers, A Levels and Irish Leaving Certificate using the UCAS Tariff as a metric to ensure equity. We also consider a range of other equivalent qualifications using established bodies such as UCAS and UK ENIC to compare qualifications</p>\n<p>7.2.2<strong>   </strong>Our entry criteria and offers are usually expressed in grades. When making a grade based offer, we will make it clear when we expect those grades to be achieved by. Applicants are expected to achieve the required number of qualifications at specific grades, dependent on the degree programme applied for. We may use the UCAS Tariff to calculate equivalencies for non-standard entry qualifications.</p>\n<p>7.2.3  Where an applicant has attempted a qualification more then once, we normally count the highest grade achieved, but we do not double count the qualification.</p>\n<p>7.2.4<strong>  </strong>The general minimum entrance requirement for an Undergraduate Degree is usually one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least three SQA Highers at grade C or above. Most degrees also require passes in Maths and English at Standard Grade/Int2/ National 5 at grade C or above;</li>\n<li>At least two full A Levels at grade D or above. Most degrees also require passes in Maths and English at CGSE at grade C/ 4, or above;</li>\n<li>The Irish Leaving Certificate with at least three passes in the Higher Level subjects at grade H3 or above;</li>\n<li>Pass in the International Baccalaureate Diploma</li>\n<li>Pass in the European Baccalaureate;</li>\n<li>A BTEC national Diploma at level 3;</li>\n<li>A relevant Access or Foundation course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>7.2.5   Where we have requested Higher English as an entry requirement, we will also accept Higher ESOL as meeting that requirement for all programmes except BA (Hons) Education Studies (Primary).</p>\n<p>7.2.6   Where National 5 Mathematics is required for entry to a course, National 5 Lifeskills Mathematics and National 5 Applications of Mathematics will be considered to meet this criteria, at the required grade.</p>\n<p>7.2.7   The University welcomes the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence. Our entry criteria are largely based on qualifications achieved ‘on entry’ rather than over a particular number of sittings. Published entry requirements for Scottish Highers may be achieved over two or more sittings.</p>\n<p>7.2.8   The University acknowledges that the Curriculum for Excellence gives students the opportunity to take a broader range of qualifications, undertaken at different stages of learning. Some students may progress from general education to Highers, without achieving a National 5 qualification. If you do not hold a subject that is required at National 5, you must have achieved or be predicted to achieve that subject at SQA Higher.</p>\n<p>7.2.9<strong>   </strong>QMU values the Advanced Higher qualification as an excellent preparation for University study, but will only count the highest level of qualification in any subject. This means that we wouldn’t count AS levels or SQA Highers if you have the full A Level, or an Advanced Higher in the same or similar subject.</p>\n<p>7.2.10  We will accept AS level qualifications in addition to the two A Levels. We do not accept A Level General Studies for entry to any of our courses.</p>\n<p>7.2.11<strong>  </strong>We welcome applications from those studying the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), however we recognize that not all students have access to the qualification, so we do not include them within entry requirements, and they do not carry additional credit in the selection process.</p>\n<p>7.2.12  The University welcomes applications from those studying Foundation Apprenticeships. The Foundation Apprenticeship will count as one subject within an applicant’s overall presentation of qualifications. Where specific subjects are required for entry to one of our degree programmes, a Foundation Apprenticeship will not replace that requirement, but will be counted as one of an applicant’s additional subjects.</p>\n<p>7.2.13  The University welcomes and supports students seeking to apply for advanced or direct entry to our undergraduate programmes of study. Applicants must apply through UCAS, by the UCAS deadline in order to be considered for a place.</p>\n<p>Advanced entry may be offered to applicants with evidence of accredited prior learning, such as HNC, HND, Advanced Higher or A Level qualifications. Applicants who wish to be considered for Advanced Entry should state this clearly on their UCAS application, using the Point of Entry box.</p>\n<p>7.2.14   We have established articulation agreements with local colleges. Applicants must apply through UCAS by the UCAS deadline in order to be considered for a place. We aim to place applicants with a relevant HNC into the second year of our courses and those with an HND into the third year of our courses.</p>\n<p>Generally applicants applying for second year entry with an HNC will be required to get a B in their graded unit, while applicants applying for third year entry with an HND will be required to get C/B in their graded units.</p>\n<p>Where advanced entry is not possible, then a relevant HN qualification may be considered for entry into the first year of a programme.</p>\n<p>7.2.15  We also accept a wide range of other qualifications, including diplomas and certificates that equate to SCQF level 7 or 8 for advanced entry. However, the content and level must match that of our courses sufficiently for us to be satisfied that the learning outcomes have been achieved.</p>\n<p>7.2.16<strong>  </strong>We are able to consider accreditation of non certified learning (APL) and we have a rigorous process in place for assessing APL. We are also able to identify, explore and claim academic credit for previous certificated and/or experiential learning through the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) process. For learning to be awarded as credit towards your programme of study, it needs to match learning outcomes and to be evidenced.</p>\n<p>You <strong>may </strong>be able to gain RPL credit for previous certificated study, undertaken elsewhere. You also may be able to gain academic credit for experience; for example experience gained through volunteering, or in your workplace. Please see the <a href=\"http://www.qmu.ac.uk/about-the-university/quality/committees-regulations-policies-and-procedures/regulations-policies-and-procedures\" title=\"Regulations, policies and procedures\">Quality website</a> for further details. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p>7.2.17<strong>  </strong>Students presenting with Advanced Highers or strong A Level grades in relevant subjects may be eligible for entry to the second year of some of our courses<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>7.2.18<strong>  </strong>Admission to the joint degree BA (Hons) Acting for Stage and Screen is via UCAS to Queen Margaret University. The selection process requires an audition.</p>\n<p>7.3    Postgraduate Taught entry requirements</p>\n<p>7.3.1<strong>  </strong>All postgraduate applicants should have already achieved a first degree, normally at Honours level or equivalent, or a professional diploma which is recognised by the relevant professional body as the equivalent of an Honours degree. We may also accept diploma level qualifications and considerable relevant experience.</p>\n<p>7.3.2  Exceptionally, we can accept applicants for postgraduate level study without a first degree for some courses if they have considerable relevant professional experience.</p>\n<p>7.3.3<strong>    </strong>Postgraduate applicants are usually required to provide one reference in support of their application. This will usually be an academic reference, but may be a professional reference where the applicant has been out of education for longer than 3 years. The reference must be presented in one of the following formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On headed paper reflecting the referee's professional standing, signed and dated. This can be posted, scanned and emailed, or handed into the Admissions team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OR</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the form of an email sent to the Admissions team from an email address reflecting the referee's professional standing. Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc. email addresses are not acceptable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>7.3.4<strong>   </strong>For certain postgraduate programmes students can be admitted as ‘associate students’ to allow them to take one or two modules, without registering for an award.</p>\n<p>Applicants will be required to complete an application via the relevant course page on the University’s website, including a short personal statement.</p>\n<p>Normally a student can study as an ‘associate student’ for a maximum period of 2 years, or for 2 modules.</p>\n<p>If a student wishes to register on a named award in a similar area after studying as an ‘associate student’, any modules they have successfully completed may be given as credit towards their named award.</p>\n<p>The commencement date for the period of registration for the named award would be taken from the point when the student first registered as an ‘associate student’.</p>\n<p>If a former ‘associate student’ requires a Student visa in order to study a full time, named award they will be required to complete an application and provide evidence of English language proficiency at the level required for the named award, before they can be issued with a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS).</p>\n<p>7.4    Postgraduate Research entry requirements</p>\n<p>Applicants applying for a PhD by research must provide a proposal. This allows us to check how well the applicant understands the research process and to make sure the topic is in an area we can supervise.</p>\n<p>The research topic must be within the expertise of our staff. The topic must have academic merit and it must be capable of generating new knowledge. Research which is linked to the applicant's creative work may be considered.</p>\n<p>Applications to our PhD research degrees should be made via our Division of Governance and Quality Enhancement. FFull details can be found in the <a href=\"http://www.qmu.ac.uk/post_research/apply.htm\">Research degrees</a> section of the website.</p>\n<p>7.5    International applicants</p>\n<p>7.5.1<strong>  </strong>We welcome applications from international applicants around the world and accept a wide range of international qualifications. We use UK ENIC and other reliable sources to establish equivalences of international qualifications with UK standards of entry, and make offers on a like for like basis. We publish equivalencies for popular overseas qualifications on our website and can offer advice on alternative routes for entry where they do not meet our requirements (such as foundation level courses).</p>\n<p>7.5.2<strong>  </strong>We work with a number of agents who act as official representatives of the University and can assist with advice on applications and suitable course options.</p>\n<p>7.5.3<strong>   </strong>The University has a number of partners overseas through whom students can study for a QMU degree. Minimum entry requirements for such arrangements are the same as those that apply to the course delivered in Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>7.5.4<strong>   </strong>We welcome applications from students who have achieved one of our awards overseas and who wish to continue with further studies at QMU Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>7.5.5<strong>   </strong>Applicants who are non-native speakers of English must demonstrate English language proficiency in all four language competencies. We require a minimum IELTS score of 6.0 with no element below 5.5 or equivalent qualification. For many courses, the minimum score required is higher than this. Information about minimum scores is given in our prospectuses and on the course pages of our website.</p>"
