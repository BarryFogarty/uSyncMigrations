<p>FoISA requires public authorities, including QMU, to maintain a publication scheme that sets out the types of information we routinely make available. The scheme also provides details of how you can access this information, and whether it is available free or if there is a charge.</p>
<p>2. <a data-id="4587" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2b6f21f8fbd0426685d3c3f8c4053869}" title="Submit an FOI Request">Individual Requests</a></p>
<p>FoISA permits the public to request any information held by Scottish public authorities, including QMU. The request does not need to mention FoISA.</p>
<p>3. <a data-id="4586" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7ae966bfe1934326ad0c1da1d6b14a63}" title="Records Management">Records Management</a></p>
<p>Public authorities are required to implement records management policies to ensure effective management of what information they have, where it is kept and how long they keep it. Effective records management is central to FoISA requests. <br /> </p>]]></Value>

A full list of the organisations affected is set out in the Act and further bodies can be added by the Scottish Ministers. FoISA applies to Queen Margaret University because it falls within the category of higher education institutions and is therefore a public authority for the purposes of FoISA.</p>"
