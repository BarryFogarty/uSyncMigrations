      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Children with Down's syndrome present with specific difficulties in speech production making them less intelligible to family and friends. Previous research funded by the Medical Research Council and Baily Tomas Charity at QMU trialled the use of Electropalatography (EPG) as a therapy technique for these specific difficulties with a group of young people with Down's syndrome. This research found that speech intelligibility can be improved using EPG as a therapy tool. This current project is expanding on this finding. However, instead of providing EPG therapy at QMU as previously, we are developing and evaluating a consultative model of intervention, prodiving specialised training to educational support staff who will provide speech input within the child's normal school environment.</p>
<p>The project began in April 2012.</p>]]></Value>

    "title": "Background",
    "content": "<p>Down's syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mild to moderate learning difficulties, affecting 1 in ever 732 live births (Canfield et al., 2006). Speech in DS is poorer than expected in relation to their language and cognitive abilities (Roberts et al., 2007). Speech difficulties can affect speech intelligibility which in turn affects ability to communicate effectively. Many of these speech problems have been found to be resistant to conventional methods of intervention delivered by speech and language therapists (Kumin, 1996).</p>\n<p>Electropalatography (EPG) is a long-established tool for clinical and non-clinical speech research, developed at Queen Margaret University. EPG displays the timing and location of tongue contact with the roof of the mouth during continuous speech production. Each user of EPG has to have a custom-made artificial palate which contains electrodes that register tongue contact. The individual's pattern of tongue contact can be compared with standard patterns of English consonants (such as 't' in 'toe', 's' in 'sun' and 'k' in 'kick').</p>\n<p>EPG can be used to provide detailed information on speech patterns and as a visual feedback technique for therapy. In therapy sessions the children focus on their own speech movements and the resulting EPG patterns on screen. EPG is particularly suited for children with DS for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>visual processing skills are a strength</li>\n<li>People with DS are able to respond better to visual stimuli than verbal instructions .</li>\n<li>Research suggests that children with DS enjoy interacting with computer-generated presentations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous research looking at EPG therapy for children with DS has shown a positive change in speech production and noted potential benefits of EPG therapy over conventional therapy. This new project is hoping to build on the success of previous research and provide alternatives to some of the limitations that were identified.</p>"
