      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Corporate Parenting is as great a privilege as it is a responsibility. As corporate parents, we must ensure that the ways in which we work, independently and in partnership, enhance the wellbeing and outcomes achieved by our care experienced young people. <br />QMU is committed to widening participation amongst students who have previously been inhibited from entering Higher Education for social, economic or cultural reasons and has long recognised the challenges and barriers faced by care experienced young people (CEYP) in progressing on to and successfully completing a University degree.</p>
<p>Our Outreach and Community Engagement (OCE) team seeks to increase student numbers from non-traditional groups including those that are: first generation to go to Higher Education; from low progression schools; reside in communities in the lowest 20% of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (MD20); articulating students from Scotland’s Colleges, or those who are Care Experienced.</p>
<p>OCE aims to ensure that CEYP are fully informed about courses, admissions procedures and the student experience to enable them to make informed choices, and post entry are able to access a range of services such as QM Advance and Direct Entrant Induction Week (induction programmes), QM Connect (mentoring) as well as study skills and finance support.</p>
<p>OCE contributes to a number of collaborative widening participation initiatives that each year support more than 5000 prospective students. In particular, the University is a founding partner in the Lothians Equal Access Programme for Schools (LEAPS), and a partner in the Schools for Higher Education Programme (SHEP), the Edinburgh, Lothians and Fife Regional Articulation Hub (ELRAH) and the Scottish Wider Access Programme (SWAP).</p>
<p>As QMU’s approach to widening participation has broadened, we have been concerned also to deepen our engagement with our communities with a view to raising aspirations at an early age.</p>
<p>We are the first higher education institution in the east of Scotland to host the Children’s University – QMU’s Children’s University aims to promote social mobility by providing high quality, exciting and innovative learning activities and experiences outside normal school hours to children aged 5-14 (and 5 and 6 year olds with their families) and engage the wider communities as learning partners in the realisation of this. At the heart of its work is the ambition to raise aspirations - aspire to inspire - boost achievement and foster a love of learning, so that young people can make the most of their abilities and interests, regardless of the background into which they were born.</p>
<p>As well as working with school, college and community partners, the University is committed to raising the profile of widening participation amongst its community of staff and students, and has established its WISeR Board with a remit to establish and review initiatives, strategies, policies and procedures that support and enhance widening participation and student retention.</p>
<p><span class="lead">What is Corporate Parenting?</span></p>
<p>Queen Margaret University is a Corporate Parent as defined by the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014.</p>
<p>A corporate parent is an organisation or individual who has special responsibilities for care experienced young people. Corporate parenting responsibilities’ extend to all care experienced children and young people aged from birth to when they cease to be looked after.</p>
<p>This includes children and young people: <br />• in residential care, in foster care, in kinship care, in secure care, who are looked after at home with social work involvement; <br />• care leavers who were looked after on their 16th birthday;<br />• (or subsequently) (the responsibilities continue to apply until the care leaver reaches their 26th birthday.)</p>
<p><span class="lead">What are Corporate Parenting duties?</span></p>
<p>Corporate parents have many of the same roles as parents. Corporate parents should do as much as they can to make sure children and young people feel in control of their lives and able to overcome the barriers they face. Section 58 of the Act outlines the following six statutory duties:</p>
<p>• To be alert to matters which, or which might, adversely affect the wellbeing of a care-experienced individual.<br />• Assess the needs of care experienced young people for any services or support provided.<br />• Promote the interests of this group of young people .<br />• Seek to provide care experienced young people with opportunities to promote their wellbeing.<br />• Take appropriate action to ensure care experienced young people can access opportunities and make use of services available to them. <br />• To review, evaluate and improve our practice and procedures to Corporate Parenting.<br />• To collaborate with other Corporate Parents when exercising corporate parenting responsibilities.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Why do we need a Corporate Parenting Plan?</span></p>
<p>We know that some looked after young people do achieve positive outcomes. Unfortunately, for most care experienced young people, the outcomes are much less positive, and can result in lower educational attainment, significant under achievement, with life chances largely reduced. Children and young people who are care experienced, or who are looked after, have the poorest outcomes of all children and young people in Scotland.</p>
<p>• Almost half of 5-17 year olds in care were diagnosed with a mental health disorder (Office of National Statistics, 2004). <br />• 33% of young people in prison and 31% of adult prisoners self-reported as having previously been in care (Scottish Prison Service, 2016). <br />• 73% of care experienced young people leave school aged 16 or under (Scottish Government, 2016). <br />• 35% of care experienced young people received 1 or more qualifications at SCQF level 5 compared to 85% of the rest of the school population (Scottish Government, 2016).<br />• Care experienced young people are eight times more likely to be excluded from school (Scottish Government, 2016)</p>
<p><span class="lead">Who are Corporate Parents?</span></p>
<p>The Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 places corporate parenting duties and responsibilities on the following agencies:<br />1. Scottish Ministers <br />2. A local authority <br />3. The National Convener of Children’s Hearings Scotland <br />4. Children’s Hearings Scotland <br />5. The Principal Reporter <br />6. The Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration <br />7. A health board <br />8. A board constituted under section 2(1)(b) of the NHS Act 1978 <br />9. Healthcare Improvement Scotland <br />10. The Scottish Qualifications Authority<br />11. Skills Development Scotland<br />12. Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland <br />13. The Scottish Social Services Council<br />14. The Scottish Sports Council<br />15. The chief constable of the Police Service of Scotland<br />16. The Scottish Police Authority<br />17. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service<br />18. The Scottish Legal Aid Board<br />19. The Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland<br />20. The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland<br />21. The Scottish Housing Regulator<br />22. Bòrd na Gàidhlig<br />23. Creative Scotland <br />24. A body which is a “post-16 education body” for the purposes of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 2005</p>
<p><span class="lead">QMU Corporate Parenting Plan</span></p>
<p>As a Corporate Parent, QMU is committed to working towards the National Ambition and Vision set by the Scottish Funding Council ‘for there to be no difference in the outcomes of care experienced learners’ comparative to their peers’ by 2021.</p>
<p>As a Corporate Parent, QMU aims to provide an environment where an individual’s needs are met at all stages of the student journey to enable them to become confident, responsible and effective members of the community. Although we cannot replicate some aspects of ‘family’ life, there are many steps we can take to ensure our care-experienced students feel genuinely supported while at QMU.</p>
<p>To help make sure everyone – children, young people, parents, and the services that support them – has a common understanding of what wellbeing means, The Scottish Government describe wellbeing using eight indicators. In part 18 (Section 96) of the 2014 Act the Scottish Government defines the wellbeing of a child or young person as the extent to which they meet eight indicators – known by their initials as the SHANARRI indicators. <br />The following diagram lists each indicator and summarises what it represents.</p>
<p><span class="lead">QMU Corporate Parenting Plan</span></p>
<p>The following table details Queen Margaret University’s plan for fulfilling its role as a Corporate Parent. For ease of reference the plan is divided into three sections:</p>
<p>1. Promoting Awareness and Raising Aspirations. <br />2. Applying and Admissions.<br />3. Pre &amp; Post Entry Support.</p>
<p>Within each section, we describe, in turn: <br />• Our core actions. <br />• Initiatives and Outcomes.<br />• Where these actions and their outcomes relate to the specific responsibilities laid out in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014.<br />• Who is responsible for each action.<br />• When each action will be completed and reviewed.</p>
<p>In line with recommendations in the Children and Young People (Scotland) 2014 Act, our Corporate Parenting Plan will be kept under continual review. This plan is referenced in our latest Outcome Agreement with the SFC. We will report on progress in our Care Leaver provision via the Outcome Agreement.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Named Point of Contact</span></p>
<p>Queen Margaret University’s Corporate Parenting duties are the responsibility of the whole institution, and do not reside with one individual. However, a central strand of our CL provision is to have a dedicated, named point of contact for care experienced or estranged students, and all related inquiries, both internal and external: the University’s Care Leaver Named Point of Contact is our current Head of the University’s Outreach and Community Engagement (OCE) team and has responsibility for the maintenance and development of our CL provision. Any queries about QMU’s Corporate Parenting Plan or our CL provision should be directed to Callum, or in his absence, Dr Iliyan Stefanov, Head of Student Services:</p>
