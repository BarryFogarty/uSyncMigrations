      <Value><![CDATA[<p>You will see, in the module descriptors for each of your modules, that the allocated hours add up to many more than your taught sessions account for. The other hours should be made up with self-directed study. This can be time spent engaging in some of the support offered at the University, but it will mainly consist of studying on your own or with some of your classmates. This guide provides some pointers on how to make the most of this self-directed learning time.</p>
<p>There are many learning resources you can access at the University, not just those provided by your module.</p>]]></Value>

    "content": "<p>Although it is good to make use of the extra sessions available at the University, the majority of your self-directed study hours will involve you studying on your own. There are many things you can do to make sure you are maximising your learning.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Reading</span></p>\n<p>Reading is one of the most important skills you will develop at University. You need to read in order to explore further the topics introduced in your lectures, to prepare for your seminars so as to be able to participate fully in discussions, and to research information that you can use to form the content of your assignments.</p>\n<p>On the Hub for each of your modules you will find your reading lists, complete with links to the electronic versions of the books and journals. You should check these out at the start of semester and start reading some straight away. Your lecturer may identify specific articles or chapters in a book to be read for certain seminars; there should be a schedule available on the Hub area which lays out what each week’s sessions will be about, and you can plan your reading around this.</p>\n<p>You can use the University <a href=\"https://sierra.qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Library Database\">Library Database</a> to access academic books and journals which you would otherwise have to pay for. Your reading lists are just the start of your reading journey and you are expected to find further sources for yourself. If you find this difficult, think about attending one of the <a href=\"/current-students/current-students-general-information/induction-for-new-students/learning-resource-centre-lrc-induction/\" title=\"QMU Learning Resource Centre (LRC)\">LRC Workshops</a> Much of your reading this year may be online, but do think about spending some time in the LRC to look for hard copies of books, and printing off some journal articles. It is often easier to read from a paper copy. Sometimes it might be more convenient to have a paper copy. Consider where and how you read and make paper copies accordingly.</p>\n<p>All reading should be active reading. There are various techniques to help you with this. See our guides on <a href=\"/study-here/student-services/effective-learning-service-els/active-reading/\" title=\"QMU Active Reading\">Active Reading</a> and <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/c4401dca6cf9441ab8a888063d8704e4}\" title=\"Making the Most of e-Resources\" data-udi=\"umb://document/2bd33059249b4887b49098cd05cbf850\">Making the Most of e-Resources</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Reviewing</span></p>\n<p>You should make time to review your notes from lectures and seminars. In sessions, you <strong>take</strong> notes; when reviewing you need to process these and make notes. This helps you develop your understanding of the topic as you will have notes from the lecture which help you prepare for the seminar and in turn lead you to further study. Try to use both these approaches to notes – don’t leave it at simply ‘taking notes’: <strong>making notes</strong> is the way consolidate the process.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Understanding</span></p>\n<p>Sometimes it can be useful to watch TED talks or YouTube videos to help you understand something in your module. These can be a good way to get you started if you are feeling stuck with something. They are also good as they are often short so can be fitted in when perhaps you don’t have time to get down to some serious reading! You can also watch them on the bus or train on you way into University to get a quick refresh on the seminar topic. Remember, these are not academic sources to be referenced, but just, often very useful, resources to facilitate learning.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Reflecting</span></p>\n<p>Reflective practice is being used more and more as a form of assessment at university level and you may have a reflective report or portfolio to submit as part your module assessment. However, reflection is also a useful tool for learning, even when it is not for a specific assignment. Get into the habit of keeping a reflective diary as this will help you identify what areas of your studies you need to work on more and what you are doing well in. Have a look at the ELS guide on <a href=\"/study-here/student-services/effective-learning-service-els/reflection/\" title=\"QMU Reflective Practice\">Reflective Practice</a> or have a look on YouTube where you will find lots of useful videos!</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The Hub</span></p>\n<p>Remember the Hub is the key place to get information about your modules and it is also a place to engage in some self-directed study. There are various features on the Hub which your lecturer might use to communicate with students. One which is often used is a the discussion board; if your lecturer sets up a discussion board for your module, be sure to engage with it as it is a space in which to share and exchange ideas with other students on your course, students to whom you might otherwise not speak. Check out this video and information on <a href=\"https://help.blackboard.com\" title=\"QMU Blackboard discussion board\">discussion boards</a> <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">to help you make the most of the feature. Also, check out the other features of <a href=\"https://hub.qmu.ac.uk\" title=\"QMU Hub\">the HUB</a></span></p>"

If the weather is nice, you could consider having a meeting outside in the campus grounds, or if it is raining, then you could go to the canteen or the Students’ Union.</p>"
