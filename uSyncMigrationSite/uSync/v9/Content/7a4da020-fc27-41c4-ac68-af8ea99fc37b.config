      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The University recognises that bullying and harassment can have a serious detrimental effect on the confidence, morale, performance and health of those affected, and may in extreme circumstances ultimately lead to students withdrawing from studies. The University believes that this situation should never be permitted to materialise and will treat all reports of bullying and harassment seriously.</p>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to promote a culture where bullying and harassment are acknowledged to be unacceptable and are not tolerated under any circumstances. Where allegations of such behaviour occur, this policy seeks to ensure that they are dealt with fairly, and in a timely fashion, without fear of victimisation.</p>]]></Value>

    "title": "Harassment Defined",
    "content": "<p>The definition of harassment in the Equality Act 2010 is wide. It is ‘where a person (A) engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic and the conduct has the purpose or effect of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>violating another person's (B's) dignity, or</li>\n<li>creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for B’</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It should be noted that 'unwanted' does not mean that express objection has to be made, and a serious one-off incident can amount to harassment.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that differences of personality traits or culture and the misinterpretation of social signals can mean that what is perceived as harassment by one person may not seem so to another. The defining feature, however, is that the behaviour is offensive or intimidating to the recipient, and as such would be regarded as harassment by any reasonable person. It would need to be considered that, if the purpose of the conduct was to violate the individual’s dignity or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment, then this is sufficient to establish harassment. However if harassment was not the purpose, but an individual argues that this was the effect of the conduct, the Equality Act says that in deciding whether conduct has that effect, consideration must be given to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the perception of the claimant;</li>\n<li>the other circumstances of the case; and</li>\n<li>whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have had that effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forms of harassment involve offensive conduct or behaviour directed at a person’s racial origin, religion and beliefs (including non-belief), gender, disabilities, sexual orientation, age, family status (including their role as a carer or as a part-time worker, fixed term worker), marital status, political opinion, socio-economic status, or because he/she is a member of a trade union or similar associations or some other personal characteristic. It can also include the inappropriate use, or threat of use, of physical and mental power, authority or through social media.</p>\n<p>With regard to religion and belief, it should be noted that there may be cultural differences which make some forms of behaviour generally regarded as acceptable by one group and unacceptable to another because such behaviour does not form part of the normal social interaction of that particular group.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Examples of potential harassment could be:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unwanted physical contact or physical attack.</li>\n<li>Offensive, suggestive or derogatory remarks, gestures, mockery, taunts, pranks, jokes, insults or ridicule; in person, on the telephone, by emails or social networking sites.</li>\n<li>Verbal abuse, threats or intrusive questioning.</li>\n<li>Insulting remarks based on the grounds of personal appearance or personal circumstances.</li>\n<li>Using an individual’s known disability to demoralise them.</li>\n<li>Leering at another individual’s body.</li>\n<li>Compromising invitations or gifts.</li>\n<li>Requests or demands for sexual favours.</li>\n<li>Circulation or displays of offensive, suggestive or degrading materials (such as pictures, graffiti or objects) in the teaching, learning, living or working environment.</li>\n<li>Sending of unwanted messages via e-mail and social networking sites.</li>\n<li>Ridicule for cultural differences such as appearance, dress, diet, religion or ethnic background.</li>\n<li>Subjecting an individual to group pressure.</li>\n<li>Derogatory or belittling remarks in front of others regarding appearance, work or personal attributes.</li>\n<li>Deliberately or repeatedly ignoring someone.</li>\n<li>Unwarranted exclusions.</li>\n<li>Any comments which imply that gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, race or ethnic or national origins, religious or other belief impairs the individual’s ability to perform satisfactorily.</li>\n<li>Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct.</li>\n<li>Incitement to commit any such act.</li>\n</ul>"

This is a form of direct discrimination. The key point to note is that the person bringing the claim does not need to have the protected characteristic (i.e. the protected characteristic can belong to another person). It is sufficient that the treatment is because of a protected characteristic. A student may also be able to bring a claim for harassment in those situations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Perceptive Discrimination</span></p>\n<p>This occurs when the protected characteristic is a perceived characteristic which the individual does not actually have. An individual may also be able to bring a claim for harassment in those situations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">Indirect Discrimination</span></p>\n<p>This occurs when a condition is applied equally to all students but one group is particularly disadvantaged, and this disadvantage cannot be justified as being necessary for the efficient running of the University.</p>"

It may be by an individual against an individual or involve groups of people. It may be obvious or it may be insidious (such as ignoring a person).</p>\n<p>Bullying can result from a misuse of individual power derived from perceived superior status/position, physical strength or force of personality.

Where it can be demonstrated that circumstances have prevented the individual concerned from raising the complaint within this time frame, the University will consider whether to allow an extension to this time scale.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The Informal Procedure</span></p>\n<p>Every effort should be made for parties to aim to resolve issues informally in the first instance. If a student feels that he or she is being bullied or harassed by another student or by a member of University staff, he or she is encouraged first of all to seek to try to resolve the matter informally. As a first step, the student should try to make it clear to the person causing</p>\n<p>the offence that such behaviour is unacceptable, is unwelcome and should be stopped. This will sometimes be sufficient to put an end to the behaviour in question, as in some cases the person against whom the complaint is directed might be unaware that his or her behaviour had inadvertently caused offence. Where this is the case, it is likely that the inappropriate behaviour ceases quickly.</p>\n<p>If students require any help or advice, they may consider approaching, for example, one of the following people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their Personal Academic Tutor</li>\n<li>The Programme Leader</li>\n<li>A member of Student Services</li>\n<li>A trusted friend</li>\n<li>A supportive lecturer or any other member of academic staff</li>\n<li>The Students’ Union</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"lead\">The Formal Procedure</span></p>\n<p>It is accepted that there may be instances where the nature of the complaint is too serious to be dealt with informally and it is necessary to undertake a formal investigation of the complaint from the outset. It may be that a student feels unable to approach the alleged bully or harasser informally from the outset, or that, due to the nature of the alleged conduct, this is not appropriate. Formal proceedings may also be appropriate where a previous attempt at an informal resolution has been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The student involved should set out the complaint, in writing, to the University Secretary. Complaints can be raised individually or as part of a group acting together. The student may be required to attend a meeting to give their side of events.</p>\n<p>An Investigating Officer will be appointed by the University Secretary to conduct an investigation into the alleged bullying or harassment.</p>\n<p>Where the complaint is by a student regarding alleged behaviour by another student, the investigation will be carried forward under the Student Disciplinary Procedure. Where the complaint is by a student regarding alleged behaviour by a staff member, the investigation will be carried forward under the Staff Disciplinary Procedure, and will be overseen by a member of the Human Resources Team.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the investigation, via either route, is for the University to establish a fair and balanced view of the facts relating to the complaint. The extent of investigation required will depend on the nature of the allegations and will vary from case to case. The Investigating Officer will conduct a full and thorough investigation as speedily as possible and document the results.</p>\n<p>It is important that any student alleging bullying or harassment co-operates fully and promptly in any investigation. This will include providing details of the names of any relevant witnesses, disclosing any relevant documents to the investigating officer and attending investigative interviews if required.</p>\n<p>The investigation may involve interviewing and taking statements from the student(s) and any staff member(s) involved and any witnesses, and/or reviewstaff member(s) involved and any witnesses, and/or review</p>\n<ul>\n<li>establish the nature and circumstances of the alleged offence or problem;</li>\n<li>allow the complainant to provide details of his or her version of events to the investigating officer; and</li>\n<li>take into account any personal or mitigating factors that may come to light during the investigation.</li>\n<li>Where the investigation is in relation to an allegation of bullying by a member of staff carried forward under the Staff Discipline Procedure, the decision on whether or not a complaint is upheld will be made by Human Resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After completing the investigation under the appropriate procedure, the investigating officer will provide the University Secretary with a report and recommendations arising from the investigation. On the basis of the report, the University Secretary will advise the complainant in writing whether the complaint is upheld or not upheld.</p>"
