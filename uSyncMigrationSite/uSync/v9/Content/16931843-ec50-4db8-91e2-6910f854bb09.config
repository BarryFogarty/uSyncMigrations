    "content": "<p><strong>What is resilience? </strong></p>\n<p>Resilience has been defined by Windle (2011) as ‘the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing sources of stress or trauma’. </p>\n<p>Researchers at QMU have developed a resilience framework in partnership with NHS Lothian, a range of third sector partners, and older people in Edinburgh<strong><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article/5/3/igab030/6350761\" title=\"Whitehall et al (2021) (external Link)\"> Whitehall et al. 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/62/9/e520/6338665\" title=\"Gorska et al (2021) (External Link)\">Gorska et al., 2021</a></strong>. The framework can be used to facilitate person-centred conversations about older peoples’ resilience and recognises that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>resilience can change over a person’s lifespan (i.e., it is a dynamic construct),</li>\n<li>resilience is influenced by a range of personal and environmental factors (i.e., it is a multi-dimensional construct).  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resilience framework includes a questionnaire made up of 34 items which capture older adults’ perceived resilience. The questions reflect the needs all humans have, including basic needs, such as health and wellbeing, access to resources, safety and comfort (the roots); the need for belonging and self-esteem (the tree trunk); and the need for self-fulfilment (the tree crown)</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2: Reset tree icon</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"?width=480&amp;height=384\" alt=\"Reset Tree\" width=\"480\" height=\"384\" data-udi=\"umb://media/5383b9c052444f0ab82eb8d06e14a2f5\"></strong></p>\n<p>We will use the resilience framework research to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>find out how older people feel about their resilience,</li>\n<li>identify the needs and assets that are most important to older people accessing the Reset model of support,</li>\n<li>facilitate outcome measurement.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is the community navigator / social prescribing approach?</strong></p>\n<p>Social prescribing involves linking people with non-medical assets and resources in their community. It is advocated by policy makers nationally and internationally.  </p>\n<p>A community navigator/ social prescribing approach was piloted by Cyrenians in North East Edinburgh from 2019 to 2020 <strong>[insert link to Community Navigator report].</strong> This pilot project used social prescribing and collaborative intersectoral working to help older people with long term conditions, who were facing multiple socioeconomic barriers, to navigate sources of non-clinical support and strengthen their links with people around them.</p>\n<p>We will evaluate, through qualitative methods, how best to use the community navigator approach to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>harness non-statutory community assets,</li>\n<li>build capacity,</li>\n<li>support sustainability of public services,</li>\n<li>support older people’s health and wellbeing through increasing their community resilience.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is the Incite model?</strong></p>\n<p>We will use the Incite model of intersectoral partnership to guide our research process <a href=\"https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/handle/20.500.12289/11421\" title=\"Irvine Fitzpatrick et al (2021)\"><strong>Irvine Fitzpatrick et al., 2021</strong></a>. The ‘Incite’ model identifies the mechanisms and spaces characterising successful collaboration between agencies located within different sectors (e.g., statutory sector, third sector). It also highlights the importance of sharing perspectives, skills, and resources across different sectors to encourage innovative, creative, holistic, and nuanced responses to people’s needs. </p>"
